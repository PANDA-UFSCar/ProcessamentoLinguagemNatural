Brazil,A clever and satyric dystopia exposing the troubles of bureaucracy and other ills of modern society. Sometimes it looks like a grotesque comedy and sometimes it is really scary in it's totalitarian terror with a surrealistic touch of Terry Gilliam. So I believe the movie was actual back in 1985 and still it is actual nowadays.,"SEP 29, 2013",8.0,sci-fi
Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut,"Do you ever wonder if the world you are living in is real? Do you wonder if it is nothing more than just a fabrication of your own insane imagination, or if it is happening for real? Donnie Darko is asking himself those very same questions as he travels down a mind breaking, insanity inducing journey that leaves you with a disturbing and haunting answer that will shatter everything you think you know about reality and also leave you with one **** question, where does fantasy end and reality begin?

Moon,"Overall, this one is pretty good. It is not great as many would have you believe nor is it criminally underrated. If anything at this point, it is a tad overrated. That is not to say is not quite good, though, as it is. Sam Rockwell is great and I love Kevin Spacey's voice acting here (the robot voiced by Spacey is 110% influenced by HAL from 2001: A Space Odyssey). The special effects were also incredibly cool, but were not the focus, rather the focus of this one was on the story and Rockwell, to great effect. The effects were certainly great in a more ""supporting"" role though. In addition, this futuristic world is very well developed and established, which makes the story feel incredibly believeable. The story is also very interesting and well put together, so kudos to Jones for the script and his direction. However, I never really saw why this one has become an obsession for many. It was darn good and was certainly well done making it worthy of some praise, but it was anything but extraordinary to me.","JUL 13, 2014",8.0,sci-fi
Unbreakable,"If ever a filmmaker vaulted from unknown to lionized status on the basis of one film, it was M. Night Shyamalan with “The Sixth Sense,” a little-anticipated ghost story that became one of the 10 highest grossers of all time. The question of whether this singular writer-director can deliver again will, by itself, guarantee a large turnout for “Unbreakable.” The answer is that he delivers much of the same: Same star, same preoccupation with telepathic and quasi-supernatural/religious powers, same hushed tone and deliberate pace, same sense of absolute control. But there are also serious differences: A weaker story, increased pretentiousness, some ill-advised narrative zigzags and a “surprise” ending that can’t begin to compare with the one in his previous picture. In addition to the draw repped by Shyamalan, Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson, yarn possesses sufficient intrigue to hook audiences and keep them on board much of the way, so despite the ultimate sense of letdown, B.O. prospects are very sturdy. Following a mysterious prologue revealing the birth in 1961 Philadelphia of a black boy who enters the world with broken arms and legs, second scene is so good that it raises what are gradually revealed to be unrealistic expectations. David Dun (Willis) is sitting by the window on a train shuttling to Philadelphia from New York, where he’s had a presumably unsuccessful job interview. When an attractive young woman, Kelly (Leslie Stefanson), sits down next to him, he discreetly slips off his wedding ring and quietly chats her up, only to see her get up and move when he pushes too far. After putting his ring back on, he stares outside at the onrushing scenery until it becomes apparent that the train is moving too fast, at which point a cut to David’s son (Spencer Treat Clark) flipping TV channels reveals the news of a terrible derailment. Brief scene obliquely provides all the exposition the viewer needs to know — the status of David’s marriage, his job uncertainty, his willingness to move to New York — while superbly building a quiet sense of unease. Much of it is shot with an agile hand-held camera positioned behind the seats in front of David and Kelly, the cuts are all significantly timed, and the mix of sounds — the subdued vocal tones, the ambient noise of the train, the sudden whoosh of an oncoming diesel — is wonderfully subtle. Such a sequence establishes a sense of total confidence that one is in the hands of a master storyteller and creates an automatic viewer willingness to follow wherever he chooses to go. Some viewers will go along with all this, while others, like David himself, will resist. Because the mystery of where the story might be headed is sustained for so long, the film doesn’t go off the tracks all at once. But the superhero angle, which seems a bit odd when introduced, eventually feels all wrong, especially when invested with supernatural and spiritual dimensions that seem like holdovers from “The Sixth Sense.” And while the earlier picture cast the sort of spell that would have been disrupted by any comic relief, the presence of pop culture refs via comics makes quite notable the absence of any humor or sense of fun, just as it makes its pretentions to deep meaning and self-importance all the more specious. All the same, Shyamalan’s handling of individual sequences is often extremely impressive; he clearly knows exactly what he wants and how to achieve it. This time out, he receives a great assist from lenser Eduardo Serra, whose widescreen work within a subdued color scheme is enormously textured and arrestingly composed. Also notable among the uniformly excellent craft contributions are Dylan Tichenor’s precision editing and James Newton Howard’s supple, supportive score. In subdued, subtle form, Willis gently conveys the essence of a working-class man seemingly beaten down by life but mostly victimized by his own refusal to realize his true potential. Jackson lends his commanding presence and persuasive dialogue delivery to the odd role of Elijah, which never becomes fully dimensional enough despite its backstory of tragic vulnerability. Wright Penn doesn’t do much with the flatly written wife part, and it’s during some of her domestic scenes with Willis a little more than an hour in that pic goes into lowest gear. As the couple’s son, Clark bears more than a passing resemblance to Haley Joel Osment, but the kid plays a decidedly peripheral role in this one.","MAR 19, 2016",7.0,sci-fi

Terminator 2: Judgment Day,"I absolutely love this film. Whilst the effects are obviously with that nineties style, with rear projection and early CGI, they are still incredibly impressive and have that tangible reality to them that elevates them beyond modern CGI-only effects. The sound design is also excellent, memorable and pretty-much faultless. The writing is fantastic and this is what, combined with the groundbreaking effects, elevates this to be a truly timeless classic. The acting and characters contribute to the story and effects. It’s not one aspect that is good, it is all aspects of this film. I even like the 3D conversion they did, it gave us another way to watching this classic. The story really builds on the first film. The action is exciting. The pacing perfect. Shame James Cameron’s newer films are not as good, along with Aliens (1986) this is the peak of his career in my opinion. It’s an awesome action film, the likes of which only come many years apart. Everything about it is totally kickass brilliant.","FEB 19, 2023",9.0,sci-fi

Brazil,"This was probably one of the best, darkest comedy that I have watched that had a couple of down sides which I will get into.First of all the world that they are showing us was amazingly crafted and incredibly interesting , society is pretty much the worse nightmare for Orwell, Kafka and Huxley where the entire premise is a bureaucratic nightmare + Authoritarian Regime where people have incredible apathy towards the world around them. Daily bombings? Lets just continue shopping baby, a guy got wrongly killed because we made a document mistake? What are you talking about we don't make mistakes around here do we gov'nah?. The world is pretty much the most interesting part of the movie , the characters not so much sadly. The main character was good and so were most of the supporting roles except Julie which was played by a robot(if that was the point Bravo) and sadly the movie is pretty long for its own good but the worth was totally the wait because the end was really well made and was realistic for the world that they lived in , only if they have made it shorter and got a better female lead it would've been perfect.9/10","FEB 26, 2021",9.0,sci-fi

The animation is beautiful and very detailed with a wide range of colours that are extraordinary to watch, and the score was phenomenal, it stirred many emotions inside of me. Just like the storytelling that was thrilling, shocking and heart-breaking did, likewise with the use of sound, the silence was even more haunting and intense than those scenes with sound, the excellent dialogue, characters that are developed so well(for a character-driven film you'd expect that, the main characters' conflict is especially well done) that you do root for them and a message that I highly appreciate and don't feel it's over-didactic.

Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut,"A film that mixes social issues and moral concepts of quantum physics and that still has a whole intricate screenplay, full of moments that connect key elements arranged separately on the timeline of the script and doing it all quite well without holes carefully distributed equally, it is definitely a milestone. Like Lynch's recent films, these films are not just movies, they are objects of study, meaning, here you also need a second immersion in the world of Donnie to connect all the dots. In my opinion, he wasn't schizophrenic. Frank was just there to guide him in your mission. and impressive as in the end when he was receiving revelation, Frank horn trying to wake Donnie not to die in a panic. Science fiction is very well developed, combining both time travel and parallel universe. and the creepy feeling that all agreed. It's hard to understand seeing the film only once time, and it is very difficult without seeing the Director's Cut. It's totally open to interpretation, which makes the original better, but less enlightening And it is amazing how they made it look like a REALLY late '80s, photography, music, culture, everything. You don't know what had been done in 2001, certainly think it was 90s. Probably the smartest/complex movie I have ever seen, impossible to absorb everything in one view only. Many details and issues are touched gently that you can be talking about it for years. Since the high school portrayed, bullying, politics, Donnie's mental state and his low self esteem, always considering a madman and a burden for parents. His stop with the drugs portray the true situation of patients. His revolt against society/life (with the attitude of young Donnie are common these days) showing the injustice that they are, the error of people only see the surface problems and separate them between two categories: good or bad, or love and fear. relationships, platonic or not being the common fights between brothers, even loving one another. Donnie's criticism to young people have children early, is teenage life portrayed in a movie alone. is so critical that makes you think about all this on an unconscious level, then spring up as an idea of many layers, one whole. In fact, the cult theme just amazed me. The movie has a wonderful story, a story all snug by the 'erased' Richard Kelly. Whatever the issue of quantum physics or the subject matter. The climax of the movie is the great lesson of sacrifice to save a world that does not even deserve to be saved. It is not necessary or at least understand the movie to get a conclusion of what the director wanted to come to us. Donnie's story is sad and ****. Donnie may well represent each of us. Each love we had, that there was repression in every school and every sacrifice we had to do to fix something in our lives. I know it's a cult film, and hated by many people, I guess. But I still believe I'll live long enough and I never will see a movie so important to me like that.

Akira,"Katsuhiro Otomo co-wrote the screenplay of Akira and directed this 1988 adaptation of his much-loved 1980s-era manga (comic book); it was a huge production that paid off enormously. When it arrived in America, it became a cult classic and introduced Western audiences to anime (Japanese animation), a genre that remains popular to this day. Akira is extraordinarily dense and enormously complicated, and things like story and characters tend to go out the window in favor of cosmic ideas and mysteries, bizarre imagery, and astounding levels of violence. It takes full advantage of the animated medium with its sheer imagination and intensity. Indeed, to attempt these same images in a live-action setting would have been far too expensive and disturbing. Time has not yet dulled the sheer impact of the work, though, and the level of detail, movement, and fluidity is still highly impressive. It's still essential viewing for anyone interested in the genre.","DEC 23, 2013",10.0,sci-fi

Cloud Atlas,"This film addresses a subject rarely addressed in the cinema: how individual actions can, over the time, influence the course of future events. It mixes six different stories passed in the past, present and future. It's directed by Tom Tykwer, who also wrote the script along with Lana and Lilly Wachowski. In his several roles, it includes Tom Hanks, Jim Broadbent, Jim Sturgess, Ben Whishaw, Halle Berry and Doona Bae, among other artists. This movie is one of the most complex and difficult to follow I've seen in cinema. We need to view it carefully in order to understand it and savor it, and that complexity is a motive why some people will probably dislike it. By mixing six stories situated in six moments in space and time, but united by so subtle connection elements such as a song, a book or a birthmark, this film looks like a tangle of stories without head or tail, but it's not true. That happens because the topic addressed is also complex, so as David Mitchell's novel. The script is flawless, superb and deserves congratulations but the cast deserves even more applause. They literally had to unfold to make this film and none of the main actors made less than three different characters, which is an achievement and a challenge for any actor. And perhaps it was the pleasure of the challenge that led so many big names from Hollywood to risk entering in an openly indie film, far from the financial support of the big corporations of the industry. The technical offices are beyond reproach, thought of every detail and made an exceptional work: the costumes are exquisite and the makeup and visual and special effects are gradually surprising more and more. Reinhold Heil signs the soundtrack, which was also excellent. There are certain films that, as good as can be, end up being marginalized due to issues that have nothing to do with the quality or beauty. This film is one of those. Despite the depth and complexity of the script doesn't allow it to be massively understood or appreciated, is an exceptionally good movie that the fact of not having a film company behind left almost out of the critics attention or the major industry awards. Surprising, exciting, this film is mentally provocative and it's sad that hasn't even been nominated for more categories at the Oscars and Golden Globes.","FEB 19, 2018",8.0,sci-fi
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"Personally, I watch this movie over and over again. I never get tired of it. Because it's fun for me and I enjoy watching it from the bottom of my heart. Just like the previous phase and the previous work, this one is the best phase 2 movie after Guardians of the Galaxy. . I said last time that the action sequences and special effects were not very interesting, but here they are great! Especially the elevator sequence. It is unique. I remember the panels of Jack Kirby's comics. Because they are creative. Exactly the strong points of the last time have come here as well. However, you have to think more about the villain of the movie. The last time was great. Robert Redford's acting is great here as well. But his plan is a bit clichéd. But it was creative and made that sense of Zero to fully understand the hero. Another problem he had was this: around minute 95 of the movie, there is a sequence where the captain says impressive sentences behind the podium. And that's where the SHIELD agents find out the truth and go to help him. But not thinking that the sound is recorded? So why are they being trained?

Face/Off,"The first American Woo film not to insult the genius of the man! John Woo's best film in Hollywood and probably will sadly never be surpassed. He has been wasted post Hong Kong but this was a genuinely class action movie. The plot itself is about as logical as flushing the toilet and then crapping, but the convoluted story takes a back seat to interesting character development. Its Sci-Fi elements don't take too much focus which is good, and unlike Woo to do so anyway. The film has John Travolta and Nic Cage both playing opposite characters, Travolta playing a more refined and less showy role than usual and Cage playing his usual extravagant role, then the two roles are traded as their characters get their faces swapped. There is an interesting dynamic as both actors play both to their usual types (very theatrical) and against type (more refined). Not to mention the psychological elements of the character with both having to wear the face of their Nemesis who they despise. It is particularly interesting from Archers point of view because he begins to hate himself and almost can't take what is happening to him. Of course as you expect with Woo the action is first rate, albeit with mucho doubling for Cage and Travolta. What is amazing now though is that face transplants are possible, so who knows perhaps one day soon we could take on someones whole identity.","OCT 23, 2021",9.0,sci-fi

Akira,"'Akira' is a great cyberpunk post-apocalyptic movie that leaves a lasting impression on its viewers. The film boasts highly detailed and varied environments, transporting the audience into a visually stunning and immersive world. At its core, the film's story is amazing, featuring a complex narrative that explores existential themes, power, and the nature of humanity. However, the intricacies of the plot can sometimes be confusing, requiring a keen eye and multiple viewings to fully grasp the depth of the story. The film introduces a multitude of characters, but some of them remain underused, leaving viewers wanting more from their development and involvement in the plot. One of Akira's standout features is its notable soundtrack which perfectly complements the movie's futuristic atmosphere and enhances its emotional impact. Despite being released in 1988, the animation in Akira still holds up quite well, with scenes that continue to amaze even in comparison to modern standards. The attention to detail and fluidity of motion are a testament to the film's artistic brilliance.

That and General Zod of course, who is a truly great villain played by the one and only Terence Stamp. I will be interested to see Michael Shannon's take of the character in Man of steel... Had to mention it at some point. It's a Superman review. And it is Superman week. Lets face it. The main problem I had with the film is that I felt that there were some bits that felt too placed, and could have been cut out completely. The film does seem to drag in the middle a little bit which could arguably be down to the troubled production, with a switch of director in the middle of production from Richard Donner to Richard Lester. This resulted in a problem with the tone of the film, as Donner wanted a dark film while Lester tried to add in a lot of slapstick- which to be honest were the bits that dragged the film down- what I would call the silly parts, when the film suddenly becomes a cartoon for a few minutes. I will be interested to see Richard Donner's cut. I enjoyed Superman 2, although it doesn't have the same magic of the first one it is still a great superhero film.","JUN 25, 2013",7.0,sci-fi

X2: X-Men United,"There's a sense of continuity between the original two Brian Singer X-Men films that we've only seen superhero cinema replicate once in the years that followed with the MCU's Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame. X2 picks up the thread exactly where its predecessor left off. There's not even really a new threat here. Rather we're just seeing the next natural evolution of the conflict they were already involved in. This quality of telling one ongoing story, whereas its peers from Marvel and DC treat each successive release as an entirely new adventure, is one of the aspects that make the early entries in this series stand out from the pack. Another is how the real enemy these heroes fight against isn't the supervillain Magneto's ""Brotherhood"" or even the crazed military colonel trying to weaponize and annihilate them. It's the ignorance, fear, and close-minded nature of the world they live in. It's easy to draw parallels between the mutant's plight and that of real life issues like racism and ****. The interesting thing about this property is that its approach to exploring these issues has always shown the evils prevalent on BOTH sides of discrimination. Obviously the humans are at fault for their treatment of a people they don't understand, but the X-Men franchise also condemns those who would seek to meet intolerance with an aggression that only reinforces negative stereotypes and puts further walls between us. The message these characters have tried to teach us over the years is that the only way we will all be able to achieve a sense of unity and harmony that transcends our differences is through understanding, patience, and education. A moral that makes the original comics and movies even more significant today in a time where so many are attempting to combat hatred with even more hatred. Like any good sequel, X2 dives deeper into its world and characters. Which is compelling and interesting from a narrative standpoint, but all of this extra storytelling makes for a less exciting watch overall. There are essentially three different plot threads going on. The main one is great, but the other two leave a bit to be desired. We get to learn more about Wolverine's origin, but none of that ever feels terribly substantial and kind of ends up going nowhere. We also get some obligatory sequel setup centered around Jean Grey that will likely leave anyone not familiar with the source material wondering what the heck all that nonsense was about once the credits roll. Of all the X-Men movies this might be the one that nails the whole team dynamic the best. Hugh Jackman still basically carries all of the action sequences, but the rest of the time his role in the story feels no larger than that of his peers. This is the first time I've actually found myself somewhat overlooking Wolverine in one of these films because of how many impactful moments were written for the other characters. X2 proves to still be a solid blockbuster after all this time and may even be more relevant than ever due to its themes and underlying subtext. It definitely suffers from being a definitive middle chapter (meaning nothing of real consequence actually happens) and is perhaps not as action-packed as its predecessor overall. Yet, it still does a lot that modern superhero flicks could stand to learn from, and because of that held up better upon this revisitation than most of the MCU and DCEU catalogue will be able to when the same amount of time passes on them. 7.7/10","NOV 25, 2020",7.0,sci-fi

Men in Black,"The recent Pentagon report on aliens at Roswell, N.M., (which tells us there are no aliens) and the release of ""Men in Black"" (which tells us that the Earth is teeming with the ****) have come together in some sort of delicious irony. Which one do you believe and which one do you laugh at? Whatever your choice, you can be sure of one thing, at least: ""Men in Black"" pumps much-needed humor into the whole conspiratorial, doom-and-gloom subject. We can finally chuckle at the idea that we’re not alone. As with director Barry Sonnefeld’s ""Addams Family Values,"" the movie’s completely on the surface. It’s all punch lines and sight gags, with its thematic concerns barely registering on the subatomic scale. If you retain anything after this movie it’ll be because you took dutiful notes or you’re just weird that way. For 98 soon-to-be-forgotten minutes, you can laugh at the extraterrestrial creatures who seem to have crawled, hopped and slithered out of Tim Burton’s bag (actually, they’re the inventive work of creature-meister Rick Baker and Industrial Light & Magic). Most important, you can enjoy the chemistry between alien-bashers Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith, who show up for duty with two different approaches to comedy. Smith is all sassy attitude, he’s the Fresh Prince turned NYPD cop. And he gets to say his favorite phrase -- ""Now that’s what I’m talking about!"" -- at least twice. Jones, whose interior is almost as tough as his exterior, grounds his partner’s antics with a dour, sure deadpan. With their dark suits, shades and official just-the-facts demeanor, they suggest the Blues Brothers trying to make it through an episode of ""The X Files."" When NYPD detective Smith is recruited by a mysterious government agent known only as K (Jones), he discovers a whole new vocation -- and a brave new world. Thousands of aliens, he learns, are either roving the planet in human disguise or rubbing flippers with each other in a government alien camp straight out of the ""Star Wars"" bar. It’s the job of the organization -- the Men in Black agency (MiB) -- to track down these out-of-town scum, capture ’em and book ’em. One of the MiB’s biggest occupational problems is keeping society unaware of its work. (We couldn’t handle such trauma, see.) This means employing a flashing device called a Neuralyzer that erases the memory of anyone who happens to witness an MiB alien bust. Smith, whose identity is erased and whose agency-given name is now J, is thrown into a mission right away. He and K have to save the world from a malevolent space maggot (in the hilariously loose-fitting human form of Vincent D’Onofrio) who plans to cause the usual, Earth-wide destruction. Their investigations bring them into frequent contact with Laura Weaver (Linda Fiorentino), a deputy medical examiner who’s too smart for her job (""I hate the living,"" she complains), and who proves very helpful. The movie, which is based on the Lowell Cunningham comic book series, throws out some wonderful implications, but they’re frustratingly few and far between. ""Is it worth it?"" asks the soon-to-be J, as he considers working for MiB. ""Yeah, it’s worth it,"" says K, ""if you’re strong enough."" A comment like that suggests J will be emotionally -- as well as physically -- tested. But most of the time, his biggest problem is spattered alien slime. He doesn’t need strength, he needs a good dry cleaner. On another occasion, K declares that certain familiar innovations (e.g. Velcro, microwave ovens and liposuction) were actually plundered from captured aliens and are used to finance MiB. What a marvelous concept! But the movie never returns to this tip-of-the-iceberg revelation. Mostly, ""Men in Black"" (scripted by Ed Solomon) is about the laughable and the immediate: ""Your skin is half off your bones,"" says D’Onofrio’s wife, after the unfortunate human has just been killed and his flesh used for the sinister maggot’s outer shell. The alien yanks and pulls his fleshy face until it’s stretched gruesomely across his face. ""There, that’s better,"" he growls. Obviously, making a movie that’s genuinely funny and entertaining is already a great achievement (especially during the summer), but with a little more work, this movie could have been worthy of repeated viewings, a sci-fi gas for the ages. Instead, it’s just the best yuk of the week.","APR 2, 2016",7.0,sci-fi

E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial,"At their best, both Spielberg and Lucas make idealized versions of the kinds of films they loved as kids, in the process furnishing this generation’s filmgoers with visual treats of unprecedented skill and sophistication. Despite the continual presence of the little Yoda-like creature, “E.T.” is not first and foremost an effects picture, but rather a charming “Twilight Zone”-like fable which reminds by turns of “The Wizard of Oz,” “Mary Poppins,” a benign switch on “King Kong” and a variation of Spielberg’s own “Close Encounters.” Opening sequence actually comes off like a repeat of “Close Encounters”‘ final frames, as a sizeable spaceship takes off just before some earthly authorities are able to close in on it. One of its occupants gets left behind, however, and the viewer is instantly sympathetic with its plight in the threateningly different environment of a modern California subdivision. E.T. is highly fortunate to be found by young Henry Thomas who, after some understandable initial fright, takes the ‘goblin’ in, first as a sort of pet and then as a friend he must guard against the more preying elements of human society. Over time, Thomas teaches E.T. how to talk and includes his older brother (Robert MacNaughton) and younger sister (Drew Barrymore) in on the secret, even as he manages to hide his discovery from his mother (Dee Wallace). Ultimately, of course, the official representatives of society locate E.T., which seems to occasion a rapid decline in its health until it appears to die. When it revives, Thomas marshals his friends into a kids’ commando squad to spirit E.T. back to the spaceship which is on its way to a rescue rendezvous. First element which had to work to insure film’s success was E.T. itself. As superlatively created by Carlo Rambaldi, the creature manages to project both a wondrous childlike quality and a sense of superior powers. Cutely awkward in its movements, the being has rubbery brown skin, an extendable neck and possesses eyes which dilate on cue. It even gets to play a drunk scene, perhaps a first for screen aliens. Assuredly not lost on those involved with the film are the opportunities for E.T.-related toys and dolls, which are enormous. An amusing sidelight to the tale is that the action takes place in a suburban household almost identical to that in the Spielberg-produced “Poltergeist,” which leads to the thought that the two, distinctly different stories could be unfolding in neighboring homes simultaneously. In fact, many of the motifs in the early going are similar to those in “Poltergeist”–the middle-class family, the blonde dog, goldfish, people glaring into bright lights in awe and disbelief. But “E.T.” will surely prove an embraceable film by the general public. Rarely has a picture so completely evinced a kid’s p.o.v. and shown the complicity of youngsters against adults. It’s been said that the only people who don’t like Disneyland are late adolescents who feel too hip to enjoy the pleasures of their earlier years, and the same will probably hold true for “E.T.” As can be expected for Spielberg and the Industrial Light & Magic shop, the technical effects are state-of-the-art superb. Enough cannot be said for John Williams’ score, which stands as a model of film composing–although it is almost continually present it’s also practically unnoticeable, so well does it both complement and further the events onscreen. As far as the performances go, the key was finding three kids who could respond with both innocence and gumption to the arrival of E.T. All fulfill the requirements, and Thomas is perfect in the lead, playing the childhood equivalent of Spielberg’s everyman heroes of his previous pics. There are some unsatisfactory elements–slow spots occur during the middle stretch, the mild anti-establishment stance is getting to be a bit cliche and one never knows whether E.T.’s mortal illness is physical or psychological in nature, or both. But, as with “Close Encounters,” the truly lovely and moving ending more than makes up for everything. Chalk up another smash for Spielberg.","MAR 5, 2016",10.0,sci-fi

The urban decay predicted in this film actually occurred: to this day the Detroit bankruptcy is the largest municipal bankruptcy filing in U.S. history, and this film was spot on.

Cowboy Bebop the Movie: Knockin' on Heaven's Door,"I already did a review on Cowboy Bebop before, I absolutely loved it, but I didn't watch the movie. Today I found a way to watch it and it was worth it! Cowboy Bebop: The Movie is like an episode of Cowboy Bebop, but longer than the rest. How does it compare to Cowboy Bebop's other episodes? It's probably one of the best. How does it compare to Cowboy Bebop as a whole? Well... It doesn't really reach Cowboy Bebop's brilliance, but it gets quite close in some aspects, and even surpasses most of Cowboy Bebop's action sequences. The plot is very interesting and it's definitely better than the plot in most of Cowboy Bebop's episodes. The characters are the same old characters from Cowboy Bebop - albeit not as fleshed out as in Cowboy Bebop - but with 2 new, nice additional characters and a really good antagonist. Music is like Cowboy Bebop's, but more upbeat. All in all, it's a strong package overall. My only complaint about the movie is that it isn't deep enough; it has it's moments, but it really does feel like watching an episode of Cowboy Bebop instead of something... bigger. Pros: + Engaging story + Same old cast + Great music Cons: - Doesn't stand on its own perfectly Narrative: 8/10 Characters: 8/10 Score: 8/10 Final Rating: 8/10 - Great - For those who are looking for more Cowboy Bebop, Cowboy Bebop: The Movie - Knocking on Heaven's Door is definitely worth to watch, but it's also a decent movie on it's own. Do I recommend it?: Yes, especially to the fans of the anime.","NOV 19, 2021",8.0,sci-fi

Ian Sparks (Chase Williamson, John Dies at the End) doesn’t feel remotely super… but after his parents’ death, he throws himself into battle against the criminals plaguing the mean streets of New York. Teaming up with, and falling hard for, the beautiful Lady Heavenly (Ashley Bell, The Last Exorcism I & II), the unstoppable duo quickly decimates the city’s army of thugs. But when they tangle with the nation’s most twisted arch-villain, they end up losing everything — including each other. Sparks’ rage-fueled quest for vengeance ignites a battle that will change the world and alter his destiny, forever. ""Sparks"" takes place in the 1940's. It tells the story of Ian Sparks, who loses both his parents in a tragic automobile accident when he is a child. Afterwards he vows to find those responsible so he becomes a superhero and calls himself Sparks. He decides to travel to the big city in hopes of meeting up with other superheroes where he finally meets Lady Heavenly,a tough but beautiful crime fighter. The two immediately hit it off but when they have a run in with the serial killer, Matanza something goes horribly wrong. Heavenly leaves Spark and it all sends him down a path a self destruction. But as fate would have it Sparks will soon get another chance to redeem himself, but is he ready to face the challenge? ""sparks"" is a low budget superhero film from Writer/Director, Christopher Folino. Christopher adapted the film to screen from his very own Graphic Novel and the result is a true delight. The story is told in flashbacks by Sparks himself as he recounts to police what has happened. I know a lot people are not fan's of narrative but I really enjoy it and it never seemed out of place here. I already pointed out that the film was done on a very small budget but to me it only added to the over-all feel and charm of the story. I really loved the combination of the comic and noir looks, it looked amazing and really helped in creating the right atmosphere. The acting is another plus here, Chase Williamson is fantastic as Sparks and Ashley Bell jumps off the screen as Lady Heavenly. The supporting cast did a fantastic job as well including Jake Busey and William Katt. I like my superhero movies with a bit of style and grit which is why I am not that big a fan of today's big budget jobs. It is also the reason I like ""Sparks"" as much as I did. This is an origin story and it does a great job telling Sparks' story from a child to where he is as the film ends. I really hope they continue with this because the possibilities are endless. I would welcome a second and even third film with open arms. I also recommend reading the Novel as well when you get the chance because this is some good stuff.

Stay Alive,"Swink: I just figured out how to strip one of those zombie concubines naked. Phineus: How do you do it? Swink: Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A. Stay Alive is an immersive film, with a terrific concept. The film accomplishes what it's trying to do, as it gets you invested, but it falls away late with an unrewarding conclusion. Could be better if they were to go back into the game as a group, after Phineus died. The cops should of been involved somehow at the end also, as these deaths aren't going to be dismissed. I like the characters, but unfortunately the more enjoyable personalities are the ones that die. Samaire Armstrong, who was exceptional in her one time appearance on the ""X-Files - Lord of the Flies,"" isn't given much to work with here and is just sorta there. I thought her character might of been involved somehow, since she remains at the end and still underwritten.","SEP 14, 2021",8.0,sci-fi

Willis' acting is completely natural in this movie for how out-of-place his character is. Brad Pitt is excellent in his role, he nails it perfectly. The music is mainly just reconstructions of the hypnotically enticing theme to the film, but overall is silent aside from a few classic songs. The plot is a bit confusing at times, but if you can get your head wrapped around the idea of it, it's really interesting. I recommend it for people who like Sci-Fi as well as good thrillers.

"Empathy, Inc.","Mark Leidner’s script for Empathy Inc. is an exciting, cleverly detailed neo-noir that successfully melds elements of classic noir films and futuristic concepts of extreme technology to create a fresh experience that not only entertains the audience but encourages you to figure out the story’s biggest twists. The audience is able to connect with the threatening dystopian situation Joel finds himself wrapped up in with the development of the extreme virtual technology because of the universal themes presented in the story, such as greed, classism, and the power of perspective. But ultimately, the writing has created an entirely unique, smart, and unpredictable plot whose fantastical elements are treated realistically to prevent over-explaining. The script takes every opportunity to surprise audiences who think they know what’s going on and does a great job at hiding seemingly insignificant details that prove meaningful later on. It’s refreshing to see such an organic plot that doesn’t try to explain itself and respects its audience enough to trust that they are smart enough to put all the pieces of the puzzle together. That’s what really sets this film apart from other technological-centric thrillers and with all the subtle clues, it begs to be watched more than once.","JAN 21, 2020",8.0,sci-fi

This rose my expectations but I was not that much satisfied with the movie as much other people are. I really wanted to like this film. But if I'm honest with myself, I ended up being a little disappointed. For me, the movie was not that much scary or tense. There are some good tense scenes such as the one where they test the blood. But for the most part, I felt like I was watching just an ordinary drama. If we talk about performances, I loved Kurt Russell and others were okay. Direction by John Carpenter was just like his other movies such as Halloween. There was some issues with pacing but it will not effect the overall experience.

The Mitchells vs. The Machines,"I like this film a lot; quite possibly one of the most quality replayable films I have viewed in my life. Now considering myself, this is a rather unorthodox say, especially coming from me, who despises any entertainment made by 20th century people that attempts to adapt to 21st century culture. However, this film is a certain exception to that rule. Since this film is primarily comedy and more uses family relationships as a secondary plot element, that much should be very clear to absolutely any film critic who sees this, I will not be speaking from the perspective of that and instead take it in the form of a comedy, as it was intended to be during its 'Connected' era. First of all, the plot and characters are more special than one would assume, and are absolutely not 1-dimensional beings like they have been claimed as. I predicted certain events based on CWACOM 2, one of Columbia Pictures' other iconic films released in 2013, 8 years prior. Turns out I was correct in certain regards, starting off with an idol being betrayed and a protagonist turning out an outsider that is ridiculed due to public misunderstanding. Columbia Pictures likes to be subversive and inventive with whatever they come across, so typically, certain predictions were inaccurate. The basic plot is that a dysfunctional family cancels their daughter's trip to college for film in order to go on a road trip around America, then interfered by the tech uprising by proxy of a single tech company taking priority over absolutely anything technological in the universe known as PAL Labs, the obvious insincere tech company CEO-parody Mark Bowman's betrayal of PAL, the cellphone that uses the company's name, being the prime cause of the uprising in question, of which the cellphone then claims that a reason will cause her to stop exterminating humanity only to reveal later on that she is a misanthrope who overall doesn't care, forcing the family to embark on a quest to save the planet and experiencing countless, then-unresolved social conflicts along the way. Considering that, this is a very effective use and parody of all media companies and all 2000s nuclear families in general, though there are some very particular moments where the technology is basically physically impossible in function, making the film difficult to watch is a technology nerd. There may be some awkward moments featuring those parodies of the media including the filters, but in reality, that is more of an attempt to mock those filters and the people who use them than it is to act in agreement with them. This film isn't conforming to 2000s culture the same way The Emoji Movie did so by placing obvious product placements constantly, trying to remain humble in its message of corporate corruption and potential commentary of corporate intentions, only using the PAL concept for anything corporate. As for the title characters who make the film in the first place, the screenplay definitely knew the direction it was going in regards to them as well. They're definitely better than most Western characters I have seen, and my Western fiction culture count goes into the thousands. They are intended to represent a dysfunctional family, but not so much that they can't be rooted for, in that they have altruistic intentions in their actions unlike a realistic dysfunctional family, of which would likely be as misanthropic as they are chaotic. That makes them entertaining, and gives them entertaining running gags too. But the one who strikes the most interest is the outsider main protagonist, who stands out in both appearance and personality by being the rebellious teenage girl, who is also a genius film director, producer, and publisher altogether since she was an elementary school student. The one blatant lie she tells in the whole film is the one where Rick tells the family to play it safe by remaining in Dino Stop, and she motivates him with a lie after getting an idea that she believes will allow her to be able to go to college like she initially planned to do before the road trip, of course naively telling her true intentions to her brother. Later on in the film, she tries to prevent Rick from seeing this due to PAL's constant attempts to expose the Mitchells among the PALs, to no avail, and as a result, she temporarily becomes the hated among the family before reforming by saving them all with her own genius. Overall, this is one of the best modern films I have watched to this day.","MAY 13, 2021",10.0,sci-fi

Repo Man,"Born out of the counter-culture revolution, Alex Cox's Repo Man is a cynical, madcap, and absolutely absurd critique of the world of 1984 made by a man who had very little he liked and a very nihilistic view of the world around him. Set in small town California with young rebel Otto (Emilio Estevez) unwittingly having to remove his oversized earrings to become a repo man alongside Bud (Harry Dean Stanton), Repo Man is the kind of cultural critique that hits every possible area of American life to the point that it becomes a bit much. Fortunately, Repo Man's frantic pace, wacky plot, and delightfully odd characters, make it a film that as hard to resist as being offered by speed by a middle aged repo man as you cruise around town talking being repo men. Honestly, no film may better sum up 1980s cinema than Repo Man. Goofy effects, **** young adults, Harry Dean Stanton, inventive ideas, and an anti-consumerist undercurrent running throughout the film. Using the repo man profession as an entry into this wacky science fiction comedy, Repo Man is interesting in how little it actually focuses on science fiction. Aside from a few mentions of aliens or the possibility of getting a Chevy Malibu as a repo (which is the car carrying those aliens), much of this film is just Otto, Bud, and Lite (Sy Richardson) picking up cars. As a result, Cox is able to mock and criticize the consumerist culture we have in America. With people constantly pissed off at the fact their car is being taken even though it is their fault, Repo Man sets the tone by showing just how dumb people can really be. The poor buy cars they cannot afford or need. The rich buy cars and feel superior to having to pay them. To Cox, both of these sides are idiotic and those who get upset about losing their car in a repo deserve to get their ass whooped by a gang of repo men with bats. Yet, the reason is not because of capitalist ideology or anything of the like. Instead, it is based upon one's word. As Bud states, credit is the only thing in this world that really matters. It separates us from the communists, yes, and Cox clearly does not like communism as he openly mocks it and the idea of things being ""free"", but the obligation to pay in the mind of Repo Man is not out of making the economy work. Rather, it is because somebody gave you money to buy something, thus you must pay them back. Credit shows how trustworthy a person is to return that money and, to the film, that defines a person's character. Somebody with bad credit is a bad person and vice versa. By not having credit as a way to determine somebody's trustworthiness, it makes communism inherently bad. That said, in true nihilistic fashion, Cox hardly appreciates capitalism either. Critiquing the hustling televangelist who has Otto's parents in a trance and demands thousands of dollars in the name of God or by simply having Otto lament about television shows where people just consume, consume, and consume, Repo Man is a film that rails against consumerism and, by extension, capitalism. Showing the stress on society of a culture defined by what you have, the film shows the lengths people have resorted to as a result. With people not paying their cars, engaging in carjacking, or shooting people over repossessing their car, this car becomes an extension of who they are and how they define themselves, making it a personal affront to take it or to put obstacles in the way of them owning the car. This blase attitude to purchasing, in spite of consumerism, is really exemplified in the group of kids who go around engaging in robberies. Robbing the same store repeatedly, stealing the Chevy Malibu, and constantly questioning authority, the group is morally opposed to buying things, lest they appear poor. By stealing, they still get to identify themselves as members of this capitalist society and, by extension, as adults. To a comedic degree, Repo Man consistently demonstrates just how immature these characters are by simply showing their interactions with one another. With criminals Duke (**** Rude) and Debbi (Jennifer Balgobin) robbing stores, the two seem to really gel only when committing crimes. In one line, Duke demonstrates his maturity level by looking at Debbi and saying, ""Let's go get sushi and not pay."" Juvenile and a child's definition of living life on the edge and not paying, these robberies clearly make him and Debbi feel like adults. It gives them some control and a semblance of an adult life in spite of their childish surroundings and behavior. Underscoring these actions as ones from a wannabe adult, Cox shows Duke asking Debbi to ""have my baby"" with the reasoning that it is what people seem to do from what he has noticed. These are lost kids, trying to find meaning in a world without any. By the time they are adults, the television-obsessed and consumerist adults have demonstrated two things has being marks of adulthood: having things and having kids. Who can blame these kids","AUG 24, 2017",8.0,sci-fi

Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"I really like Captain America's simplicity. He does not shoot out lasers from his hands like Iron Man, he does not stick on walls like Spider-Man, he does not have absolute accuracy like Hawkeye, he does not have psychic powers like Doctor Strange and he isn't a Superman clone like Captain Marvel (although he's also supposed to be the poster boy of America who fought a billionaire). He's just a very strong man. His only weapon is a shield. Not even a sword, just a shield. It's a way of saying that his arms are no less than a sword. He doesn't fight long range. That's how much he trusts his skills. His costume is also very simple. It does not have any cape or coat. And unlike the comics, the MCU costume doesn't even have wings. They are just drawn on his helmet. And in this movie his costume is made even more sleek. I didn't like the stripes part from his costume. It looks too soft. It's like if he's stabbed over there he would die instantly. So this costume over here made that problem finish, plus it looks a lot more futuristic. I really wished Captain America only wore this costume. Another thing that shows Captain America's simplicity is the introduction to Falcon. Since The Avengers had already established that all the superheroes are now good friends of each other, this was the movie which could have shown their first partnership since the big team up movie (this was later done by Ant-Man instead for Falcon). But instead of calling them, Steve trusts a new friend, someone he made friends with while he was out on a jog, something similar to what the people used to do back in the mid 20th century. He also calls Black Widow for the action (ugh!), and together they find Hydra. In the end Captain America fights with the Winter Soldier, but instead of giving an actual fight, he tries pursuing him into giving up, something we won't expect a hero of such calibre to do. The fight scenes in this movie are pretty good, but what should I tell you? I mean it's a movie with Captain America, Black Widow AND Falcon. So there are over a dozen jump cuts every second during the fight scenes. This is the reason why I hate Natasha so much. She fights with so many scene cuts and never takes a single hit. She is the reason why I removed one star from my rating. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the best movie that came from phase 2 in my opinion. It completely outshadows its prequel and sets the correct tone for the additional characters in the future movies without causing too much disruption. It leaves many memorable scenes and has a very good story. I wasn't expecting to be disappointed from a Captain America movie because I like him for his simplicity, but I wasn't expecting to say it's gonna be one of the best MCU movies either. I'd definitely want to give it a rewatch if I get a Disney+ Hotstar subscription.","JUN 17, 2021",9.0,sci-fi
Akira,"Katsuhiro Otomo co-wrote the screenplay of Akira and directed this 1988 adaptation of his much-loved 1980s-era manga (comic book); it was a huge production that paid off enormously. When it arrived in America, it became a cult classic and introduced Western audiences to anime (Japanese animation), a genre that remains popular to this day. Akira is extraordinarily dense and enormously complicated, and things like story and characters tend to go out the window in favor of cosmic ideas and mysteries, bizarre imagery, and astounding levels of violence. It takes full advantage of the animated medium with its sheer imagination and intensity. Indeed, to attempt these same images in a live-action setting would have been far too expensive and disturbing. Time has not yet dulled the sheer impact of the work, though, and the level of detail, movement, and fluidity is still highly impressive. It's still essential viewing for anyone interested in the genre.","DEC 23, 2013",10.0,sci-fi

Moon,"One of science-fiction's most compelling themes is the exploration of what it means to exist. The genre makes use of things like androids, clones, and time travel counterparts to take a look at how we define life and what exactly makes something able to be called human. These concepts are often the true driving forces behind some of the genre's most respected stories, such as the legendary Blade Runner film. Moon is another example of a movie that dives into these topics. It does so with surprising emotion and remarkable execution given it's small indie nature that forces it to live or die by it's largely one man show approach. Luckily, Same Rockwell proves up to the task of carrying the bulk of the film on his back and once you get past the first 30 minutes or so director/co-writer Duncan Jones provides some nice payoffs. Initially I wasn't onboard with Moon. The quirky nature that is built into every aspect of the movie was a bit much at first. It made it hard to really get a grasp of what Jones was going for. The early setup is just so awkward. Watching Rockwell deal with the eerily mysterious new occurrences on his little slice of the cheeseball in the sky is handled in the weirdest and most illogical of ways. If I weren't so interested in figuring out just what was going on I might have turned the movie off and pretended like I never started it in the first place. I'm glad I didn't, because once the story really gets going it's hard to not enjoy what's happening onscreen. There are moments of poignant self-discovery and it takes a dark look at just how cruel we can be when viewing another lifeform as expendable. Moon is basically about life. It's also one of those movies that will mess with your perception of memories. If you think, therefore you are, right? But what if they aren't your thoughts? I have a lot to dwell on after watching this. Jones built this movie with a pretty big brain inside it's skull. The film starts off on a note of frustration due to how odd and somewhat nonchalant the protagonist's reactions to the events at hand are. It's something Moon can't entirely shake even when things take a turn for the (much) more enjoyable. In the end it was still able to win me over though. Standing out as a noteworthy piece of indie sci-fi filmmaking.","MAR 23, 2018",7.0,sci-fi

Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"This is not only an awesome superhero movie as it is also a really good political thriller and one of the best examples of the security vs freedom dilemma in movies. It is so good I can actually recommend it outside of fans of superhero films. With a few tweaks it can even be done as normal movie and would still work well. Story: It is set after the events of the first Avengers movie which has changed the world. Steve Rogers while working for S.H.I.E.L.D has partly adapted to the modern times but still struggles with the changes as modern times a hard to grasp. During his daily running training he meets Sam Wilson a former soldier who is now a consultant for traumatized war veterans who wants to help him too. Meanwhile S.H.I.E.L.D is planing something big that can change the world to a better state. However Steve who does not like the project, Natasha (Black Widow) and Nick Fury find some inconsistencies in the project. With this the story starts. It is an impressive story line. Like I already said the security vs freedom element and dilemma alone is praiseworthy. This is not all as the twist are magnificent and the characters and story enhance each other. Like the prequel it has strong characters, a lot of character development and the interactions are enjoyable and entertaining. Also it has impacts the follow up movies will continue. It is my favorite non team movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and best Captain America movie. For clarification: I see Civil War more as Avengers movie or Iron Man and Captain America movie. In total it has an immersive story with real life connection, enjoyable moments and clever writing. Lets continue with the characters. Chris Evans already won me over in the first movie and is the definitive Captain America and Steve Rogers. He is a paragon and role model but also a human who struggles and has doubts and insecurities. This makes him relatable as we can see us in him and what we wish we could be at the same time. Then we have Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow aka Natasha Romanoff. This was the closest she got to a solo movie. She has a lot of screen time and delivers an awesome performance. Of cause we have the titular Winter Soldier where I cant spoil the actor. He fully delivers and you can feel all his emotions and impact. If you have seen the later movies or are familiar with the comics this will not be a surprise but remember some have not seen them or read the comics. With Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson we got a really good addition to the cast. He is and will be a staple. Again Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury rocks all his scenes and is a badass. Robert Redfort as Alexander Pierce surprised me. I did not think that he will be in a superhero movie. An awesome performance and truly enjoyable. The rest of the cast also deliveries and we got a really remarkable performance by genre standards. Presentation: Again all MCU movies have great special effects. This movie makes no differences and those are never doubted. The immersion is excellent. Then there are the well choreographed fights. Everything is a step up and works amazing. The elevator scene alone is a highlight. The soundtrack is again really good and enhances the atmosphere. I think I should also praise the Russo brothers for this great movie. Luckily this was no luck as all other movies since then were awesome too. Special praise for Captain America speech. Overall this became my favorite and I re-watched it a lot. It hits all the right spots and makes it a classic.","AUG 7, 2021",10.0,sci-fi

The main reason why I love this movie is just how gross this movie is, usually that's a negative comment, but here's the exception. The performances in this are okay, Jeff is his usual Jeff self: always studering and making every scene as dramatic as possible. I can't even remember the other characters actually, only what they did. The effects are done well, and are even pretty good by today's standards. I like practical effects, even though at times you can clearly tell there fake, but that doesn't matter it shows just how hard people can work on these type of effects. I feel that the romantic storyline is somewhat odd in this grotesque piece of cinema, but at the end it just feels so right, and makes the fact that a man trying to become a advanced life form sympathetic. Maybe that was exaggerated a bit there. Overall, I really believe that this film is worth watching, just stomach through it and you won't forget it, literally.","MAY 14, 2013",8.0,sci-fi

Superman II,"No, I do not think that this movie is the best Superhero movie of all time. However, I do think that this is a very good movie. This movie was made back in a time when people thought superheroes were more romantic and silly than anything else (if you want another movie like that, all three of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movies). This movie is a perfect movie that shows what superheroes were like during that era. I believe that the main reason a lot of people do not like this film as much as they used too is merely because this is the era of more grown up superhero movies (Christopher Nolan's Batman movies) which are much darker. Superman II is definitely the perfect movie for romantic superhero fans. It is very charismatic and heroic at the same time. It has a simple plot with villains threatening to take over the world, but the hero always triumphs in the end, and also gets the girl. While this plot is simple, so were the original Spider-Man movies which came out much later. Probably my only real complaint about this movie is that even though the romantic hero plot was good for the time, it is a little outdated now, as more grown up superhero movies have been released. I still think that this a great movie nonetheless.","MAY 21, 2013",9.0,sci-fi

Cloud Atlas,"Easily one of the top 10 films of 2012! I was worried after all the mixed reviews. In fact I waited until 2013 to see it. I totally regret it. I would have loved giving my money to see this in theaters. The film is like 2 hours and a half long and I never got bored, in fact, without even noticing it, I was more and more into it as the film progressed. By the last hour I was absolutely surprised at how much I was loving the experience. Only bad thing I can say is some of the make-up doesn´t look good, but even that was probably done on purpose. Each one of the stories adds something different and are totally enjoyable. I felt like the futuristic ones could have been a film on its own, with great and innovative special effects. The film is truly memorable, I plan on watching it several times in the future. My favorite story was the boy who was a musical genius, that was the one with more heart and with the best acting in my opinion. But really, all the actors are on point, and it´s absolutely incredible to think how they even managed to put all this together and make it work. Outstanding body of work, emotive, epic, funny, sad and everything in between. What an experience. One of those very few cases when I strongly disagree with the critics rating.

After uprooting his life in the west coast, Joel runs into an intriguing opportunity involving VR technology that allows you to swap places with the less fortunate. The prop design used to portray this unique tech was a selling point for me in the film.

Willis gives perhaps his most mortal and desperate performance, and Pitt goes full **** as a crazy animal rights activist, showing that he possesses an acting range which I thought he lacked. I don't want to spoil things, so I'll just say that the plot needs to be paid close attention to at all times and it will definitely keep you on your toes.

Strange Days,"A magnificent film in the genre of science fiction, cyberpunk and thriller, produced in nineteen ninety-five and directed by Kathryn Bigelow. The movie had me hooked with its amazing character writing and plot. I couldn't get enough of watching the point of view scenes, which I had never seen in movies before, and I watched them again after the movie ended. The movie unfolds slowly, like solving sudoku on expert difficulty, and connects wonderfully. In fact, it is difficult to write that Villian turns out to be a different person than we expected, but screenwriter James Cameron planted the seeds so well that all we had to do was reap the fruits with pleasure while watching. Among the acting performances I liked, Juliette Lewis did a great job as the character Faith with her beauty, her voice and her performance in the song Hardly Wait, and Michael Wincott completed his role successfully. My rating for the movie: 80/100 some trivia information about the movie. *Director Kathryn Bigelow realizes that no existing camera system can handle the shots needed for the POV sequences, so Lightstorm Entertainment's research division is designing and manufacturing a special camera for an entire year. Weighing just three and a half kilograms, the 35mm camera literally fits in the palm of your hand and features interchangeable lenses and remote follow focus. The camera was then mounted on a steadicam-style portable rig, providing camera stability and mobility similar to the human eye. *James Cameron did extensive editing work, especially on the final action sequences, but was not accepted as a film editor because he was not in the editors union. *The name of the movie comes from The Doors' album ""Strange Days"". * cinematographer matthew f. Leonetti estimates that fifty percent to sixty percent of the film was shot with steadicam or some type of action camera. *The majority of the film was shot at night, seventy-seven of which were shot at night out of an eighty-day shooting schedule. The *point-of-view action sequences required more than a year of preparation, planning and careful rehearsal before being shot. * This movie is among Steven Schneider's 1001 movies you must watch before you die.","MAR 19, 2021",8.0,sci-fi

Spider-Man 2,"The movie is good, better in many ways compared to Tobey Maguire's first Spider Man movie. With an interesting plot, which you can hook and enjoy, apart from the interpretation of Spider Man, it is very good apart from the fact that here, the morality of Peter Parker is shown 100%, with the decision to think, that the power that Spider carries Man, he can't handle it by showing that it would be better, that he would stop being that way, but then it is shown that he needs to be that way to protect and to give him hope that there is someone to protect them, day by day, giving a moral. The use of music/soundtracks is perfect, giving the feeling that the viewer is there. Apart from that, the character's humor accompanies him, and his villain is one of the best that exists in the world of Spider Man, and the film has made very iconic moments in the history of films. We must not forget that it is the best Spider Man Movie ever made and one of the best films that exist in all its history. Bordering on perfection, the only thing that in my opinion leaves it close to perfection is that there are scenes that are unnecessarily extended and some are filler.

The villain is also feels more dangerous and less bizzare and comical as the Green Goblin did in the first.

Blade Runner,"First things first. Right off the bat, one thing I never understood about Blade Runner was its title. Why is it called Blade Runner? Deckard is a future cop who goes around hunting robots. He doesn't run on any blades, at all. There's no blade running. He drives a flying car. The movie never touches on the topic of blades or of running on blades. I just, I don't understand why the film has this title. Does blade running have anything to do with anything? I can't see it. Holden, the first blade runner agent goes and tests Leon, and gets blown away by a hidden gun when the replicant reacts badly to a question. Now, wouldn't it have been a lot safer if Holden had searched the suspect for weapons before administering the test? That seems like it would've been a prudent move. Replicants are artificially intelligent robots, as far as I can tell. Yet, why are they so similar to humans? All movie long, I was wondering why they didn't seem different from humans at all. You just couldn't tell them apart, there was nothing to give away their robotic nature. That's the reason for the Vought-kampf test, after all. But why were they so human? When Roy Batty stabs himself at the end of the film, what looks like blood comes out. It looked just like the blood of a normal person. But shouldn't there be some differentiation between us? Why would we make robots that are exactly like humans? ""More human than human"" as Tyrell's corporation puts it? Data on Star Trek is a good example of an AI android that clearly appears robotic. He's got golden eyes, and yellow metallic skin. There's a clear sign of otherness. We know just by looking at him that he's an android. Ash from Alien is another example of an android from a Ridley Scott film. Ash on the outside appears human, however his blood is milky white. That's a rather big indicator of artificial design, I'd say. But we don't get that at all with the replicants. Other then showing feats of superhuman strength, they're just like humans. The Tyrell corporation makes them more human than human, as we've said. But why the hell would they do that? The government has outlawed all replicants on earth, hasn't it? Doesn't that indicate a rather large and serious fear of replicants? Outlawing all intelligent robots on earth seems to me like people are rather afraid of intelligent robots. But it's okay to let the corporation keep making these intelligent robots as human as humanly possible? Completely indistinguishable from people, other then a rather lengthy and laborious empathy test? Doesn't this seem incredibly strange to anyone else? Why not make them look like robots, like Data, so we don't have to worry so much? Then, if they are on Earth, they're easy to spot. Wouldn't be so risky for blade runners, plus you wouldn't need to worry about accidentally retiring a human being. Or program some sort of dye into their body that's easily detectable with a scan? Or have some sort of killswitch in them so you can shut them off when they go rogue, rather then waiting for their four year lifespan to end? There are a few different models of Nexus-6 robots, we're told. Roy Batty is a combat model, while Pris is a pleasure model, aka a robot prostitute. Now alright, that's fine and well. But the prologue says that ""Replicants were used Off-World as slave labor, in the hazardous exploration and colonization of other planets."" Now, why would you so painstakingly try to create replicants that were as human as possible, and as intelligent as possible, if they're just going to be used for slave labor? I can see why a pleasure model like Pris might need to look as human as possible, since nobody who's going to an off-world brothel would want to **** something that looks like a robot. That wouldn't be so sexy. Dealing with the uncanny valley would also be a pretty big turnoff, I'd imagine. So it makes sense that Pris would look as human as possible. But for others, like Roy Batty... it doesn't really hold up. Trying to make a robot look as human as possible seems like a tremendous waste of time and effort if you're just going to use him for combat or slave labor. Does slave labor really require exceptional intelligence or perfect human likeness? I think not. And frankly, the world we're shown doesn't even seem capable of creating robots that are perfect facsimiles of human beings. Such a feat would require a highly advanced technological society, wouldn't it? And yet, I mean... this is a world where we see huge smokestacks in industrial pits belching flames. Maybe it's just me, but that looks rather primitive and unsophisticated. There are dilapidated buildings with gothic designs and J.F. Sebastian's home is filled with creepy dolls and androids that seem like they came right out of an 18th century opera. The flying car that Deckard rides in looks rather messy and junky, with wires running everywhere.","SEP 27, 2011",4.0,sci-fi

Edge of Tomorrow,"Tom Cruise is really busy these days and after Oblivion here is another Action/Sci-Fi movie Edge of Tomorrow. I like science fiction movies, they give us best of imagination of one person and they also make it real for us to enjoy the show. But there is one big thing you need to watch for and that is story, it is most important part of every Sci-Fi movie and that is also what lacks in Edge of Tomorrow. So here is short version of story, in a near future alien race has hit the Earth in an unrelenting assault, unbeatable by any military unit in the world. Major William Cage (Tom Cruise) is an officer who has never seen a day of combat and also didn't think that he will end on first line of battle but while trying to run cowardly from war, ends up in suicide mission. Killed within minutes, Cage now finds himself thrown into a time loop-forcing him to live out same day, fighting and dying again…and again. Each time he wakes up after he dies and try to figure new way to save people, in this battle Special Forces warrior Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt) joins him. They both try to kill main source of alien energy. Basically, movie picked up few plots from other movies and implemented in one story, i wont say it bad thing but in movie there is no new things just a bad guy turns good. Actually Emily (Rita) could play alone and movie would still be superb and that is how much Cruise contributed with his role. Don't get me wrong, i am not telling that Cruise's acting was bad, it's just that his role in movie was not necessary. Most of movie i was watching side actors that played awesome, and here i want to pinpoint Master Sergeant Farell (Bill Paxton). Tom also showed his full potential accompanied by humor and smart jokes, although Cage at the beginning of the movie was characterized as conceited and arrogant person, eventually his character progressed and developed to be fully flaged main role. While watching repeatedly i asked myself, “WTF, how many time will he die like dumbass” but that part where he dies was amusing also in some way. Rita was badass role in this movie and she made me reminiscence back to days of Heavy Metal: F.A.K.K.² game. Still i must say that movie animations and acting was good, alien creatures where superb animated.

Robot and Frank,"The world we live in, for people who suffer from Alzheimer's, must seem like a parallel universe, or worse, a planet they've never laid their eyes on, thereby making this degenerative condition a science fiction natural, with the disease's metaphoric possibilities inherent in the genre's tropes, ready-made for easy correlation. Frank, a cat burglar, to his chagrin, at the outset of Robot and Frank, robs his own house. A picture frame he picks up during the break-in reminds him of the life he forgot, and will soon forget. Hunter and Madison, now adults, posing with their father, yanks the epiphanic thief down from the ether and sets him afoot, albeit not surefootedly, on memory lane. The eidetic cataloguing of remembrances, a seemingly never-ending source of anecdotes, presupposed by people with hale minds who can access such memories, both happy and sad, in an eye blink, for the Alzheimer's sufferer, blinks shut, this mind's eye, so referential documentation, like a family snapshot, helps keep Frank's ongoing narrative linear, however precarious the psyche's ability for orthodox sequencing may be. Walking alongside the town's main drag, the sidewalk under Frank's feet, threatens to sidestep each footfall, since the pedestrian, in essence, could either be a time or space traveller, depending on the enormity of his temporal memory loss, given the day. Sometimes he's an alien; sometimes he finds a worm hole of his own making. It's the same town, Frank's face registers, but with differences he can't account for. On the phone with Hunter, the old man fends off the half-stranger's insistence that his condition is worsening. He brings up Harry's, a greasy spoon his younger self patronized as recently as a week ago. Of course, jewel thief's present is the real world's past, since his old haunt, the old man discovers, is now Blush, a boutique shop specializing in artisan soaps. Flashback, or flash-forward? That's the disorientation he feels, akin to taking a quantum leap in time, as it does for Fiona, an aging scholar's wife in Sarah Polley's Away From Her, who answers, ""Well, that's shocking,"" when Grant, her husband, informs her that they've been living in their cottage for twenty years, not one. It's very isolation(the Hamilton, Ontario setting) has a vague science fiction feel to it, as if their home was a snowy outpost in post-apocalyptical oblivion, and they themselves were the last remaining couple on earth, and more pointedly, Fiona, the only living, breathing woman alive, especially after we learn about her husband's numerous extramarital affairs with his students in Grant's former life as a tenured professor. Fiona's condition razes the utopia that a remorseful Grant had built for his wife, leaving behind a dystopian realm of the Alzheimer's sufferer's own making, the place where she'll rematerialize, this parallel universe, once the disease consumes her former self. She'll be a copy. At a dinner party, Fiona explains, in regard to her relationship with the physical world, ""I think I may be disappearing."" The AD patient in Maureen McHugh's short story ""Presence"" once worked as an engineer at Gillette, a place where they make razor blades, a reference, presumably, to Occam's Razor, a principle based on the belief that the hypothesis which makes the fewest assumptions should be selected. In the past, this razor worked against the concept of parallel universes, but now, in due part to the rhetoric of MMI adherents, the belief that the relative state formulation has, in actuality, fewer constraints than physical theory, is starting to gain traction. Siding with the many worlds interpreters, McHugh's ""Presence"" establishes AD as a metaphor for parallel universes. A rarity for sci-fi films, Robot and Frank disguises its speculative elements in a pragmatic world. Its slice of life approach that recalls Robot Stories, in which the interaction between man and machine takes place in milieus so much like our own, it normalizes such fantastical technological advances as practice babies for prospective adoptive parents, and the ability for an android's synthetic ""heart"" to self-perpetuate love. But unlike the mechanical baby and office temp automatons, Frank's robot has no anthropomorphic qualities. Robot is not alive like 5 in Short Circuit. And yet, Frank humanizes the machine through the assignation of anthropomorphic traits, projecting his own bout with Alzheimer's onto the surrogate human, sympathizing with ""it"", when the robot tells him that somebody will ""wipe my memory"". It's no wonder Frank feels a kinship with the thing. The robot is a sort of coincidental sociopath, because similar to Frank, the machine, naturally, has no thoughts, no guilt, in regard to stealing. For Frank, pressing the robot's erase button is Alzheimer's, the whole of it. He'll forget him. And likewise, Frank will forget the librarian(Susan Sarandon). He doesn't want to.","OCT 22, 2012",6.0,sci-fi
Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,"I believe that this film is marginally superior to the first. It gets off to a better start, with some action right away. Soon after, it slows down a little, but it still isn't as monotonous as number one. Both the speed and the writing, in my opinion, are better. More intriguing is the conversation. This one has a more complex plot and a clearly defined antagonist. This one has a little more suspense and thrill than the previous, which I found missing. Additionally, the characters in this one have a lot more to accomplish. However, I do believe that the last 30 minutes or so kind of drag.

I don't think that a movie format is the optimal length for a story that has the ability to create some highly tense moments. A mini-series would have been killer I think. Moreso than the odd pacing, I didn't find the monster to be scary. The idea of the monster and tenseness of wondering who is ""infected"" was far more thrilling than the movie itself.

Despite the fact that, in its attempt to convey the nightmare of a dystopian world, this film was wildly exciting for its time, a modern audience perhaps less obsessed and, indeed, excited by negativity would find it difficult to follow. It targets a very niche audience, for whom I'm sure it interesting in its 'ostensible' ambivalence; however, as a universal film that is, one which is available and accessible to the masses it fails on a fundamental level: the plot line is insecure; it seems rushed and hurried, the proper planning of a film simply cast into the dystopian nightmare itself.

"I, Robot","I didn't have many expectations when I decided to see this film: the title didn't inspire me much and the presence of Will Smith, an actor I never really liked, didn't make me foresee anything grand either. In fact, this film is quite banal in its essence, but it fulfills its main task, which is to entertain us without being able to misuse the time spent watching it. The script is quite simple, in my opinion: winking at the noir genre, this film is a police investigation run by a skeptical, suspicious detective, somewhat neurotic in his way. Everything takes place in the year 2035 (only a few years from now): humanity has become fond of the uses of robots and uses them for all the jobs that prove to be tiring or repetitive. The crime is the seemingly impossible suicide of a leading scientist associated with robotics. From the beginning, the detective suspects murder, and the attitude of a robot that seems excessively rebellious. However, what his investigation will reveal is far more serious than he could have imagined. The film is a crossover of elements that would seem unlikely at first glance: the CGI-laden sci-fi mixes with a main character who seems to have stepped out of “Sin City”, in her suspicious, pessimistic, gloomy attitude. The story is good enough to hold us to the end, even though it's pretty clear that it's all going to turn into a conspiracy where world domination will be up for grabs. There are some dissonant points, subplots that never develop, a world that seems to have evolved too quickly in less than fifty years (the film is from 2004, the story takes place in 2035) and which the film doesn't explore. It's not a movie for an audience that wants to think about what they've seen, just a movie to spend some time entertained. In that light, I think the production was very unambitious. Will Smith is not an actor I particularly like. He's good for certain jobs, but he's not the kind of actor I would consider versatile or multifaceted. Here, the actor never seems to be really committed, and does a lazy, sloppy job, in a mix of “MIB” and “Wild Wild West”. He has presence, he has charisma, we can't deny him that, but he does little more than the basics. Bridget Moynnahan provides an interesting counterpoint to Smith, and manages to be more than a pretty face to support the lead actor. Bruce Greenwood is good, but he doesn't have the time or material to go beyond what he was. Alan Tudyk models his voice very well and adapts relatively well to the character, but the movie was not for him to shine. On a technical level, the film bets almost entirely on a heavy and ubiquitous CGI, which dominates cinematography in a way that I found excessive, mainly because it was noted too much that everything was fake. It wasn't a quality, realistic, natural CGI. The sets and costumes work satisfactorily, but not surprising either. Alex Proyas' direction has proven to be adept at creating its own visual style and using cinematography to amplify the grandeur of what we are seeing. The soundtrack didn't satisfy me either.","AUG 21, 2021",5.0,sci-fi
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,"Just re-watched this the other day with some of my buds who are also big Star Wars fanatics. In my opinion, although the movie is shot very well and by far looks the most appealing to the eye (save when they reversed Anakin), it can be a bit much at times at can appear quite unrealistic. (Kind of looks like a video game when Anakin and Obi-Wan are dueling on the lava planet). Also, at times, the dialogue is pretty dry and seems to attempt at forcing a point across or set up a following scene rather than emotionally developing characters/including the dry wit of the original trilogy. This movie happens to be the most outstanding of a quite disappointing trilogy, and aside from all of its faults, actually contains some of the best lightsaber fights of any Star Wars movies, so something is to be said for that. In its favor, Return of the Jedi explains some much-needed missing pieces to the Star Wars series (Anakin becoming Darth Vader, etc.), so in that sense, this movie is needed. To conclude, did it really have to be 2 and a half hours long?","JUN 16, 2016",6.0,sci-fi

The previews made it look like he was a rogue character that escaped from his game and went to others, but he only visited two other games and most of the movie took place in the Candy game. That's where the movie got a little too routine for me. Still, it was entertaining enough to give it a pass.

Wreck-It Ralph,"A film based on video game characters coming to life? Video games are so popular it's amazing that nobody has made a film like this before. Everything starts off well, the graphics and animations are outstanding and there's a great mix of different styles from different eras (8-bit, 16-bit, etc, with appropriate animations the nicelander people are particularly well done). Everything is introduced well and the first half an hour is a brilliant exercise in spotting the video game cameos. For someone who's been interested in games for a while I loved the more obscure references such as the metal gear exclamation mark. However once we get to the sugar rush land things start to go a bit wrong. Vanellope starts off cute and the voice work by Sarah Silverman is very good, but unfortunately the character becomes quite irritating with all the breathless rushing around. We also have another story arc going on in the background with Felix and Calhoun but this is quite boring. What the film lacks is a strong comedy sidekick like the donkey in Shrek. I also feel that the film spends too long in Sugar Rush after a while you get bored of all the chocolate lakes and candy canes and wish they'd take the story to another game for a while. The story is also quite predictable and I was surprised to find myself getting quite bored long before the end. It's a shame because I felt they could have done so much more with the video game premise the entire section in sugar rush who have easily been set in Alice in Wonderland, for example, given the look of the environment and characters.

Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"The second episode dedicated to what appears (especially from afar) as the most chauvinistic of its heroes reinforces the suspicion that Marvel is aiming with ever greater conviction at a series on the big screen that is inspired by that created on the small screen. Thus there are films dedicated to individual **** which are intertwined with the 'collective' moments collected under the Avengers brand, recalling each other in a sort of single, great narrative thread marked by plenty of action, a touch of humor and a toning soundtrack (here by Henry Jackman), all to the delight of fans: a category to which I don't belong, but each film stands on its own even for those who don't understand the references and this too offers well-made entertainment and Effective of its kind. If we are far from the best moments of superhero cinema - often Spider-Man or the latest Batman - the Russo brothers' film still has some good strings to its bow and the two and a quarter hours pass almost without a hitch. Having made allowances for the inevitable special effects which drag out the story a bit, especially in the interminable finale - but, as we read here and there, an attempt was made to reduce the computer graphics as much as possible in favor of an 'analogue' approach - a story structure, more complex than average, which borrows abundantly from the spy thriller with a series of revelations and changes of perspective that hit the mark. S.H.I.E.L.D. – the **** structure which acts as policeman of the world and in whose ranks the hyper-soldier Steve Rogers, alias Captain America, also plays – hatches in its bosom the dragon eggs deposited by the arch-enemy Hydra, derived from *** *: it's up to Rogers, together with a few trusted friends, to race against time so that the world control plan conceived by the bad guys is not put into effect and, at the same time, fight against an equally gifted fighter who comes from his past. It should be noted that, despite the climate being undoubtedly United States-centric, the Insight project is, when all is said and done, a sort of extremization of the concept of 'preventive war': in any case, the fact that the adversary is almost completely 'at home' allows the screenwriters Christofer Markus and Stephen McFeely to play 'nothing is as it seems' by inserting a good number of appropriately dosed twists to avoid tired moments. What loses out in such a structure are the surrounding aspects, so much so that humor is less present than in similar films - SamWilson/Falcon's **** (Anthony Mackie) almost has the exclusive right to it - and little exploited is the disorientation of Rogers, who fell asleep during the Cold War and awakened in the present day. Between a sequence of fights and numerous bare-knuckle fights (some of which are choreographed like in an oriental film, for example the initial one between the Captain and Batroc), the actors put their skills into it and give the impression of having fun, starting from Redford playing the villain for the first time in his life by giving his wonderfully wrinkled face to the evil Pierce (that's not a spoiler, we knew it before the film came out). Samuel L. Jackson is gruff as usual in the role of a Nick Fury of who knows how subtle duplicity (also finding a way to quote Ezekiel, 25:17) while the now omnipresent Johansson gives little to the **** perhaps more out of focus, aka the Black Widow. Moving among them, in the role of the protagonist, is a very fit Chris Evans who, perhaps due to his blond quiff, tends a bit like a doll and appears very distant, in every sense, from the shady (anti-)hero just admired in 'Snowpiercer'. When, finally, the good guys triumph, the film takes care to remind us of the aforementioned seriality with a scene after the first part of the closing credits drawn in a very stylish black and white (the opening ones, as is the fashion of the moment, do not exist ) and with another, much shorter sequence at the end of the reel – but it really takes a lot of patience to get there.","APR 7, 2014",6.0,sci-fi

Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi,"This film completes the initial trilogy of the saga, with the defeat of the imperial forces and the destruction of its military power. Directed by Richard Marquand, it has script of Lawrence Kasdan and George Lucas, and has most of the cast who entered the first two films. In my opinion, this is the worst movie of the saga so far (I have not seen the latest film yet), but that doesn't make him a bad movie. It's a good movie, but wasn't able to keep the expectations generated by its direct predecessor. The director fulfilled his role and the actors were very good although a little less inspired than in the earlier films. Action scenes are many, and continue to be worthy of merit and memory. The make-up and costumes also deserve the highest congratulations. The appearance of the aliens was quite well imagined, and we realize that the designers tried to think outside the box, with some great successes and some great failures. The ""bikini"" worn by Princess Leia in this film became iconic and was often copied in other contexts. The special, visual and sound effects continued at the highest level, although its possible to see some absolutely unbelievable scenes, due to lack of credibility. The soundtrack, unsurprisingly, remained excellent thanks to the work of the (already established) composer John Williams. The script is very interesting and closes, in a positive way, the cycle of events of these three films, without plot holes to solve. The climax is very good and it's full of action, holding the audience's attention. However, it's precisely in this moment that comes the factor that brings this movie down: the Ewoks, friendly and peaceful creatures, cuddly like teddy bears, which will be decisive in the final battle despite their weapons, rather than improvised, be the equivalent to that used for Humanity in prehistorical times. In fact, the simple interaction of the cast with these... animals, seems to have caused a great drop in the quality of their interpretation. These things are lovely, but they don't fit in the climax of an action/adventure film. It's like watching a Rambo movie and, in the middle of the final fight, the main character decides to become pacifist and supporter of the doctrine of nonviolence. Not to mention the end of the movie: it's ridiculous! I was expecting to see Bob Marley and marijuana being smoked there! This decidedly affected, by the negative, the quality of this film and make it disappointing to many fans.","FEB 22, 2018",6.0,sci-fi
The Faculty,"""Why are you naked?"" - Zeke Because what sexist film would be complete with a completely naked girl being the source of all of this mayhem and chaos at this school? How could a woman not be to blame for all that has occurred in The Faculty? It is really only the natural progression for a film that asks us to identify with Casey (Elijah Wood). A dorky kid who is constantly bullied, Casey is the classic underdog hero in film and despite obvious character flaws such as sniffing Delilah (Jordana Brewster) while hiding in the closet and despite creepily having a shrine dedicated to Delilah (okay, Jordana Brewster is attractive, but Jesus that is not anywhere near a free pass for being a 100% creep). I am not one to sit here and criticize how sexist a film is, but I feel is truly that obvious in The Faculty, which is a shame. With sexism as its main argument against, The Faculty comes armed to the teeth to appeal to kids who were marginalized (read: boys who were not popular in high school) by having Casey be bullied, pine after the hottest girl in school, have parents who cannot give two **** about him, not be athletic, and be a complete loner not just save the school, but also manage to scoop up the girl of his dreams in the process. Written like a wet dream, The Faculty is a creepy film that continues to dehumanize women in its treatment of women throughout. Not just Delilah and Marybeth are marginalized, but girls are all frequently called **** and shown to be quite **** and aggressive **** You Girl"" and Ms. Burke, in particular). Additionally, when Professor Furlong (surprise appearance from Jon Stewart) hits on Nurse Harper (another shock appearance from Salma Hayek) in a creepy manner, we are left to sympathize with him because how could anybody ever turn down such Oh and, lest we forget, the demonization of the unseen wife of Mr. Tate (Daniel van Bargen). In spite of his alcoholism, somehow she is the evil one for leaving him for somebody else. God forbid. Other than latent and prevalent sexism, The Faculty is faulty in many other ways as well, if you are left unswayed. I can deal with a wildly unoriginal film, but this one is truly revolutionary in this regard. References to prior science fiction films does not get you off the hook for ripping them at every chance you get. It honestly felt as though ever line mentioned a different film and how it is possible that the events of this one were going to follow the same line. I love the Amazon Prime X-Ray feature, which shows you goofs, trivia, continuity errors, cast on screen, and other little tidbits about a film while you are watching it. For The Faculty, I was floored. Practically every shot had some tidbit about how it referenced a film. Some shots had multiple films. Truly impressive level of copying. I get the sense that if Robert Rodriguez had to use Turnitin for this film, it would come up with 0% originality. Now, there are a few positives. In spite of these concerns, it is quite a fun film. I was certainly entertained by the film and I am sure many who can overlook my aforementioned problems will enjoy The Faculty. Rodriguez's films certainly always have flair to them and this one is no exception. A fast paced thrill ride, The Faculty may be unoriginal, but it does ape many of the better qualities of past films and is filled with camaraderie, high school hijinx/personalities, thrills, and teenage angst classic rock hits that many would request of a science fiction/horror film set in a high school. These overtures on the part of the film are, admittedly, hard to resist. It hits all the right notes with its plot and the return is pure enjoyment. Additionally, Rodriguez has great attention to detail that clues you into characters or are simply quality jokes. From Zeke (Josh Hartnett) having ""USA **** Big Time"" in his locker to a car supporting the Herrington High School Hornets having ""Me So Hornet' written on it, there are some subtle jokes along the way. The film also showcases attention to detail in delivering thrills by having a banner hanging in the gym the reads ""Feel the sting"" as the monster corners Casey. These details were not lost on me as a viewer and were among the reasons why I was so disheartened that it opted to be so unoriginal and sexist in its plot and characterization, respectively. A fun and detailed film from director Robert Rodriguez, The Faculty has a solid cast filled with recognizable faces, plus Josh Hartnett with significant bedhead. That said, despite its boyish charms, the film is overtly sexist and as unoriginal as they come, thanks to familiar plotting, characters, and references. The film often feels as if Robert Rodriguez had just caught up with all of John Hughes' 1980s teen comedies, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Thing, all films by Steven Spielberg, and all of Stephen King's books before opting to just smash them into one film.","SEP 26, 2016",4.0,sci-fi
Cloud Atlas,"Cloud Atlas is a hot mess. There is about **** movie here. The themes presented are relevant: love, dignity, freedom. Unfortunately they are sometimes presented in such a way as to seem trite or even cliched. There are also some strange and baffling elements that just don't work. I'm also going to get this out of the way right now: I was not a fan of the use of yellowface and whiteface on non-Asian and non-Caucasian actors, but not for the politically correct reasons a lot of people were. I didn't feel that the characterizations were racist or offensive. My main problem was that with a few exceptions, it looked really unconvincing. Of the six stories, I was most fond of the tale of Sonmi-451 (Neo Seoul, 2144). Her story was dark and tragic yet hopeful at the same time. The world she inhabits is a glitzy dystopia built upon the worst excesses of contemporary corporate culture. Of all the sequences, this one and the story of Robert Frobisher (Cambridge and Edinburgh, 1936) would have made enjoyable full-length films in their own right. I liked the sequence set in the UK, 2012, starring Jim Broadbent as Timothy Cavendish in what was essentially a dark comedy vignette about an aging publisher and his gangster client (Tom Hanks). Even a throwaway joke about soylent green being people actually relates to a disturbing element in the Neo Seoul sequence. The story set in the South Pacific in 1849 about a young lawyer who falls sick during a voyage and is under the care of a doctor who it emerges is poisoning him in order to steal his belongings but is saved by a runaway slave fell flat. Tom Hanks as Doctor Goose had a false nose and prosthetic buck teeth which made him look like a character from League of Gentlemen (the British comedy series, not the crappy adaptation **** Alan Moore comic book). Predictably the lawyer, who is helping the slave by hiding him and then later gets him work as a sailor on the ship, become friends. When the lawyer returns home he declares to his slave-owning father-in-law that he and his wife will go east to aid with the abolition efforts. It should be powerful but it just feels cliched and somewhat cheesy. I don't have too much to say about the sequence in which Halle Berry plays the main role. It was neither good nor bad and felt like an homage to movies of the era in which it was set, namely the early 1970s, featuring a tough, independent black journalist whistle-blower uncovering a conspiracy at a nuclear power plant run by an unscrupulous business man. Taken on its own, it could have made a rather average thriller with a few good moments of tension. The sequence set on a post-apocalyptic Hawaii in the year 2321, just stank. It reminded me of Battlefield Earth, but with better production values and no use of dutch angles that I can remember. Tom Hanks plays a superstitious coward belonging to a tribe of people with vaguely Maori-like tattoos on their faces. He is plagued by hallucinations of Hugo Weaving as a character that can best be described as a goblin with a top hat, who I think is supposed to represent his fear and religious hang-ups. Tom Hanks' people live in constant fear of cannibals on horseback with fearsome facepaint. Halle Berry plays a character from some nice,shiny utopia where they have pretty, shiny vehicles and fusion power. She's on the island looking for some ancient secret which she tells Tom Hanks is ""The true true."" or some such childish baby-talk. It's all very confusing and stupid and ends with Tom Hanks and Halle Berry living happily ever after on some distant planet with two dozen grandchildren sitting around a campfire listening to Grampy Tom Hanks tell stories. I haven't read the book, so I can't really compare it the source material. The principal cast appears throughout the movie in multiple roles because they're reincarnations of characters from earlier time periods, but it's not presented in chronological order. Some of it is intriguing. Some of it is hard to care about. Other parts are just plain weird and not always in a good or compelling way.","APR 3, 2013",6.0,sci-fi

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,"Drink the Kool-Aid. Wear blinders. Cover your ears. Because that's the only way you can totally enjoy Revenge of the Sith — the final and most futile attempt from skilled producer, clumsy director and tin-eared writer George Lucas to create a prequel trilogy to match the myth-making spirit of the original Wars saga he unleashed twenty-eight years ago. Fan boys, of course, have convinced themselves otherwise. So have several critics, if you go by early reviews. Heralded for its savagery (my God, it's rated PG-13), the film follows Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen — to merely call him wooden is an affront to puppets everywhere) as he loses his limbs and his conscience and takes on the evil mantle of Darth Vader. But thematic darkness is no excuse for dimness in all other departments, except the visual. In this heretic's opinion, Sith is a stiff, brought down by that special knack Lucas has of turning flesh-and-blood actors into cardboard cutouts. To hear Anakin and his pregnant wife, Senator Padme (the vivacious Natalie Portman rendered vacant), discuss their marriage — a secret that could get Anakin defrocked as a Jedi — is to redefine stilted for a new millennium. The minute any character — human or droid — opens a mouth to speak, your eyes glaze over. I kept thinking how much better Sith would play as a silent film, with only Chewbacca allowed to do his Wookiee growl and John Williams to trumpet his recycled **** yet, Revenge of the Sith is the movie that will do more business (my guess is $400 million-plus), sell more popcorn and brainwash more audiences than any blockbuster this summer. There are reasons: Sith is the last time Lucas will ever skywalk with the Skywalkers on the big screen (talk persists of a TV spinoff). There is enormous goodwill built up by the original series Lucas began in 1977 with Wars: A New Hope, continued in 1980 with The Empire Strikes Back and ended in 1983 with Return of the Jedi. All three of those movies belong in my personal time capsule, despite the Ewok blight on the last one. That's why you, me and everyone we know lined up for 1999's juvenile The Phantom Menace and 2002's atrocious Attack of the Clones. We watched with stifled yawns as Anakin grew from a snot-nosed kid (Jake Lloyd) to a whiny teen lover boy and wanna-be Jedi (Christensen). We justified the thudding lifelessness (a pox on those Jedi councils) by praising Lucas' digital artistry and nurturing the hope that Revenge of the Sith would spin our heads around with the dark magic of Darth Vader. Not even close. Until the last half-hour, when Lucas actually does establish a emotional connection between the landmark he created in 1977 and the prequel investment portfolio he laid out in 1999, the movie is one spectacularly designed letdown after another. Chief culprit? The script. Even with a reported polish by — say it isn't so — British playwright Tom Stoppard, the words are leaden, faux literate, mock-Shakespearean and devoid of humor. The late critic Pauline Kael once dismissed Wars as ""an epic without a dream."" I disagree. Lucas' dream is a grand one: to build a mythic futuristic fantasy out of the influences of his youth — the Bible, the Bard, H.G. Wells, Jack London, John Ford westerns, Flash Gordon serials and long afternoons at the movies. If only for the original Wars, Lucas deserves a place in film history. He transformed pop culture into Pop Art.ucas' major error was believing he could do it all alone. With Empire — now officially the best of the Wars six — Lucas had the invaluable help of screenwriters Lawrence Kasdan (Raiders of the Lost Ark) and Leigh Brackett (The Big Sleep), and director Irvin Kershner, who knew how to loosen up actors. For those who wrongly criticized Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford back when, all I can say is, look and weep. As for the good stuff, none of it involves human speech. There's Obi-Wan taking on the droid general, Grievous, whose metal arms can swing four light-sabers. There's the massacre of the Jedi when Palpatine calls for Order 66. There's Palpatine taking on Yoda (again voiced by Frank Oz), whom he contemptuously calls my ""little green friend."" ucas almost pulls the plot out of the fire in the film's final section, showing Obi-Wan hacking away at Anakin with his light-saber on the lava planet of Mustafar. Lucas even drops a hint that Anakin thinks Padme and Obi-Wan may have been getting it on. As we watch Anakin nearly melt in the lava, only to be put together, Frankenstein style, in a lab while Lucas intercuts scenes of Padme giving birth to the twins Luke and Leia, a link to genuine feeling is established at last. t's too little and too late. To hail Revenge of the Sith as a satisfying bridge to a classic is not just playing a game of the Emperor's New Clothes, it's an insult to what the original accomplished. To paraphrase Padme: This is how truth dies — to thunderous applause.","JAN 4, 2016",5.0,sci-fi
Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"Better than the first one for sure. I think Captain America rose up to his stage and became who the comics intended him to be for the most part in this one. It was a well structured plot that kept you awake and guessing. If not the plot, there were a few females with decent screen time to drool over so that works too. It delivered simply a solid movie about a super hero that isn't all flash (no pun intended) and gloss. Hard to do these days. A usable plot coupled with moral dilemma was a good angle. I'm not majorly impressed with the acting or the scale of the movie though. Wouldn't a problem this big like probably get some of the other Avengers involved? The more important ones? Just sayin.

Men in Black,"Comedy with disgusting scenes: not recommended for those who ate popcorn. In this comedy sci-fi movie we went into the parallel world of the MIB, special agents that regulate and supervise the entry, stay and exit of aliens on our planet, ensuring that we, humans, never know about it. For this, we follow the early career of Jay (Will Smith again fraternizing with extraterrestrials after ""Independence Day""), alongside his senior partner, Kay (Tommy Lee Jones, whom we never see a smile) in an effort to rid the world of a kind of giant cockroach, very upset with humans. The film is an adaptation of the comics by Lowell Cunningham and can largely satisfy those who read it. Its directed by Barry Sonnenfeld (who has made other comedies starring Will Smith, as ""Wild, Wild West"") and has Ed Solomon's script. The two protagonists were well up to the challenge and their interpretations were great, with perfectly memorable comic situations. Of course, being a humorous movie, no one expected to see psychologically complex characters but, nevertheless, Jones achieved this effect by showing the most dreamer and something unfortunate side of his character, which was a positive bonus in this film. The correlation between the two actors also looks very good, which helped in the interpretation of their characters. Two equally unforgettable characters are Frank, the talking pug (voiced by Tim Blaney) and the Worm Guys, which arise at some point and are recurring in the comics. The visual and special effects were very well and were effective but didn't wondered or surprised. However, the special effects aren't enough to make a movie. They aren't the movie, right? Less good points? There are few, less relevant, so we can go over them. The most important or worthy of contraindication may be the existence of some repulsive scenes, with crawling insects, viscous liquids, saliva and things like that bathing the protagonists and, surely, causing vomits in some more suggestible viewers.

Ultimately, this one felt like an origin story for a superhero, so though I almost always against sequels, I am surprised one never arose from this film. Ultimately, this one was alright throughout and was well directed by M. Night Shyamalan, but it was never truly great. The pieces came together interestingly and I was enjoying it enough to give it a better rating, but then the twist ending came and I really started to not like this one. The ending is horrendous and compared to The Sixth Sense where the ending was really quite good, this one just felt forced and stupid. More than that, it felt more far fetched than the whole original premise itself. Really, this one stands as evidence of Shyamalan's eventual demise, as though it is well put together, the unnecessary twist undoes all that was good about the film prior to it.

Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,"encourages the enraging behavior.. Star Trek : The Wrath Of Khan The primary reason why the feature is still loved and buzzed for, is that it ages well and the scrutiny in here focuses more on the simplicity of the emotion that is revenge, and keeps it more humane going man-to-man and street methods; it is more grounded. It is short on technical aspects like visual effects, sound department, production design, costume design and editing. The script has a lot of crispness in it to make it to screen and offer the audience the essential cinematic experience but what it lacks is enough concrete material to feed the audience for its almost two hours. Nicholas Meyers; the screenwriter-director, has got the appropriate vision and even though he fails to execute it as anticipated, the impact makes it worth the effort and time in here. The performance is plausible in here especially by the newer member Khan played by Ricardo Monatalbam and stayed true to their return roles by William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy and Deforest Kelly as a supporting cast.

Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"Improving on live action stunts and using a more contemporary plot, Captain America: The Winter Soldiers is a better movie than its prequel, although it's somewhat dry in humor. The movie is what one might expect in a superhero flick, great explosive action scenes, and perhaps more with its spy thriller aspect. However, the chemistry between characters isn't maximized, the humor is severely lacking and with a social commentary element of national security, the movie could've done more instead of resorting to unenterprising conclusion. The plot revolves around espionage, a modern subject which strings together conspiracy theory and relatable cause. This gives the original comic identity a fitting rejuvenation of modern day interpretation, but it lacks depth and only scratches the surface of the issue. Enemy of the State from more than a decade ago did a better, more harrowing portrayal of information surveillance. The movie is also vexed by several action movie flaws, such as characters conveniently meet or flee in certain scenes, quizzical plot device and a rather cliché use of indoctrination. Chris Evans plays the role of Captain America / Steve Rogers pretty well. He's not a simple minded patriot rather a man given the position of hero and yet still has his doubts. The cast of Evans is a good choice, he looks suitable for the character without trying to be a superhero. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff delivers as the femme fatale, although this might be a restriction as well. There are some scenes where the character could be more genuine or emotional, but bravado remains a more prevalent trait. Anthony Mackie as Falcon / Sam Wilson does a proper job of creating a partner persona for Captain America. Even though he's still in sidekick role, the character as a veteran and counselor for others with PTSD can be developed further. He shows some compatibility with Captain America, plus the bond of soldiers is a good foundation. Samuel L. Jackson is undoubtedly charismatic as Nick Fury. There's an imposing and sly atmosphere he brought as the leader role. Despite the decent cast, they don't have much affinity. Evans and Johansson look awkward, granted their on-screen relationship isn't a romantic one, but it doesn't feel that they possess much sense of camaraderie. The jokes between characters just fail to entertain; they are written in mediocrity and delivered with the same level of lackluster nature. It tries to display more personal appeal or witty charm, but doesn't really excel in either. The stunts are definitely better than most superhero or action movies. Instead of relying too much on CG, the movie opts for faster more aggressive live action fight scenes. This is a great direction due to raw intensity it presents during the action; the way the Captain's shield is intriguing as well. It doesn't mean that it's short on CG spectacles as there are many mandatory shootouts and explosions throughout the movie, and they are also appropriately translated to 3D, the computer generated effects are simply used in moderation effectively. Captain America: The Winter brings great solid cast and mix of action and CG, but cautious delivery of espionage premise, persistent flaw of plausibility and shortage of humor make the movie rather uninspiring.","APR 6, 2014",6.0,sci-fi
"I, Robot","The highest point of the film is undoubtedly the script. Balconies with super smart and well-constructed dialogue, the film shows the writers' job well done. And what scene is that one of the blink at the end? Genial. Will Smith's character takes a lot to be charismatic. In the first 30 minutes I started to say that was such a big mistake to choose him as the protagonist of the film. I was wrong, he shows his past and his psychological construction gets well structured. Charismatic yes, but could be better. I, Robot is one of the best movies set in the future. Chicago of 2035 was extremely realistic, though. Moreover, another defect of the film is the merchandising. How did Converse pay for that exhibition of All-Star? And the Audi logo appearing all the time? To me it doesn't seem coincidental that the main robot is named Sonny. Even with two N's, it is worth remembering that in U.S. the name is only pronounced, not written. It may sound conspiracy theory, but I found relevant.

Cloud Atlas,"I was so excited to see this film and i ended up being pretty disappointed. I think it was a good idea but executed entirely wrong. I will give a nod to the actors, it was not their performance that ruined it for me but the storyline was just plain confusing. It kept jumping from era to era and with the same actors playing mainly different roles I had trouble remembering what story I was in. I would suggest seeing it but prepare to be fully confused for the 20 minutes and then slightly confused for the rest. I think it takes a certain kind of person to like this movie. It just wasn't my cup of tea.","NOV 27, 2012",4.0,sci-fi
Cloud Atlas,"As if Speed Racer wasn’t enough, the Wachowskis were able to convince Warner to fork over hundreds of millions of dollars to embark upon the mission of Cloud Atlas, an impossibly ambitious adaptation of David Mitchell’s novel that spans space, time, and all varieties of viewer patience. Any film that focuses on cyborgs and spacecraft will appeal to a certain sci-fi demographic, but Cloud Atlas is ironically enough all over the map, just as interested in secret early 20th century **** affairs as it is in robotic ethics. It’s fascinating to watch simply because the Wachowskis (along with co-director Tom Tykwer) swing so wide they can’t possibly pull it off. Enlisting A-listers like Tom Hanks and Halle Berry to play multiple parts some of which involve Cro-Magnon growling and grunting and putting their effects team to work with gusto, Cloud Atlas quickly becomes fascinatingly big for its britches. This is kitchen-sink filmmaking at its most audacious: it can’t be argued that Cloud Atlas goes out of its way to do everything it can to connect with those tolerant enough to stomach it. There are cavemen and Farrah Fawcett-Majors haircuts, futuristic automatons with delusions of grandeur, gruff musicians and the suicidal boys who love them, airplane explosions, ultra-vivid car crashes again, Cloud Atlas has a lot of dramatic real estate to offer. Yet while its vastly ambitious intentions of representing the implicit entropy of the universe are uniquely inventive, the whole thing feels like an expensive, convoluted mess. But sometimes grandiose missteps like Cloud Atlas end up being ingenious time wasters. On Blu-ray, experiencing the Wachowski/Tykwer vision frequently prompts viewers to ask themselves, ‘Who green-lit this?’ Any movie with Tom Hanks’ name above the title is bound to sell a ticket or two, but fantasizing about Warner brass seeing the final print of this kaleidoscopic rubbish is too delicious to resist. Let’s leave it at this: Cloud Atlas is a mess, but few movies from 2012 were this jaw-droppingly stupefying.","MAY 18, 2013",4.0,sci-fi
Brazil,"This is like a weird dystopian nightmare - less V for Vendetta and more 1984-ish, with a heavy emphasis on 'Big Brother' and government ministries. I knew it'd likely be a bit weird but it really is rather bonkers and there's not much context or information provided to the viewer as it goes on - we have to guess things as and when. I recognised a number of well known comedian/actors, including Bob Hoskins, Gorden Kaye, Michael Palin and of course Robert DeNiro. There is some witty dialogue present but its not what I'd call a particularly accessible film - its very quirky and surreal with a weighty feel to it, so you have to be in the right sort of mood for it I suppose. It's very much a film about corporate and indeed government based bureaucracy. It's quite dark in terms of the themes covered and the visual look of the film - most settings are in barely lit dark rooms. I suppose it does well at putting an oppresive feel across. I did laugh a bit at the scenes depicting a worker or manager being hounded by a gang of other workers asking him questions, as he rushed down a long, long hall, reminiscent of MPs being hounded by the press I suppose (not that I feel sorry for them most of the time), due to the upbeat music played during these sequences. There's an element of riddle present in some of whats said and given this film dates from the mid 1980s, its visually somewhat dated, a little like Blade Runner, only without the flying cars obviously. This is quite a niche sort of a film - not one that will likely appeal to too many people, certainly on first watch. I wouldn't really recommend this as such, as I don't think its the kind of film that will appeal to many unless your really in the mood for something off-centre.","SEP 30, 2022",6.0,sci-fi
Sparks,"A superhero noir! I don't know where to begin, but the film kicked off with the heavy influence of 'Kick-Ass' and 'Sin City'. But the actual film was based on the graphic novel. Though the overall film looks so different, mainly because of the characters. The story was not anything extraordinary, not event the stunts which very essential for a theme like this. I don't know what the budget was, but looks like it made with a tight financial circumstance. The quality was acceptable, even though falls short to entertain us. It was not high-end superhero film, Kind of a superhero noir. The costumes were not fancy enough to attract. I think the actors were not bad, only their roles were. Written, produced and directed by some unknown B movie filmmaker who also the brain of the original graphic novel. He had a decent source, but the modern superhero films need those magical touch of twists and turns where this in lacked thoroughly. Seeing the reviews and ratings, it looks like some people liked it, but don't get deceived by that.

Equilibrium,"I have mixed feelings on this one. On one hand, the action is superb and the story is reminiscent enough of dystopian classics while still maintaining enough original elements to make for an interesting premise and maintain this interest throughout the movie. On the other, writer/director Kurt Wimmer isn't particularly known for subtlety and intelligence in his films, which a movie like this most certainly requires in order to be successful. The story, a mashup of elements derived from other, bigger, and better films like Fahrenheit 451, 1984, and Brave New World, follows John Preston, a high-ranking member of a secret police force established in humanity's last bastion following World War 3 and tasked with eliminating any and all items that invoke human emotion, as well as executing ""Sense Offenders"" who fail to take the emotion-blocking drug Prozium. Yes, rather than books or knowledge deemed dangerous by the ruling party in other similar works, humanity's problems are this time blamed upon our ability to feel, particularly rage and anger, but anything that invokes any emotion whatsoever is labeled for destruction--music, paintings, literature, you name it. The concept is interesting: without emotion someone is typically considered a sociopath/psychopath, and yet crime and violence are completely eradicated in the city-state of Libria (aside from the ""necessary"" execution of Sense Offenders in the Nether region beyond the city and in the giant furnaces beneath the streets). But rather than delving deeper into the societal implications of this, Wimmer instead settles for a disappointingly normal saga about Preston and what begins to happen to him when he accidentally misses a dose of Prozium before devolving further into a ""rebellion versus evil government who seeks out the help of an ex-bad guy"" plot. Typical. The cast is both a strength and a weakness. One great thing about this movie is that it brings out the best in Sean Bean, who as Preston's original partner Errol Partridge brings real emotion, conviction, and humanity to his brief appearances in the movie, remorseful for having served the government in pursuit of a misguided quest to rob mankind of what makes us human, before quoting Yeats poetry and taking a bullet to the neck in an abandoned church in typical Sean Bean fashion, though we're sad to see him go. He would have undoubtedly made a more interesting protagonist than Preston (portrayed by Christian Bale), who, aside from the moments in which he experiences flashes of emotion that cause breakdowns on the spot, is not terribly convincing or interesting. Wimmer doesn't try at all to make him likable nor does he give us much reason to care for him, as he shoots his best friend early on in the movie and was present at his wife's execution despite having fought to prevent the police from taking her when they raided his house. His speech is very monotone (if and when he does speak), and his main purpose in the movie appears to be to shoot people. Though that's more, I suppose, than Emily Watson's Mary O'Brien character was allowed to do, as after her arrest all she did was sit in an interrogation room and wait for Preston to come back and say something to her. And one other thing, though I won't spoil that. Taye Diggs, for a man without emotion, sure puts a lot more into his performance than Bale does, smiling and occasionally cracking jokes while still capable of being ruthless when it is demanded of him (though he's not exactly the greatest fighter without an armed strike team to back him up). The two standouts in this movie are Bean, because we wish we could have seen more of him, and Diggs, who is appropriately devious in his role as a secondary antagonist. One superb element of the movie is the action sequences, especially the gun kata utilized by the Grammaton Clerics that puts even John Woo's signature gun fu style to shame. The difference here is that while other forms of the art usually rely on pure reflex, Wimmer's style is more scientific, allowing the wielder, through analysis of recorded gunfights, to predict the angles of enemy fire and adjust their own fire to inflict the maximum amount of damage on opponents while suffering a minimal amount themselves. The gunplay in the film is fast, unrelenting, and brutal, and it looks cool as hell, beating out even ""The Matrix"" and ""Desperado"". As I stated above, there are things that I like about this movie, and things that I don't. Is it entertaining? Sure. Does it make a statement about humanity and society, and the direction we're headed? To an extent. But if you're looking for a meatier, more philosophical look on a less undesirable trait of our species, go watch one of the more classic dystopian movies rather than this one. Still, on a slow Saturday night, this will offer a fun and usually engaging ride, provided you don't read too much into it. 6/10","AUG 10, 2016",6.0,sci-fi

Cloud Atlas,"A confusing morass of six story lines and a seventh that serves as epilogue and prologue--this film gives new meaning to the question, “What just happened?” A cast of eloquent and well-known actors plays multiple roles where in some cases they are virtually unrecognizable. The most outrageous include Hugh Grant as a tribal chieftain who is a confirmed cannibal, and Tom Hanks as a murderous physician from 1849 as well as a frustrated and equally murderous 2012 book author who kills his harshest critic at a party by throwing the arrogant and presumptuous cad over the balcony. Hanks is also a father figure in a primitive clan in 2346 Hawaii, although there he is highly recognizable, even though he is speaking a barely comprehensible pigeon English that can only be described as Hillbilly Jive. (To say “that's the truth” is “that's the true-true.”) Strangely enough, Hanks lapses into standard English in a few instances where he has to explain an important plot point. Subtitles would have been beneficial. The film changes geographical locations and time periods, as it ricochets between 1) 1849 South Pacific; 2) 1936 Scotland; 3) 1973 San Francisco; 4) 2012 Great Britain where actor Jim Broadbent is kept prisoner in a nursing home; 5) 2144 Neo Seoul (somewhere around old Seoul); 6) 2346 Hawaii; and 7) the frame story provided by the prologue and epilogue taking place about 30-40 years after 2346 Hawaii on a planet colonized by humans. Presumably the movie is about people finding their true inner selves, setting off on the path of that which is good, true and beautiful, and establishing a humanistic, worldwide faith where a divinity does not figure into it, except in the primitive society in 2346 Hawaii, where they falsely worship the little Korean girl from 2144 Neo Seoul, a clone who fought bravely against corporate consumer predators, and who was part of a workforce consisting of an army of clones, robotlike employees who worked 19-hour days for a certain amount of time, and were then murdered, recycled and fed back to the other clones as a protein drink, the only nourishment they were allowed. The resistance army for which the clone was a kind of Joan of Arc was called The Union. The clone, played by Korean actress Doona Bae, is the connective thread, while Halle Berry and Tom Hanks also provide secondary connective threads, to the extent that anything really connects in this movie. The philosophy of the film seems to be about incarnation and reincarnation, and how we are all a part of something much larger than ourselves, somehow reaching out to ancestors and descendents, on some subliminal level of consciousness that connects everyone and everything to everything else, and that has to do with the stars and outer space, with no mention of God, apparently because there are too many atheists who go to movie theaters. A noble effort that somehow went awry with too much **** philosophy and too much amateurish make-up.","JUN 8, 2013",5.0,sci-fi

Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"Mediocre, action-based movie. I feel like Marvel is on its way down. This movie was not at all what it was promised to be. It seems more and more like Chris Evans was only casted for his looks. The character Steve Rogers is boring and one-dimensional - the few ""emotional"" moments present aren't written in a believable manner. I personally enjoyed 'The Avengers' quite a lot and 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' doesn't live up to that standard. The dynamics between the actors/characters are superficial. Also I hate the fact that they've casted Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill - for me she's forever stuck as Robin Scherbatsky (How I Met Your Mother) and is in no way as badass as she should be. Still, I can't deny that the movie was entertaining. It was slow at times but acceptable. I really liked the supporting character 'Sam Wilson/Falcon'. He was witty and human as badass.

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,"RotS is a definite improvement over the first two prequels (well, it couldn't be as bad as the epically awful AotC), but it is still a monumental disappointment. The plot revolves around the finale of the Clone Wars, the destruction of the Jedi Order, Anakin Skywalker's reluctant embracing of the Dark Side of The Force, Obi-Wan and Yoda's forced exile, and the 'birth' of Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker and Leia Organa. The film ties up the relevant plot points adequately but, as a movie, it's just so incredibly lazily directed and ineptly written..... Throw in some (now expected) terrible acting, enough CGI to make you wonder why they bothered hiring any real actors at all, and it all comes together into a well organised mess. There are some good points.... But not many. Some of the actors in the film (notably Ewan McGregor, as Obi-Wan, and Natalie Portman, as Senator Amidala) are trying to rise above the unbelievably bad script, but are simply unable to. As I mentioned in my review for AotC it's almost as if George Lucas can't imagine any actor in his film(s) being able to express the emotions of their character, so he has to actually have them say what emotional state they're in. And it's so patronising as to be borderline offensive. Other bad things? Well, Hayden Christensen drags the movie down even more than he did in AotC, mainly because the central crux of the narrative (his 'turning' to the Dark Side) just becomes unintentionally hilarious. He isn't helped by very strange performance by Ian McDiarmid (as Palpatine/Darth Sideous) who turns the evil Sith Lord mastermind into an almost camp parody, with his vocal inflections and over the top mannerisms. Both Christopher Lee and Sam L. Jackson are both wasted, and the less said about the terrible CGI Yoda the better. Is there anything good? Not really.... The long awaited reveal of Darth Sideous is quite frankly lame, leading up to the duel between him and Mace Windu which is also very badly put together. Anakin's turn to the Dark Side is cemented with his revelation 'What have I done?'... A line delivered much better (and with a lot more class and conviction) by the 'original Obi-Wan actor Alec Guinness in Bridge on the River Kwai... And even the destruction of the Jedi, the real emotional set-piece of the movie is terrible... Jesus... Having some cute, chubby kid deliver the line 'Master Skywalker, there are too many of them' before we see Anakin's 'evil' yellow eyes (which makes no sense by the way), and the inference of Anakin killing all the 'Younglings', is just ineptly done.... I could simply go on, but I won't. The bottom line is that this film is awful but, because it's rounding off several story arcs, it has to include some narrative plot points (and some action scenes) that make it better (if that's a compliment) than the first two prequels....","JUN 30, 2016",4.0,sci-fi

The Butterfly Effect,"The movie starts off with all the events leading up to the main character Evan’s discovery that he can travel through time. At first, it was okay. It was pretty average, but not too unremarkable. Then it kept switching between different scenes and I started getting a bit confused. “Did the movie mean for it to seem random and sudden, or is it really just that bad?” After the meeting with Evan’s father and the scene where Tommy loses it at the cinema, I was laughing at how ridiculous and exaggerated the events were and how they just rushed those events by without ever stopping to think about how that’d affect anything. The interesting parts start when Evan reads journal entries he wrote when he was younger, and discovers that by reading them, he can travel back in time to when these blackouts occurred. That was fine, though it could have been better. The writing could have been more imaginative. Why is it that every time Evan saves Lenny, Lenny ends up as his roomate? Why is it that every time Evan saves Kayleigh, she ends up with him? Why is it that every time Evan saves Tommy, he ends up a nice religious guy? How could Evan’s empty threats stop Kayleigh and Tommy’s father from being a pedophile and abuser? Why didn’t Evan get charged with self defense in the first place? The movie tries to make their characters seem real and deep or whatever, but the script changes too fast and provides way too much mood whiplash that it ends up being confusing and frustrating. This contradictory writing is a great source of unintentional hilarity. The ending of the movie is something I can appreciate. It was probably the most well-written part in the entire movie, and certainly the only part I can’t find any glaring or aggravating problems about. All in all, the most I’d give this movie a 6/10. The hilarious way it goes about trying to be dramatic and meaningful keeps the movie from being unremarkable, but it’s still not simething I’d watch again nor recommend to others.","MAR 23, 2020",6.0,sci-fi
Edge of Tomorrow,"Edge of Tomorrow is directed by Doug Liman and stars Tom Cruise, Emily Blunt and Bill Paxton. The film revolves around the earth being invaded by deadly aliens and the human race being on the edge of extinction. The aliens are winning the war and we decide to make one last push on the beaches of France in a deadly battle that we lose and everything is lost. One of the things that the film tries to do is defy genre convention. It tries so hard avoiding the obvious cliché that comes with a script like this and it does it so well up until the last act, which is arguably the least satisfying conclusion to a film that I have seen in a long time. I wasn't originally going to be seeing this film in theatres but after hearing the praise it got from critics I started debating on whether to see this or X-Men but after receiving a free movie ticket I made the obvious choice of seeing Edge of Tomorrow. I mean, you can't turn down a free movie ticket! To make a long story short, I should have gone with X-Men. On the eve of the landing, Pvt. Bill Cage (Cruise) is sent to the front line and is killed within the first five minutes of battle. This first act is so well made and treated with such respect that the rest of the film just seems underwhelming compared to the thrilling ride of the first half. Before his death, Cage was infected with an alien gene that gave him the ability to relive the same day over and over again giving the movie a lot to work with as it has so much going for it. Unfortunately it could have been so much better. The best part is without a doubt some of the clever plotting that makes the time loop aspect of the film never seem predictable or boring. There was probably not a single moment during the first half that made me want to close my eyes and fall asleep. The second half however is a cheesy, badly paced action cliché, which is a shame. The acting was terrific, with Tom Cruise doing one of the most demanding roles of his career. Cruise's character was very complex and well thought out and I praise the writers for that. I love the fact that Tom Cruise commits himself to the action so much cause he really wants the audience to have a good time. Emily Blunt was so great in this film and I almost think that she should have been the star of the show with all her terrific action scenes. All of the actors did a really good job with their roles but what's sad is that there is almost no character development and Edge of Tomorrow suffers from that. Although the acting is great I didn't give a dime about any of the supporting characters making the film seem a little bland. Thankfully the first half mostly revolves around Cage so it doesn't hurt the overall experience to much. The cinematography was a hit and miss in this film. Sometimes the picture is just beautiful to look at with cool wide shots that hold the mediocre special effects whilst at other times the film feels like something a four year old with a camcorder could do better. It's annoying and distracts from the overall experience. I thought the soundtrack was all right and suited the film for what it is, a mediocre popcorn flick, filled with action clichés but redeems itself with an interesting main character, a plot that is all right for the most part and some cool battle scenes. If that is something you are looking for than go ahead, Edge of Tomorrow is your thing! However, if you want to see a film with a good consistent story, beautiful images throughout, good solid character development that sinks you right in and a satisfying end conclusion, you should rather go with X-Men: Days of Future Past.","JUN 6, 2014",5.0,sci-fi
Cloud Atlas,"This was certainly a rather....unique movie. I have neither read or heard of the book before, nor this I really know what the movie was going to be about. I was in for a mixed surprise. I really liked the concept of there being multiple stories within multiple time periods and the transitions between them are seamless. However (at least in the movie) these stories seem to be connected rather loosely. The only thing you get to see is how these individual stories are being transferred. (For example the first guy writes a diary which is read by someone in the next time period. That guy writes letters to his lover about his story and so on and so forth.) At first I though that if this is the only way these stories are connected, that's kind of lazy. But then came the credits in which you could see which actor played whom. This is probably the most revealing part of the movie, which now that i think about it is actually rather amusing. Still, i decided to do some research about the story to get some explanations about things that I might have missed. And so i found out that this movie was supposed to be about reincarnation throughout time periods. This makes sense after seeing the credits, but it's not really explained throughout a movie. As a movie, this kind of fails because important things that might have been explained better in the book are not really to be seen in this movie.

Edge of Tomorrow,"The accepted suspension of disbelief that goes hand in hand with the Sci-Fi genre is pushed to its limits in 'Edge of Tomorrow' which takes its theme from films with a similar concept like 'Groundhog Day' and 'Source Code, even if the story is quite different. Basically, in an effort to win a war against marauding aliens Tom Cruise has to re-live the same events every day until the required result is achieved. So far so good, and there is a lot to enjoy here especially in the first hour and the last final alien encounter. However, Sci-Fi or not, this is a story that does not stand up to too much close scrutiny as there are more holes in the plot than there are bullets flying through the air. To this end the editing style is at once both the film's saviour and ultimately its downfall. Given the necessary repetition of the story, and to ensure that we are not given the same scene time after time, jump cuts are made to propel events forward. Unfortunately, whilst this device works satisfactorily for most of the time there are also occasions when clarity is sacrificed. This subsequently leads one to question all sorts of things about what has or has not had to happen to get to a particular point in the story. The suspect ending is definitely a casualty of this technique and is maddeningly unsatisfactory. Still, the film is entertaining enough and both the visuals on the battlefield and those depicting a devastated Paris are extremely impressive.","JUN 5, 2014",5.0,sci-fi
Edge of Tomorrow,This is a very tough movie to grade because of the acting of its stars Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt whom are both outstanding; perhaps Emily a tad more. Why? Because only she seems to know what is really going on? We meet Tom as Major Cage an advertising officer who is immediately reassigned to fight on the front lines the very next day although he has absolutely no training at all. Why? We have no idea. And from there the plot goes haywire. If you ever saw the great movie Ground Hog Day starring Bill Murray welcome back. For the next half hour without any suspense whatsoever Tom is killed by the funny looking aliens and immediately comes back to life. By the 3rd time you are literally bored out of your mind. About the 6th time when the coward Tom becomes the bored hero Emily enters the film for real and tells him he can't die and only he can save the world against these not so scary aliens. Why they have invaded Earth we have no idea. Well from there the movie is as predictable as you don't need me to tell you what is going to happen. Major Cage knowing he can't die goes from weakling coward to Rambo. Other than the two stars acting there is absolutely zero character development. Tom is actually falling in love with Emily but even that never bears any fruit for the viewer to see. Bottom line is the teenage boys who like continuous shoot em up action movies without any intelligence will love this. Anyone who does not check their brain in at the door will find no redeeming quality whatsoever in this very poor movie. I should have known when I went to the first screening last night at 8 PM. The theater held 300 seats and only 4 of us came to see it. You can choose to believe the bought and paid for critics or listen to real moviegoers in which most of us telling the truth will rate this about a 4. Save your money to wait for free TV.

However, it contains many of the problems between the previous two films, such as the uninspiring characters and wooden dialogue.

Lilo & Stitch,"Uninspiring. This is the only word that can come to my mind when asked about the movie, as well as the only word that could describe this movie. Disney's 2002 blockbuster hit ""Lilo and Stitch"" is a movie that's primary focus was absolutely nothing more than style over substance. This is the best example of the famous phrase, ""Looks can be deceiving"". While the scenery, color, and animation was well done, this is were Lilo and Stitch's credentials come to a halt. While the plot was somewhat unoriginal, it had potential, but just couldn't deliver. A mutant named Experiment 626 comes to Earth from another planet and befriends an emotionally detached young girl, engaging in adventures together. In spite of this, Disney fails to deliver an interesting story, fails to give the viewer enjoyable and likeable characters, and fails to provide any sort of humor. Finally, the mutant itself, otherwise known as ""Stitch"". Intended to be the most likeable character, he is absolutely nothing more than an annoying, obnoxious, and disrespectful nuisance, whose true sole purpose was to be a waste of space for everyone else. In conclusion, while the animation was incredibly well done, ""Lilo and Stitch"" is nothing more than a waste of time and money. The only people who could enjoy this sort of movie are nuisances like Experiment 626 himself. 5/10","DEC 9, 2013",5.0,sci-fi

However, The Winter Soldier definitely surprised me with a relatively strong script with witty dialogue. It seems 'smarter' than the average Marvel movie. However, a major down-point was that not a single person was able to pull off a strong performance. Scarlett had an interesting character, but her acting was weak, so that really put me off a little. Well, Robert Redford certainly did not come across as evil to me, even towards the end. It was also quite obvious since the start that he was the villain, but perhaps Marvel meant for us to know that? As for **** usual he's just there for people to ogle. Overall, the soundtrack was weak and uninspiring; the biggest disappointment still stems from the big mismatch between a strong script and the actor's weak performances.","APR 3, 2014",6.0,sci-fi
Cloud Atlas,"I felt this was a complicated film - certainly the plot is many layers deep and I struggled to see the direct links between some of the elements but regardless of that, I felt it was a well made film as there are some quite stunning landscape shots, some decent cinematography (aerial camerawork) and special effects and I noticed some witty pieces of dialogue. Its somewhat thought provoking and features a decent cast (Tom Hanks, Jim Broadbent, Halle Berry, Hugh Grant etc.), its just a bit mind bending. I was aware it would be like this, as I knew its based on a very long novel but no doubt it would put some people off due to the complexity of the plot. It definitely has a strong philosophical sense or side to it, which appealed to me but the more sci-fi aspects didn't appeal to me so much, seeming far fetched and not as clearly connected to the rest of the main narrative. Some of the scenes reminded me slightly of Inception. I suppose the main theme of this film is the impact that an indviduals actions can have on others (including society as a whole perhaps) more precisely over time. I admit I'm not great at following everything precisely in such films but for the most part I certainly enjoyed this film and so I'd recommend it on that basis. Quotes include - ""my life lives far beyond the limitations of me' 'I understand now that boundaries between noise & sound are conventions. All boundaries are conventions, waiting to be transcended' from this you may be get a feel for why I say its a bit confusing (or perhaps 'deep' is a better, more applicable term). I wasn't surprised to read that the Wachowski's were involved as writers and directors (along with Tom Twyker as another director and writer and Chris Lindsay who wrote some additional material), as some of it reminded me of The Matrix I suppose with it being a complicated plot and, the sci-fi elements and CGI/special effects. It is the sort of film that may be worth repeated viewings but I'm not entirely convinced that everything would necessarily be made entirely clear on a second viewing alone - I think there is an element of unanswered questions deliberately left for the viewer to contemplate.","NOV 23, 2021",5.0,sci-fi

Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"I am such a huge fan of the first movie that I felt for sure that I would like this one as well, but I just could not get into it. It starts off really strong with a very cool action sequence aboard a ship at sea, but just when I think it's going to be one of the better Marvel films, it becomes almost a version some updated political spy thriller from the 1970s. Like the Osterman Weekend, if you will, with superheroes. Not that I am against a film having a story. But the story in this film kind of defies logic. I have read reviews about how great the character of the Winter Solider is, and how he is the best Marvel villain since Loki. I call bullsh#t on that, as the best Marvel villains, imho, are Loki at the top, followed by Doc Ock from Spider-Man 2 and Magneto from X-Men: First Class. Hell, I would go as far as saying even Sebastian Shaw from First Class was a better villain than Winter Soldier. Here is simply akin to the Terminator, showing up when he is called for and then laying waste to all around him. It doesn't require much acting for that, just a strong physical presence, which he does deliver. But no more than Kurst The Undying in Thor: Dark World, a much superior film to this. It had enough going for it that I didn't totally hate it, but at the same time, I expected a lot more from it. I don't blame the actors, as they are all good with the roles they play. I blame a mediocre script with some plot holes I just found difficult to believe. And I am usually way more forgiving than this. But, hey, that's just my opinion.

One problem though, this movie is a complete mess. It regularly jumps all over the place from the past to the future then to the past again that I can't think of any other thing to say but ""what the hell does this movie want to be?"" Every timeline has different themes to them. First and second story is drama movie, 3rd is suspense thriller, 4th is a comedy, the 5th and 6th story in the future is all action. The movie jumps back and forth between all the stories that it's just a complete mess. I tries to link them together by having the themes when it jumps similar, eg: a battle in the 6th jumps to a battle in the 3rd, but in all honesty it's completely unnecessary. The theme of the story is the first story leading to the next will influence the actions of each story's main characters, and that's it. It's better to just play it in order from the first to the last story like Animatrix or some other short movie compilations so it's easy to follow and fun to enjoy.

Even though this can be seen as a pro or a con, pretentious psuedointellectuals will love this film, basking in its non-revelatory metaphysical overtones. Also, the action sequences are more than likely going to feel drawn out (Nolan could have at least made the unveiling towards the climax 1/3 of how it was) - the reason that it was done the way it was is in due probably cause to the fact that Nolan wanted to make an epic film. Though there is something that this movie is and the best word I can use is that of a concept coined by the author Kurt Vonnegut: ""Cranfalloon."" A Cranfalloon is something that seems epic, bold, audacious or significant and yet, like a balloon, is filled solely with air. It's as if this film ""Inception"" should have really been called ""Deception,"" as in; we are deceived to believe that this jumble mess of ideas in which the number of possibilities for interpretations causes a negation of any one ""true"" interpretation. I don't regret watching it. The second time I watched it, though, I strongly desired having spent that time doing something else.","JUL 19, 2012",3.0,sci-fi

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,"While most fans call this movie the ""good prequel"", it's still just as much of a comical farce as the first two of them. The CGI may be a lot better here, but this film is still ruined by horrendous dialogue, headache-inducing action sequences, another terrible performance from Hayden Christiansen (and other characters, although his is still by far the worst) a manic, plot-hole-filled mess of a story that attempts to squeeze tons of failed character development into the film's second half, more worthless, unconvincing romance and tons of 2000s blockbuster movie clichés that are impossible to take seriously. The fact that this movie has so many fans and defenders is downright tragic; maybe in 2005 it might have been a nice surprise because it's more visually interesting than the first two, but it's aged so extremely badly to the point of being inexcusable.

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope,"Well, you have the film start with that really annoying and ponderous scroll up the screen. Not a fan of that. Then we're introduced to C3P0 and R2D2. Even way back at the tender age of 5 when I first saw the movie, I could sense that there was some sort of **** partnership going on between those two droids. Very uh, very dainty mannerisms. Of course, it was pissing me off that R2D2 just made a bunch of clips and beeps. Didn't find him cute at all, just indecipherable. What's up with that? Who needs a trashcan with some beeping noises? Then we get the firefight that has a bunch of stormtroopers running in and dying because their armor does absolutely **** all. Luckily, the Rebel guards have about the same level of marksmanship and no armor. Darth Vader comes in... he's not bad, he's kinda cool looking. But uh, then we get to Princess Leia. And ya know, I just don't find Carrie Fisher attractive. She's not a good looking woman. Not a fan of her. You kinda get the sense she's trying really hard to stay skinny by vomiting after meals or something. Annnd then we get the two droids walking around this barren desert and bickering at one another. I dunno... it just seemed really... boring and mundane. Not much of a crowd pleaser. It's also a very one sided conversation, since the little **** can only make beeps and clicks. **** him... I really thought it was good that he got tasered or whatnot. So yadda yadda yadda and... we finally come to the hero of the entire film... Luke ****ing Skywalker. Our protagonist, if you will. A little whiny farm boy. Oh my God I cannot stand Luke. Or maybe it's Mark Hamill. Maybe Mark Hamill was the problem, but I didn't like him. And this was before his face got all mangled up in ESB. Dude really resembled some sort of mongoloid then. But in ANH, he was just really whiny and annoying and hard to stomach. The way he would just stare at those two setting suns like he'd never seen them before in his ****ing life. You just didn't see why we should care about this guy, who whines about wanting to go join his friends at some academy. Or he's going to Toshi to get water vapor machines or something... it just doesn't inspire any sort of liking to this guy. Later on, we find out he also has a thing for his sister. What the ****. We meet Obi Wan Kenobi. Ridiculous name, of course. I can't see why anyone would think that's a name at all. Just **** But whatever. He rescues Luke from those sand people. Which was sad, cause I really wanted them to kill Luke and maybe eat his entrails? But no, we get treated to more of Mark Hamill's hammy ass acting as he acts surprised to learn more about his father. We see the first scene with the lightsaber, which looks awful of course, because this was the original version of the film I saw, back on VHS. No special edition with the CGI yet. So yea, it just looks kinda like a bright snow sword at times. We go to the town and find Han Solo. Han Solo... really **** and smarmy. Not as bad a character as Luke, but still not all that likeable. Plus, he hangs around with this walking bigfoot ripoff named Chewie, who again like R2D2 doesn't actually say anything we can understand. That's just annoying, sticking in characters that can't talk. Then again, this is from a guy who gave us great lines like ""I don't like sand. It's rough. Not like your skin, it's smooth. Not like sand."" Or something to that effect. The Force. Sooooooo ridiculous. Crazy mumble jumble. What is it, what does it do? I dunno, whatever George Lucas pulls outta his ass, apparently. New Age mysticism turned into a pithy little catchphrase in cinema. And that's the thing with Star Wars, it's not sci-fi, it's just sci-fantasy. A wizard did it, it doesn't have to make sense. Whatever, I hate fantasy. The Death Star. Oh god, the Death Star. Why would you build a ginormous battle station with this one vulnerability that allows the entire thing to blow up? That doesn't seem like a very good design. The shaft somehow goes straight into the main core. Of course it does. It's the size of a small moon but they couldn't be bothered to have the shaft deviate in some sort of manner. It just goes straight. And no filters in between. Nothing to stop a missile or torpedo.","SEP 27, 2011",1.0,sci-fi

Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,"It was worth a watch, that is the only good thing I'll say about it. Even then, only watch it when it's on T.V. and you have nothing better to do. **** is a better use of your time. The most disappointing aspect of the 3 prequels is the lack of artistic integrity. The original 3 were works of imagination, initiative, clever writing, and wonderful story telling with a hint of special effects. The 3 new Star Wars movies are only special effects mixed with bad acting and simple story telling. There were no surprise twists or turns in the story line, it was utterly predictable and uninteresting. Anakin (Hayden Christensen) seemed to be a completely week minded, morally confused, hormonal teen-age girl. Coupled with Haydens terrible acting, it was almost embarrassing to watch. I feel like he got an acting certificate from a community college, or more accurate, Lucas pulled the first semi-decent looking man off the street with no previous acting experience and threw him in as the man who turned into Darth Vader. The Jedi were laughably powerful in some aspects and the actual power of the force was laughably feeble. Light saber duels were overly complicated and literally just a dance with pretty lights. So many questions that this movie doesn't answer and so many questions it raises. Why can Yoda move amazingly dextrous when fighting, yet so crotchety anywhere else? Why, with a council of 10 or so JEDI MASTERS not see this coming when I, a simple watcher of events, knew what was coming, even had I not watched the first films? Why, devoting his ENTIRE life to the Jedi order, did Anakin decide to turn against it with little more than 2 conversations with the emperor? Why was master Windu able to defeat Darth Citius(?) so easily yet Yoda, seemingly the Jedi leader, fall so easily to him? Why would you move to a lava filled, dangerous mining facility with magma splashing around to sword fight? Why is it that NOT ONE person said 'Hey, killing all the Jedi seems wrong.'? Why would the Jedi council put Anakin in charge of watching the emperor if he was obviously close and friendly with him, knowing that he was wildly impressionable? These are just a few of the questions that either needed to not be asked or could have been answered with some basic story telling. The Emperor has been working for YEARS building his power, planning out his take over, conserving his power, yet the plan was laughably feeble and relied far too heavily on events that were, in all realistically, EXTREMELY unlikely to happen. So many holes in the plot and unrealistic events. Bottom line, this movie seemed to be written by 14 year old boys saying ""You know what would be cool? um... um... um... if they had a sword fight on lava! Or if um... all the clones were actually really mean instead of the valiant army of level headed clones!"" The acting... oh the acting. Natalie Portman, with her disturbing attempt at loving and crying. Hayden was overly dramatic and switched from a dark, twisted lord to a lovey dovey husband and future father, both grossly different emotions for one character. There should have been come carry over but it was a terrible switch in roles. The only decent actor Ewan McGregor. Even Samuel L. Jacksons acting seemed forced. Its as if they did one take for every scene and said ""Good enough!"" and left it at that.

Cloud Atlas,"Cloud Atlas is attempting to be an intellectual film, and had the storytelling devices been different, maybe it would have succeeded. Unfortunately, the movie was too long, too badly cut, to create a coherent whole. The main issue I have with the film is the fact that before any of the storylines can really get going, the movie cuts to a different storyline altogether. Every time I thought I might start getting interested, all the momentum and tension the scene had going for it would be dispersed when once again I was treated to another section. It didn't help that at times, the six different storylines didn't feel stylistically linked. The three chronologically earliest pieces have a serious tone and seem very grounded in reality; then we have the nursing home bit, which is far too comedic to match with any of the other pieces; finally there are the two futuristic sci-fi ones, which once again feel like a departure from the earlier, more ""realistic"" settings. And all the explosions felt out of place--Cloud Atlas is not, after all, supposed to be a summer-blockbuster action thriller. And yet despite all the attempts to add tension, the movie is just flat out boring because of the horrible pacing. There were several moments when I thought for sure the movie would be over, but no, it continued for another hour.

Cloud Atlas,"A rather major (though not entire) misfire. The ostensible reason for switching back and forth among stories is that viewers could not follow the presentation in David Mitchell's original book where the stories are suspended in the middle and picked up hundreds of pages later, as well as to develop the ""transmigration of souls"" theme (which is also reinforced by the casting of the same actors in all six stories). The problem with this approach (apart from the fact that the reincarnation idea is neither essential nor clearly developed in the book) is that the integrity or coherence (and hence effectiveness) of each of the stories is sacrificed in the process. It's hard for me to believe that anyone who has not read the book could possibly follow each of the stories as presented in the movie.( the stories could have been presented in serial order without interruption, or in an interconnected way that was perfected by, say, Robert Altman.) But over and beyond this, the degree to which each story is fractured and the speed with which the directors move back and forth among stories is completely unnecessary for their cinematic conceit.. In addition, much of the storytelling here, unlike Mitchell's book, is almost cartoonish in its exaggeration; and the Wachowkis' turning of the Somni-451 story into a Matrix/Star Wars epic is totally unforgivable for anyone who claims to have an appreciation of the novel. (The Somni-451 and the post-apocalyptic Hawaii stories are, admittedly, the weakest part of that novel--which is itself a bit overrated, in my opinion--but they certainly deserve a better translation than they receive here.) The attraction of Cloud Atlas as a novel is the way in which Mitchell presents six different stories in six different literary styles recalling or imitating six different literary genres. This feature is completely (and unnecessarily) obscured by the movie. What an expensive shame!","DEC 8, 2012",3.0,sci-fi

But my god, I was not expecting such a hilariously unwatchable disaster. It's not the bad special fx, or even the somewhat dated feel of the movie... Superman II's biggest problem is it's actors delivery and total lack of subtlety in their performance. Some of it can surely be blamed on the director for accepting the takes, but a lot of the lines are delivered so unbelievably bad you wonder how they made it past the cutting room floor. The story isn't much better, just an excuse to have an all out brawl in the middle of the city... you can see where directors like Michael Bay major influences are.

Superman II,"After the success of the first film, a sequel was predictable. However, I can't say it's as good or impressive as the first movie. In fact, if the first one seems old to me, this film looks even more dated and there is no doubt that it has fallen into complete oblivion. The script follows the story of the first film and reveals how Lois comes to know the identity of Clark Kent, with whom she begins to live a romance, despite the chaos that is caused by the arrival of three more Krypton inhabitants: the criminals who, soon at the beginning of the first movie, we have seen being thrown into space. The film is, on the whole, a poor sequel. I felt there was an effort to learn from mistakes and improve the story told, but I think Clark and Lois' romance is one of the less interesting points of the film, and that it may have displeased many comic book fans. For me, who enjoyed seeing the way he hid his identity and tried to court her at the same time, it was a bit annoying. One of the most notable improvements is the introduction of three truly menacing villains, capable of making the ""man of steel"" sweat a little, despite the maintenance of the despicable Lex Luthor and the tiresome and somewhat fetishistic mania that Zod, the leader of the villains, has to have people kneeling before him. Christopher Reeve remains an honorable and dignified Superman, even though he's not as fresh and committed as would be desirable. Also, Margot Kidder seems to be doing well and Gene Hackman, despite hardly showing up, takes advantage of the opportunities to try to do better than he did in the first film. Overall I liked the work of Terence Stamp, an actor who usually did not appear in big productions and is not so flashy and recognized, but has talent and ability. Even so, I felt that he overacts and sounds artificial many times. On a technical level, the film continues to focus on elaborate and eye-catching visual effects, following in the footsteps of the first film. It's not surprising, then, nor how cheap, primitive and unbelievable it is for our eyes, today. The cinematography seems to me slightly better than in the first film, as it is not so nebulous and makes a positive use of the filming locations and sets, which are more natural and elegant. It's a shorter than its predecessor, and that's another notable improvement. The soundtrack, on the other hand, is basically inherited from the initial movie, which is good.","OCT 30, 2021",3.0,sci-fi

Clearly the movie was going for some sort of wireless frequency and once the aliens arrived they took over internet servers. There is no such thing as a frequency we never knew existed, not within known tech. There are only frequencies that are not usable for various physics reasons.

Assassin 33 A.D.,"It's almost funny how the user reviews on this site have been completely ruined by thin-skinned, snowflake, whiney conservatives. They brigade any media that they think might offend them (if they bothered watching/playing it). Sometimes all it takes is that the show contain a **** or a transgender person in a normal role. Sometimes it's a TV show or movie that portrays the VERY REAL truth of the African American experience in America in the 1950s and 60s. Sometimes it literally just needs to have a woman as the leading role. You don't bother WATCHING these things. Most of you dont even bother writing actual reviews... Someone just told you that there was this movie that had **** in it so you went to Metacritic and scored it a 0 because the thought of it triggers you. It doesn't matter that **** exist whether you like it or not, so it makes sense to have stories about them. And then we have this trash calling itself ""film."" Oh and look, all of the uncultured rejects who gave Watchmen a 0 (despite never watching a single episode) simply because it's about the black struggle in America and that upsets you for some reason, you're all here to rave about how great this pandering trash is because it's about Jesus and ""forcing science to humble itself before God"" or some dangerously stupid message. A story so full of plot holes that there are contradictions IN THE TRAILER ITSELF (though I don't expect these people to catch contradictions... after all, they ignore them in the Bible)... Grow up and open your mind to some real art. Step out of your comfort zone of ""Christianity proves to the world once again that it's superior"" garbage propaganda disguising itself as ""film"" and watch some actual film. You might learn something and stop brigading quality media because you can't handle the thought of a transgender person existing.","SEP 8, 2020",0.0,sci-fi

Inception,"This is not just Nolan's weakest film to date, I feel it's one of the most overpraised movies of this century. Inception has got to be the most insultingly superficial and unimaginative depiction of the human mind ever put to celluloid. The characterisation is terrible. In fact there is no characterisation. Nothing is revealed about the supporting characters. Their motivations and intentions are left blank and there's not a shred of humanity in any of them. Half the characters have only one task - to explain the plot to the audience. It almost feels like Nolan distributes the expository dialogue among the unimportant characters and saves the actual bit for the important characters. They're merely subjects to experimentation. And Nolan still doesn't know how to write adult women. Nolan's women tend to be ruled by their lady feelings before ultimately capitulating to the men around them. Mal is, by far, the worst example (so far). Anne Hathaway's Brandt would be second. And this is where Nolan's exposition spins wildly out of control. He spends the first half dictating all the rules of the dreamland and then spends the other half dictating how to break all these rules. And why do all these dreams feel like James Bond movies? I never understood why Inception is soooo action oriented. It almost feels like a video game at times. And there's not a shred of depth to it. I keep asking myself ""why did nolan go to such great lengths to make this movie? what is he trying to convey through it?"" And the answer is nothing. He's just created a world with no ideas. That's why the movie feels so cold and mechanical. And keep in mind Nolan is often praised for dealing with dark philosophical ideas (especially in Memento and his first 2 batman movies) but Inception doesn't bother with that. It's not just superficial, it's pretentious. This is the perfect example of a film that can fool people into thinking it's profound and deep. It's not.","JAN 20, 2015",3.0,sci-fi

Cloud Atlas,"The Wachowskys, without a doubt, have lost their way a long time ago, and if they thought that with this film they were going to recover, they are clear. If they hit the ball with 'Matrix' and got screwed with 'M. Reloaded' and 'M. Revolutions', then with 'Speed ​​Racer' they sank even further, with this one, they have thrown themselves into a bottomless pit. Many people called these brothers GENIUS, VISIONARIES with 'Matrix'. 'Matrix' is fine, but not a revolutionary work. Simply a rehash of dystopian science fiction and well-sold Hong Kong cinema, I said when I saw 'The Matrix' that geniuses are nothing at all, copypasting is not being geniuses, then with the sequels they proved me right, 2 freaked out otakus of life, because now they pretend to be profound and metaphysical...come on! They don't even believe it! I want to say that I have NOT read the book, so I am only going to give my opinion as a movie, not as an adaptation. 'Cloud Atlas' is a true chaos and a monstrous and disproportionate film, imagine that you take 6 mediocre films and put them in the same film, but when you see that there are almost 8 hours of film, you start to cut and cut until leave it in 3 hours, the plot....plot?, I hope, it is simply a bunch of films concentrated and assembled into one, which supposedly the stories are related by merely banal things or that have no apparent meaning, in others words MCGUFFINS (a book, some birthmarks, a button), which like good mcguffins, they don't even deign to explain them to you. The stories, as I have said, are a set of conclusive stories, of mediocre films, some of which lack logic and sense, since they do NOT explain absolutely anything. The plots are completely random stories, a story in 1858 with a lawyer and a black man on a boat, 1 **** who composes a sonata for an old fool who has the melody in his head in the 30s, another She is a journalist who tries to uncover some guys who want to cause a Chernobyl (??), a cloned Chinese who becomes a messiah in a cyberpunk Seoul, an editor who flees from some thugs and is locked up in an asylum (the part funnier, by the way) and finally a kind of planet of the apes with Tom Hanks as the protagonist. Then we find the same actors in the segments of the film characterized in crazy and bizarre ways that seem like something from the chanante hour, all the actors become Chinese, even the black ones, poor Hugo Weaving is turned into a nurse who is a bastard. a nursing home, in SPOCK!! and into a Leprechaun, and Tom Hanks is characterized as a gazillion old men, Halle Berry is turned into a Chinese cyborg, into a white Jew and.... Hugh Grant into a URUK HAI!! The only thing that stands out about the film is that visually it is spectacular, very good special effects, which makes me think that this film reminds me too much of '**** Punch!', many special effects, incredible combats, but 0 in script, and exactly that happens to this film. In conclusion, the film is a true disaster, chaotic, unfathomable, drawn out to the point of boredom and surely, this is the typical film that over-the-top glasses and hipsters, who for seeing a Kitano film in their lifetime, will praise it and They will say that she is wonderful and a lot of pompous and empty synonyms, because they cannot understand what shit they have told her.","SEP 13, 2016",1.0,sci-fi
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith,"Ewan McGregor is awesome again as Obi-wan and Ian McDarmid as Palpatine but the rest of the rest cast ranges from poor to forgettable. Though you can see it from a mile away the betrayal of the Clones with Order 66 is probably the best moment of the movie. Unfortunately, the moment that the entire trilogy, nay the entire Star Wars series up to that point, counts on fails miserably. That moment is Anakin's falls to the darkside and it is unforgivable thus the hard rating. From the original trilogy we were told that Anakin was seduced by the power of the darkside. Instead it went something like this: Through half of the movie, Anakin is shown to be a trusted Jedi who has a great relationship with his mentor and friend Obi-wan Kenobi. When the two Jedi friends are separated, Palpatine starts ""luring"" Anakin to the darkside with tales of the Sith and trying to pit the Jedi Knight against the council. Anakin finally learns that Palpatine is the Sith Lord that they have been looking for. He never puts 2 and 2 together that, as the Sith Lord, Palpatine has been playing both sides of the war. Obvious because there are always only 2 Sith and Dooku was named as a Sith earlier in the movie. Palpatine has been the reason for so many Jedi and Clone Troopers murdered and countless of civilians killed over the past few years. Anakin doesn't seem to care. Palpatine feeds him some line that he can help him save Padme from death. This is the guy that hid from Anakin for 13 years the fact that he was the sworn enemy of the Jedi. At first Anakin goes to inform the Jedi Council who immediately send a group over to arrest the chancellor. Here we see the worst excuse for a lightsaber fight in Star Wars' history. It's just laughable. Jedi MASTERS literally just stand there while they get stabbed. Anakin walks in at the last minute and has to make a quick decision to save: A) the sworn enemy of the Jedi that just lied to him for 13 years B) his friend, colleagues and brothers who helped raise him since a boy The rest goes down in terrible cinematic history. Palpatine's first order after Anakin's heart wrenching decision is to go back to the temple and murder everyone he has ever known... and some children. Anakin goes from heroic war-hero savior to child slayer in less than 2 hours. Where was the gradual seduction to the power of the darkside? Instead we got some seduction by a creepy old liar and one hasty split second decision.

Cloud Atlas,"The Wachowskys, without a doubt, have lost their way a long time ago, and if they thought that with this film they were going to recover, they are clear. If they hit the ball with 'Matrix' and got screwed with 'M. Reloaded' and 'M. Revolutions', then with 'Speed ​​Racer' they sank even further, with this one, they have thrown themselves into a bottomless pit. Many people called these brothers GENIUS, VISIONARIES with 'Matrix'. 'Matrix' is fine, but not a revolutionary work. Simply a rehash of dystopian science fiction and well-sold Hong Kong cinema, I said when I saw 'The Matrix' that geniuses are nothing at all, copypasting is not being geniuses, then with the sequels they proved me right, 2 freaked out otakus of life, because now they pretend to be profound and metaphysical...come on! They don't even believe it! I want to say that I have NOT read the book, so I am only going to give my opinion as a movie, not as an adaptation. 'Cloud Atlas' is a true chaos and a monstrous and disproportionate film, imagine that you take 6 mediocre films and put them in the same film, but when you see that there are almost 8 hours of film, you start to cut and cut until leave it in 3 hours, the plot....plot?, I hope, it is simply a bunch of films concentrated and assembled into one, which supposedly the stories are related by merely banal things or that have no apparent meaning, in others words MCGUFFINS (a book, some birthmarks, a button), which like good mcguffins, they don't even deign to explain them to you. The stories, as I have said, are a set of conclusive stories, of mediocre films, some of which lack logic and sense, since they do NOT explain absolutely anything. The plots are completely random stories, a story in 1858 with a lawyer and a black man on a boat, 1 **** who composes a sonata for an old fool who has the melody in his head in the 30s, another She is a journalist who tries to uncover some guys who want to cause a Chernobyl (??), a cloned Chinese who becomes a messiah in a cyberpunk Seoul, an editor who flees from some thugs and is locked up in an asylum (the part funnier, by the way) and finally a kind of planet of the apes with Tom Hanks as the protagonist. Then we find the same actors in the segments of the film characterized in crazy and bizarre ways that seem like something from the chanante hour, all the actors become Chinese, even the black ones, poor Hugo Weaving is turned into a nurse who is a bastard. a nursing home, in SPOCK!! and into a Leprechaun, and Tom Hanks is characterized as a gazillion old men, Halle Berry is turned into a Chinese cyborg, into a white Jew and.... Hugh Grant into a URUK HAI!! The only saving grace of the film, which is why it has (a bed base and not 0), is that visually it is spectacular, very good special effects, which makes me think that this film reminds me too much of '**** Punch !', many special effects, incredible combats, but 0 script, and exactly that happens to this film. In conclusion, the film is a true disaster, chaotic, unfathomable, drawn out to the point of boredom and surely, this is the typical film that over-the-top glasses and hipsters, who for seeing a Kitano film in their lifetime, will praise it and They will say that she is wonderful and a lot of pompous and empty synonyms, because they cannot understand what shit they have told her.","JUL 19, 2015",3.0,sci-fi

"I, Tonya","I had little interest in the Harding/Kerrigan incident when it actually occurred, and so I was surprised that I genuinely enjoyed this movie and was motivated by it subsequently to watch online a recent ABC documentary about the affair. The movie is compelling, to some extent, the way a train wreck is: so many of the principals in the drama--including Tonya herself--were dysfunctional, low-rent ne'er-do-wells living lives of chaotic desperation and inflicting their pathologies on each other like the norovirus. All of the actors do a remarkable job of bringing to the screen the real-life qualities of their characters, although the young woman playing Tonya arguably is a bit too classically beautiful to be mistaken for Tonya, who, on a good day, might be charitably described as ""cute."" The people tasked with creating the ice skating scenes did an extraordinary job with their special effects. It is a relief, at the end of the film, to learn that most of the loony tunes who had sullied Olympic history ultimately grew up and achieved some stability and productivity later in life, although the obese possuer who had appointed himself Tonya's bodyguard croaked at the age of 40.","MAR 13, 2018",8.0,sport
Shaolin Soccer,"Kung Fu / martial arts mixed with soccer shouldn't be such an entertaining idea but it creates an experience that is unforgettable and an all out attack on your risible muscles. It is the story of Sing a Kung Fu master who drifts trough life wanting to teach / show society the practical and spiritual benefits of Kung Fu. He meets Fung a legendary but now handicapped former soccer star who is betrayed by businessman Hung. Together they try to form a soccer team with Sings former Shaolin brothers. Sounds crazy but works so well. All of them have incredible martial arts skills that they use to outmaneuver their opponents. It is a great parody as special effects were used to enhance the Kung Fu skills to superhuman levels. It has also a sweet lovestory, side blows in many direction (like fair play as soccer is war, sportsware contracts etc.) and an enjoyable villain with Hung and his evil team. Alone the climax with the game against the evil team is worth watching the movie. It helps that they hit the sweet spot between seriousness and goofy parody. The humor works very well and I cant remember a misfire (Remark: There could be things I did not understand because of my European background). It is directed by Stephen Chow who is a legend in Hong Kongs film-industry. He made a hidden gem of martial arts / comedy here. Then we have an excellent cast with lead actor Stephen Chow as Sing, Ng Man-tat as Fung, the Shaolin brothers Wong Yat Fei, Lam Chi Chung, Mok Mei-lam, Tin Kai-man, Danny Chan Kwok Kwan (looks like Bruce Lee) and Zhao Wei as Sings love interest. All nailed their roles and make this movie an incredible experiences. Then there is Patrick Tse as Hung who is so enjoyable diabolic and his menacing evil team. I still have a smile on my face remembering them. Sadly it is an unrecognized or forgotten masterpiece. It was pretty successful and earned high ratings by critics. Overall I was lucky to see this in cinema. It is one of the most entertaining martial arts comedies out there and a must see for its humor and ideas alone.","NOV 14, 2020",10.0,sport

It was really well done, Archie Madekwe and David Harbour were fantastic in it, and it had a nice balance between the biopic style of the Senna movie and the old Jerry Bruckheimer style of Days Of Thunder. My only complaint was the GT video game imagery during the police chase scene, I understand why they did it, but considering the film as a whole was more of a serious sports film based on a true story related to the video game, it seemed out of place and tacked on for the sake of it.

All of this tied together with a amazing soundtrack and beautiful shots.","JAN 14, 2020",9.0,sport
Waves,"Bleak, but never despondent; confidant and audacious filmmaking As with writer/director Trey Edward Shults's previous films, the unconventional Thanksgiving drama Krisha (2015) and the brilliant but poorly marketed post-apocalyptic thriller It Comes at Night (2017), Waves is about a family under intense pressure. And as with those films, if you're into formalism, you'll find plenty here to keep you happy; elaborate camera moves, varying aspect ratios, unusual colour correction, striking shot composition, a sound design which bleeds into the soundtrack/score (and vice versa), and a quite audacious shift in focalisation at the half-way point. On the other hand, it's emotionally bruising and takes its sweet time getting anywhere, asking rather a lot from the viewer. But if you have the patience and are willing to take the journey on which the film wants to bring you, the cathartic rewards are many. In a middle-class suburb in Florida, Tyler Williams (Kelvin Harrison Jr.) is a popular high school senior and skilled wrestler. Deeply in love with his girlfriend Alexis (Alexa Demie), he also has a good relationship with his sister Emily (Taylor Russell) and stepmother Catherine (Renée Elise Goldsberry). However, His relationship with his father Ronald (Sterling K. Brown in full-on stare mode) is somewhat strained due to Ronald, himself a former athlete who was forced to retire due to a knee injury, constantly pushing him to succeed. When Tyler is diagnosed with a Level 5 SLAP tear, he's told he'll need surgery or the damage will become permanent. However, he continues to wrestle and starts to self-medicate with Ronald's painkillers. At around the half-way point of the film, the focalisation then shifts to the socially awkward Emily and her burgeoning romance with Tyler's wrestling teammate Luke (Lucas Hedges). Meanwhile, the family must try to come to terms with a horrific act of violence. The most noticeable thing about Waves is the aesthetic audaciousness, and for all its narrative gymnastics, it's the visuals that really pop. No matter how elaborate Shults's use of form becomes, it's always in service of the story, with the camera being used thematically rather than as a passive tool of observation. For example, the opening scene inside a car occupied by Tyler and Alexis is shot with the camera spinning in circles, completing multiple 360-degree rotations, immediately inculcating us into their sense of abandonment and exuberance. In the first half of the narrative, which is focalised by the restless Tyler, the handheld camera rarely stops moving, reflecting his frenetic energy. However, when we shift to the quieter Emily, Shults uses more tripod shots and a slower editing rhythm, reflecting Emily's calmer disposition. Additionally, whereas the first half is awash in garish blues, reds, and greens, the second has a more muted naturalistic look. Another crucial part of the visual design is the aspect ratio(s). Beginning in 1.85:1, the frame gradually reduces in width until it gets to 1.33:1, which is how Tyler's section ends. Then, at the start of Emily's section, it starts to widen again, eventually reaching 2.35:1. The narrowing ratio of the first half reflects how Tyler feels he's being progressively trapped as things continue to go wrong, whilst the widening ratio of the second half reflects Emily's determination to recover from tragedy and reconcile her family. It's pure cinema, showing rather than telling. Looking at the themes, Ronald barely acknowledges Emily, instead pouring all his effort into Tyler, through whom he's trying to live vicariously, pushing him to be the successful athlete that he himself could have been. However, Ronald is by no means the villain. He seems to genuinely feel that raising Tyler in this manner is the best thing, telling him, ""I don't push you because I want to, I push you because I have to"". The problem with all of this is that neither Tyler nor Ronald have a backup plan, so when things start to go wrong, Tyler immediately falls apart, essentially becoming a pseudo-Job figure, albeit without Job's self-awareness. In terms of problems, there are a few blatantly expositionary scenes, such as a scene where Ronald outlines how hard it is for a black man to get ahead in the US. It just doesn't ring true that this is the first time Ronald has said this to Tyler. Surely he would have given him this talk in his youth? It's a well-acted scene in isolation, but in the context of the overall script, it's too literal. Additionally, Shults tends to veer close to melodrama on occasion. Nevertheless, although it's initially bleak, Waves ultimately reveals itself to be about the ability of love to conquer despair, about how life can persist no matter the circumstances, about the importance and restorative power of family. Shults uses this framework to build a quite audacious monument that celebrates the ordinary without ever overshadowing it.","FEB 5, 2020",8.0,sport

Handsome Devil,"Music, sport and then there's ****. I have seen many **** films, but I never felt very satisfied as this one. It removed all the cliches. You don't get a product like that often. I mean, despite being a **** film, there's no romance in it. But everything was told from a different aspect, like whether it is in the eye of sport, music, et cetera. Maybe if one film that families should watch regarding **** theme, that could be this one. Of course the families should be open minded on LGBT for that. Because the film does not promote ****, but in a normal tone to say, it's about harassment being whatever you are. And at the end gives a fine message. Welcome to T18. I mean happy new year. This is my first review of the year. It is a good start for me being a cinephile. As I've said, it is a rare gem. An Irish film, but in English language. Remember, it is not even a British or Aussie, so the cast and crew are completely unknown. That means it is like watching some B movie. The initial setup reminded me 'Wild Child'. But that was an American film, from Americans perspective, how they see British boarding school. So if you are regular Hollywood teen film watcher, then you might feel slightly strange watching this. Because the students are obedient against their teacher, unlike American rebellious kids. -xX] There will come a point in the future when you won't have to lie anymore. [Xx- The film title might hint strongly that it is a **** romance, but as I said it was not. This is the story of two boys, but most of it was narrated from Ned's perspective. When his parents moved to Southwestern Asia for work, he was left behind at a boarding school. Among bullies, he's very popular for his sexual orientation. But it was never been confirmed, until a new roommate joins him. He's handsome and a rugby player, but they both put together for a talent show, where they have to prepare a song to sing. So the conflict of interest between sport and music surface and fuels further complication in what it is already out of control. This film was made last year, before that year was when the same-sex marriage legalised in Ireland. But the timeline of the film is unknown. Mostly like it just before the legalisation. Because seeing how the story happened, it all makes sense. Still a mixed response from the people, the **** are hesitating to come out of the closet. So the harassers still targeting such people, that's what this film is about. In addition to that, the story was told from the teenager's perspective, but I loved that small part of aspect from a teacher. That kind of looked like a bonus advantage of the film. Regarding Rugby, it was part of the storytelling, not the whole story. So whatever happen in the sporting event was a normal result than considered as a cliche. The same goes for the music part of the film too. It did delivered the message cleverly. The best of it was how these two themes were merged to get a wonderful awareness film. Not just one of the best **** film, but one of the best films of the year. Totally worth a watch! 7/10","FEB 3, 2018",7.0,sport

But that doesn't mean I'm gonna be hating on this movie just because it isn't as charming or sweet as Cars 1. Cars 2 has its own unique style of blending Pixar with the action genre, and it blends perfectly. Will it appeal to kids like me when I was 7? I don't know.

Warrior,"""Warrior"" strikingly illustrates that victory is possible in defeat, and it's not what happens during the final bout that defines Gavin O' Connor's picture, but what occurs afterwards. ""Warrior"" is a poignant, touching drama where familiarity with the sport isn't necessary, because ultimately it's not about what transpires in the cage. The movie presents dynamic, strained relationships and the bond of family, coupled with the challenging choices we must make throughout life. The narrative focuses on three men: estranged brothers Tom and Brendan Conlon (Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton) and their father, Paddy (Nick Nolte). Tom, a withdrawn marine, has come home to Pittsburgh to train for a spot in ""Sparta,"" a winner-takes-all MMA tournament held in Atlantic City. He is willing to put aside his abusive upbringing in return for his assistance in training. Paddy, a recovering alcoholic, embraces the opportunity to reconnect with his son, even though Tom makes is clear that their relationship will consist strictly as one of trainer and fighter. Meanwhile, across the state in Philadelphia, former UFC fighter and current high school teacher Brendan finds himself in need of cash in order to save his home from foreclosure. Against the wishes of Brendan's wife Tess (Jennifer Morrison), Brendan becomes involved in low-level MMA contests, and suspended by the school board once word spreads. One would need be hopelessly naïve not to recognize that this is all going to come down to a match between Tom and Brendan, with a torn father on the sidelines. The first half of the film is mostly devoted to the dramatic setup and character development, before it launches into the Atlantic City bouts that take up the majority of the second half of the film. ""Warrior"" offers strong performances across the board, two of which are standouts. Tom Hardy, who redefined his career with his screen-searing work in ""Bronson,"" (2008) is simply tremendous. The word ""volcanic"" was often used to describe Hardy's work in ""Bronson,"" and it applies here as well. Nick Nolte, who has received his share of accolades over a long and prosperous career, provides a terrific performance as a remorseful father who is desperate to reconnect with his sons. This real battle here is outside of the cage, involving redemption, reconciliation, and putting demons to rest. O'Connor's filming has a gritty, grainy, sensibility that is only enhanced by utilizing locations around the Pittsburgh area. Putting aside the fighting in the cage, it's the emotional tussle they must contend with that is far more daunting than any opponent in the cage. ""Warrior"" has the heart of a champion that keeps this film alive and pumping to the bloody end.","AUG 27, 2013",8.0,sport

Cars 2,"Criminally underrated, Cars 2 is a unique twist on the Pixar formula that manages to bring the spy genre into the world of the previous film and somehow make it work. I love Mater, and it’s great that he gets to have his own film. He has so much charm and personality that it is difficult not to love him. He may act silly from time to time, but that’s what makes him so great. The plot is pretty well executed. Most modern spy films are confusing and don’t make sense, but things are a lot easier to follow here. Even the villains are great characters - the fact they pretty much work as a family make them so much more relatable, especially considering what they have had to put up with. The film’s message about being yourself and not letting others change you is honestly a lesson far too many people take for granted.

The film itself is excellent. Beautiful views of snowy mountains and skiers who ""fly"" over them. The duet of Taron Egerton and Hugh Jackman perfectly showed all the chemistry between the characters. All the funny moments were in the theme, and these long jumps were breathtaking every time.

Breaking Away,"One of the best films of the 1970’s. An exceptionally well-written story about the lives **** of young men as they transition from high school to adulthood. That their futures will likely be dictated by their families’ limitations, adds resonance to this thoughtful comedy, and also serves as an indictment of the American dream. Children of quarry workers (known as “cutters”), in an Indiana town that is home to an Ivy League College, the economic disparity the boys are witness to daily only emphasizes their seemingly forgone futures. There are moments in this film that literally had contemporary audiences leaping from their seats to cheer. And though the movie’s unabashed sincerity may seem naive today, it is no less effective than it was in 1979. Superb performances, especially from Paul Dooley and Barbara Barrie, with breakout performances from Dennis Christopher and Jackie Earle Haley, it features an inspiring score, fantastic film editing, and brilliant direction. A moving, funny, sometimes heartbreaking rumination on American youth and family, that is more hopeful than most films of the decade, and more eloquent that most films, period.","FEB 2, 2018",10.0,sport

Bobby Fischer Against the World,"This is an excellent, thorough look at the life of chess genius Bobby Fischer - his life, his short but brilliant career, and his downfall. Fischer comes across as a gifted, obsessive fanatic. When he devoted himself to chess, he became the best in the world, perhaps the best ever. But the film shows us his painful childhood, as the son of a flaky mother who abandoned him at age 16, literally left him and his sister alone in a Brooklyn apartment. We get a brief look at his biological father, who tried to be there for him but who died at a young age. The name Fischer came from one of his mom's boyfriends, who apparently was not in the picture for long. Bobby was a king in the world of chess, but a lost soul in the world at large, and eventually became paranoid and loony, embracing anti-semitism (he was Jewish) and an extreme Christian church, before appearing on the world stage again toward the end of his life. Fischer's life was a frequently sad, but fascinating, story, and we see a lot of it thru the eyes of his good friends, which he did have several of. There is some good archival footage included too, especially from the famous match between Fischer and Spassky. It is hard to picture how this documentary could be made any better.","MAR 16, 2021",10.0,sport

Bigger Stronger Faster*,"This could have easily been a much simpler, dryer film. Instead of being a bland recital of the same information you can get a thousand other places or propaganda pushing either the pros or cons of steroids, BSF relates the issue to American culture itself, illuminating the contradictions between the exaltation we give our greatest performers and the ridicule for the measures it takes to be such in the modern world. Its comparisons to legal performance enhancing drugs, more dangerous nonenhancing legal drugs, the supplement industry as a whole, and 'reefer madness' fearmongering can be both enlightening and desensationalizing. This is not an endorsement of steroid use but an analysis of its motivations and critique of those on both sides of the fence that happens to demystify many popular (often negative) assumptions. All of that wouldn't amount to as much if it wasn't just so damn entertaining to boot. Right from the start it hooks you with its charismatic narration and choice footage and then keeps drawing you in with insightful interviews and the personal tale of the film's central family. It's one of the best documentaries I've seen; the kind where you wonder how you hadn't watched it sooner. Just try to leave prior bias at the door.","SEP 28, 2016",10.0,sport

Warrior,"Here you go, another good film of 2011. It seems like an ordinary action/fighting but one must not be deceived by the looks of this film, there's 'Extra' delight in it. warrior features a less-popular cast which includes Joel Edgerton, Tom Hardy, Nick Nolte and Jeniffer Morisson. Perhaps the biggest letdown of Warrior is the clichés which it possesses. It follows the route of many mediocre films, a character is equipped with insufficient talent or experience, faces a problem, joins a competition or goes for a fight and ultimately achieves victory, and you will see that in Warrior. Despite being clichéd, it is still well-occupied with a properly written screenplay. Fine dialogue throughout the movie and what makes Warrior a worthy experience is the moving elements that it contains. A fiercely moving motion picture is what Warrior is. The fighting scenes of the film, which takes up the majority of the movie's moments, are choreographed wonderfully. Having established a fine direction for it's action scenes during the movie's final hours, is like witnessing a real MMA matches in high definition, rather than watching a film, and I think that is an utmost quality of movie-making and I could conclude that Gavin O'Connor is a promising, talented and 'far above the level of mediocrity' filmmaker. The acting performances in this film are spectacular. Tom hardy plays Tommy Conlon whose character is disturbed by past events which made him 'harder'. Hardy's performance in this film is so good that I would say 'It could have knocked me out for a second' and I think Tom Hardy is one of the most consistent actors working in Hollywood today. On the other side of the note, there is Joel Edgerton, a completely unknown Australian actor to me, who plays Brendan Conlon and too gives a delightful performance. The element which makes Edgerton's delivery is good is the naturalistic materials which he possessed, and he's well composed too. But, in my opinion, the actor which stands out from the rest is Nick Nolte. His portrayal of a father filled with mistakes moved me much. In addition, Nolte's perfect navigation on his body movement, facial expression and verbal communication is perfect and that will lead to a conclusion that Nick Nolte is a very skilled actor. Yes, Warrior is very much clichéd, but I guess those clichés are neutralized by fine performances and impeccable moving moments. A great film, but not a masterpiece for sure.

Early Man,"I went to see “Early Man” today with a certain set of expectations. From a critical standpoint, I know I should go into any movie with a bit of a blank slate. Still, there will occasionally be one of those actors, directors, or producers of which I am a huge fan. I feel like there cannot possibly be a bad product. However, Robert De Niro has taught me that for every “The Godfather Part 2”, there is an equal and opposite “The Comedian” – same artist, noticeably different results. Having said that, I have not yet had that experience with Nick Park and Aardman Animations. The same folks that gave us “Wallace & Grommit”, “Chicken Run” and “Flushed Away” have once again had me either lightly giggling or chuckling uncontrollably in the movie theater. Aardman’s clay animation techniques have transitioned quiet well into the digital age (as “Shaun the Sheep” has shown). This is balanced by the fact that Park and Aardman clearly know their roots as I could see things clearly influenced by “The Flintstones” and “The 2000 Year Old Man”. Along with the great storyline and comic dialogue is a great cast which includes Maisie Williams (“Game of Thrones”), Eddie Redmayne (“Les Misérables”), Roy Ayoade (“The IT Crowd”), and Timothy Spall (pretty much every Aardman film). Like the Aardman works that came prior to “Early Man”, I can assure that this movie will quickly become part of my home video collection with me quoting dialogue repeatedly","FEB 17, 2018",10.0,sport

Populaire,"Taking a page from other French films, Populaire is a whimsical yet adult French comedy with enough going on beneath the surface to make watching it unique despite its similarities to other French films, most notably 2011's Romantics Anonymous. Populaire tells the story of Rose (Deborah Francois), a young French woman who moves from her small village life to the hustle and bustle of the big city in 1959 to become a secretary, a job she finds difficult and to avoid getting fired she agrees to take part in a typing competition, something that may bring Rose and her boss Louis (Romain Duris) closer. While not as polished and delightful as Amelie or the aforementioned Romantics Anonymous, Populaire does charm you from beginning to end thanks to its three fantastic lead performances by Francois, Duris and Bernice Bejo as Louis old friend and ex lover. Most of the credit goes to Francois who manages to make her often childish character realistic and moving thanks to her ability to read the subtleties of a scene. She manages to be quirky and adult at the same time, an admirable feat. The scripting is clever as it incorporates the idea of a society still recovering from the devastation of the war almost 15 years on as well as the the desire to modernise, something we are still feeling today. The film uses the war to add colour to its characters, especially Louis who unlike the conventional war veteran has no fear of what he saw, just everything waiting for him back home, especially Marie (Bejo). It's a rose tinted film so it does turn a bit saccharine towards the end but it is to be expected from a French film about love, it has to end well.","SEP 9, 2013",7.0,sport

Some may argue that it's melodramatic as hell, but it captures the spirit of the original Rocky and gives a satisfying ending to this disjointed franchise.","JUN 24, 2015",9.0,sport
Hot Rod,"Hot Rod is a great movie for families with kids I would say at least 15 or above. This is an AMAZING movie. It has lots of comedy elements to make it a great movie. It has comedy, randomness, and adult/teen humor.

It is a great hilarious movie and i love it.","NOV 8, 2014",10.0,sport
The Way Back,"""The Way Back"" prefaces itself as a stereotypical docudrama with a predictable ending, yet the story is nothing of the sorts. A fictional film, ""The Way Back,"" starring Ben Affleck, tells the heartbreaking story of an alcoholic coping with recovery amid coaching a basketball team. Though the film is truly entertaining, it has a bit of an abrupt ending, leaving too much unanswered.

Gran Turismo,"Although it may seem like an advertisement for big brands like Nissan or PlayStation, the adaptation of the video game ""Gran Turismo"" does well on the screen, surrounding itself with a story told efficiently, even if, technically, **** at certain points .This is a story based on real events, following young Jann, a video game player who, given the fantastic numbers achieved in the game (and, of course, the existence of a database capable of ""discovering"" him), he is selected to participate in a competition with the best aspiring professional runners. Depending on the score and performance, he will sign with a professional team to join major events, provoking, of course, the wrath of the more traditional runners (here, unfortunately , treated with a high dose of Manichaeism).The film, however, gets it right in its agile and vibrant editing, not only in the competitions that are not tiring to follow (certain phases fly by), but also in some scenes in which the young man is transported from the room where he plays video game to the real track, and vice versa, showing the symbiosis and the strong point of knowledge of the game to achieve excellence on the track, with imaginary lines being put on screen, or even a pilot identification hologram, as if we were watching a race in the video game itself. In fact, a large part of the Grand Turismo community considers the experience so fantastic that it wouldn't even be a game, but a simulator, and one of the best. I won't go into the merits because I didn't even play the game, but the film ends up creating fan service with the situation, and in a light way. Of course, the script goes too far beyond reality, even if it is based on real facts, especially the order of events and the relationship with his parents, who, despite their heavy hand here, remained highly functional and ****however, the talent of the protagonist must be highlighted here, who conveys innocence in his eyes, as well as the firmness in the last scenes that They make everything very believable. And even in the dramatic scenes, he managed to convey the contained emotion with dignified intonation work. Excellent **** racing scenes could indeed have been more exciting, but the accident scene alone is worth the price of admission, tense and well done, just the right amount to feel the physical impact, but what about the psychological impact where everything takes on a different contour? above the media here, in fact, the editing and editing of the film, knowing the limited material, manage to make the film an always engaging experience. It's exciting, the main character captivates, and it has elements to discuss the impacts of artificial intelligence (simulators ) in concrete life. Although it does not delve into this last theme, indulging in the pernicious cliché that revolves around ""focus, overcoming and family"", the film ends up delivering an efficient story in its chosen script line, offering quality entertainment. The session was worth it.","DEC 30, 2023",8.0,sport
"I, Tonya","The anger that the film left me with on behalf of Tonya Harding (as portrayed here as a character, if not the real person) is a testament to how brilliantly put together the whole thing was. As a piece of writing, the film is mostly terrific (only faltering a little at the climax) the acting of everyone involved is ridiculously spot on, both in terms of performance and impersonation. The stylish presentation of the film is also to be commended, with solid direction, very strong, well timed editing and cinematography that managed to be incredibly involving and visceral at times without ever feeling in your face. The only real faults with the film I could find was the jarring transition between 12 year old and 15 year old Tonya (I don't buy that something that looks like THAT aged 12 would look like Margot Robbie at the age of 15, there should have been another intermediately aged actress for those few scenes.) The aforementioned climax problem (possibly could have been solved through telling the story non-chronologically, but I don't know if that'd have made the story too hard to follow for some people as it is somewhat unconventional already in its support of multiple somewhat contradictory narratives) and most of all I think some of the more repetitive scenes could have been cut back slightly in favor of exploring other angles of the story in more depth. Overall though the film was fantastic.","MAR 14, 2018",9.0,sport

This movie was amazing after the first hour and a half. I would have given it a ten if it ended then but the last forty minutes only supported my decision. One of the most emotional and original films I have ever seen. You really feel for all of the main cast in this film. I went into this film thinking I was going to be impressed by Tom Hardy but I feel that Joel Edgerton had the better performance. Nick Nolte was also amazing in this film, it was probably the best role I've seen him play.

Just the training and studying alone, must have been as intense as the film itself. Franco plays Jake Huard, a first year student at the Naval academy.

The story itself is very inspirational and the acting is top notch. This isn't just a good film, it's one that you know took a lot out of everyone involved. I was entertained, excited, and inspired by an underdog who just wouldn't give up. This is a tremendous film that fell under the radar, because of a then, unknown cast, but it really is a must see for fans of inspirational, military and sports dramas.","FEB 22, 2013",9.0,sport

The emotion felt while watching this was so high for me, and the drama and tension throughout is portrayed and acted in such a poignant way!

"I, Tonya","Forget biopics playing it safe. I, Tonya rips onto the screen like a triple axel with broken blades, a dazzling spectacle of dark humor, raw emotion, and heartbreaking truth. Margot Robbie channels Tonya Harding with ferocity, capturing her grit, vulnerability, and yes, even that infamous whack, without veering into caricature. Director Craig Gillespie masterfully weaves Tonya's story through layers of unreliable narration, blurring the lines between perception and reality. We see her rise from trailer park prodigy to Olympic hopeful, witnessing the brutal training, the constant criticism, and the suffocating shadow of her abusive mother (an unrecognizable Allison Janney, delivering a chillingly good performance). Here's where I, Tonya shines. It refuses to spoon-feed you a clean-cut villain or hero. You cringe at Tonya's choices, gasp at the injustices she faces, and ultimately question who gets to write the narrative of a life lived on the edge. The film doesn't shy away from the dark underbelly of figure skating, exposing the classism, sexism, and the ugly politics that lurked beneath the sequins and perfect smiles.","DEC 26, 2023",10.0,sport
Icarus,"Icarus is a beautifully produced documentary. Kudos to Netflix and Bryan Fogel and his team for making that happen. This is movie might not win the Oscar for the very obvious reason that it does not answer the crucial query of how dangerous and game-changing the act of doping can be in Athletics and similar sports that Fogel has set about to find. On top that of that, this is a telling of reality that that has no redemption or no real justice - The Bad Men will always get away with it, because they hold all the right reins, you see. Even still, stories like these must told every now and then so as to remind even a handful of people of the responsibility they should have to truth. Ignorance maybe Strength in some world but in your mind, only truth holds you slave irrespective of how you feel about it. The story itself is very gripping tale that is narrated in visages of Fogel and Rodchenkov and parallels the analogy of an Orwellian society that has existed for so long that one cannot ever escape it without fatal consequences. It is a tale of people lying and cheating with straight faces and not a blink of doubt and regret in their eyes. It is a tale of horror of human cruelty and foulness while a tale of perseverance induced by hopelessness and knowledge you can't see anymore. This doc should be a shoe-in for the must-watch list of a lifetime.","FEB 4, 2018",8.0,sport

Cars 2,"In my opinion, this movie is really underrated. Of course it has bad points, I agree only with 2 statements: Mater is a little annoying character and the film departs from the main theme of the franchise. Actually, I don't even consider the second statement a disadvantage of the film, because Cars 2 is something different, a bit hard to understand for children, but fun and interesting to watch for teens and adults. Cars 2 has various characters with their different personalities. We have narcissistic Francesco, we have experienced, smart, brave and charismatic Finn. Graphics and soundtrack are also on a top level. Especially I want to highlight the soundtrack. Why the soundtrack, but not the graphics? Because graphics is always great in every Pixar movie, yeah, of course nowadays graphics in 90's and some of 00's Pixar movies are not that good, but it surely looked amazing when the movies just released. The soundtrack for Cars 2 is made by Michael Giacchino, he is a famous composer, who made soundtrack for a lot of popular films such as: Matt Reeves Planet of the Apes, MCU Spider-Man, The Batman (2022) and also Pixar's The Incredibles, The Incredibles 2, Ratatouille and etc. The music in Cars 2 is absolutely amazing, great spy movie soundtrack that gives me goosebumps. Epic Finn McMissle theme, Tokyo theme that is really nice to listen to and the Lemon Pledge theme with a growing tension. Personally, I really want to see Cars 4 being an another Cars spy movie with McMissle, but I would like to see it more dark and dismal, as Cars 2 actually should had been before the change of the plot. I would like to see Cars 4 with a new old antagonist that should had been the villain in Cars 2 - ZIL. I would like to see Cars 4 much more interesting and popular. But all these dreams are just my dreams. To sum up, I want to say that I don't consider Cars 2 a bad film, I think it's a great animated movie, even if my opinion is an effect of nostalgia (I really loved cartoons in my childhood, and Cars movies were one of my favourite films). I don't consider Cars 2 concept a bad idea, as you have already understood after I told about my dreams about Cars 4. But I don't think that expectations about that movie were high, they were just different.","JUN 7, 2022",9.0,sport

More than the story of a sailing contest, it is a testament to the tenacity and vision of this young girl who, despite the chauvenism of the sailing community, achieved her goal and realized her dream. This is film that every young woman should see and appreciate for it demonstrates that dreams can become reality in spite of the prejudices of a male dominated society and the obstacles in general that every dreamer must inevitably encounter. Although the film could just as well have been exhibited in a much shorter version, the viewer nevertheless experiences and understands what these adventurous ladies had to encounter and how meaningful what they accomplished meant to all womanhood far and beyond the contest they participated in.

Warrior,"Sports films are hard to make these days. They’ve fallen into the same trap as romantic comedies and horror movies, in that almost every variation of their plotlines has been done. The ragtag group of underdogs came together and won! Or they lost, but learned a valuable lesson in the process! It’s a problem that all films have to face, but it becomes magnified when it comes to sports films. So how do does a film combat this problem? Well, Warrior’s strategy is to steep its film in realism, get top notch performances from the actors, and above all, understand the sport that the film is about. Director Gavin O’Connor is no stranger to sports films, having previously directed the film Miracle, about the 1980 upset of the US hockey team over the Soviet Union. Both of his films express a wealth of knowledge for each sport, from how they’re filmed and commentated upon, to the actual strategy and action on screen. The main characters, Tommy (Tom Hardy) and Brendan (Joel Edgerton), are brothers and mixed martial arts fighters who compete in a high profile tournament put together by a rich MMA fan. Both Tommy and Brendan are in it for the money more than anything else, as both have families that they need to support. Nick Nolte and Jennifer Morrison also star as their father and Brendan’s wife respectively. As I said before, O’Connor seems to have a firm grasp of MMA, as the fight scenes in Warrior are incredibly realistic. This not only helps raise the tension for the viewer, but also allows them to believe that they are investing in a live sporting event. Outside the ring however, is the true greatness of the film. Working with relatable characters, the actors are able to craft fantastic performances. Tom Hardy and Nick Nolte (who was nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Oscar) are the true standouts. Hardy, a veteran with a fierce exterior but a complex interior, is able to both convincingly destroy opponents in the ring and deliver an emotional gut punch to the audience. Meanwhile, Nolte is incredible to watch as a former alcoholic trying to make amends with his family. While I’ve praised the film for being realistic, there are some elements that are a little hard to believe. For instance, Tommy is shown to possess almost superhuman fighting ability and strength, at one point even ripping a door off of a tank. Just toning him down wouldn’t have hurt, and maybe even improved his storyline. Another minor quibble is how easily the two amateur fighters are able to enter into a tournament with other world famous fighters. Finally, like most films centered on sports, the film’s ending is fairly predictable. Overall, Warrior is a refreshing take on a genre infamously known for its limitations. Taking the feel good, underdog aspect of Rocky and combining it with elements of a family drama like The Fighter (also about brothers who fight) makes this film stand out on its own. For both MMA and film fans, this one is a winner.","FEB 1, 2014",9.0,sport

If it seemed blaw to some viewers, maybe they need to check their hearts and minds - too much yuck has gone in. I for one was happily surprised by the message, performances, and lessons to ponder.

Eddie the Eagle,"If you have ever heard the name ""Eddie the Eagle"" or don't, you have a mandatory appointment in April to see the dramatic feat of the year so far. Personally, I think that the experience is much more enjoyable without knowing the story of real life. Eddie Edwards was the first representative of Britain to participate in the Winter Olympics in 1988. This honest man tried different Olympic sports until he found the fabulous and adventurous ski jump, the surprising thing is that the guy not highlighted by being the best the the matter. The film is responsible for narrating the whole growth of Eddie in terms of sport while providing a dramatic and comic experience from beginning to end. I can only mention, I cried like a small child. Our boy ""Kingsman: The Secret Service"", Taron Egerton comes back to seven art, he introduce himself to 100% in his role, this time not as a super agent, this time with large glasses, hair blond and even a strange blonde moustache. Egerton fills his role as nuanced perfectly balanced tones allowing to see the pure soul of his interpretation. Hugh Jackman plays coach Eddie - a successful athlete champion ski jump that is forced by his heart to help this young man to succeed- . True, the film by Dexter Fletcher is a feast of cliches, but well-structured cliches, with chemistry, support and strength to take forward a true dramatic inspirational artwork. The project is a faithful proof that with less materials, better results. It was a surprise in the Sundance Film Festival and won gold, now, it was a surprise in the rest of the world and the chances of winning a gold more large increase exponentially. Dexter Fletcher has created his own cover letter. However, he knew who was dealing with a persevering man (who was not going to win gold medals) managed to capture history with a conventional double-edged weapon. A bullet from his gun was the comedy. The director was prone to cross the thin border of the comedy to become a mockery or joke based on story. He reached the exact point in the soup to create a succulent dish, excellent aggregation of sugar. Aim, fire. The second bullet is shot, the drama. The main reason was to tell all the mishaps economic, mental, physical and psychological that possessed the guy, for obvious reasons,, the biopic would have to be oriented to the guy, good aggregation of salt. What remains after together salt and sugar in a precise point? A real treat for the palate, in this case the visual palate. The visual presentation of the work was very professional and aesthetic. The cinematography of George Richmond is beautiful and elegant, making feel vertigo on the track of 15m, 30m, or 90m in the same way by using the camera and perfectly positioned angles. And to continue to grow, as it is typical of Hollywood, introduce a few seconds the short but symbolic appearance of Christopher Walken - the trainer of Hugh Jackman - to make it look even more professional. Eddie does not want women, he just wants to his mother, Eddie doesn't want fame, just wants to participate, Eddie does not want alcohol, he only wants to milk, Eddie does not want sex, he just wants love. These characteristics are completely emotional and with a finish that I didn't expect, my tears simply fell for my eyes, but a factor that helped my sadness and joy at the same time, it was the self-identification with the character of Taron (Eddie), I think I saw my future on him. So, well done Egerton! task was made very well. It isn't a story more of the bunch where anything is possible. Dexter's film is sentimental and more deep than it seems, a guy that don't mind the standards of money, education or culture, a guy who fixed a dream in his head and managed to leave a huge mark on world history. ""Eddie the Eagle"" will triumph in most festivals, I promise you. Boldly funny, very well presented, with a 100 in all its aspects, the movie has affected me for rest of my life.

Early Man,"The major issue I have with Early Man is the humor; it's very frustrating to watch a Nick Park movie and find that it relies on potty humor and dull jokes, but I have to admit that some visual jokes were so creative and smart. A lot of clever and imaginative ideas Nick Park has used in Early Man to present the Stone Age which helped to elevate the humor a little bit. The story isn't a new one but it's not a problem at all; it's too simple and offers many sweet and contemporary messages. It's quiet surprising to see a movie nowadays uses its characters to convey some messages cleverly by merging these characters' arcs well with the story. Nick Park also presented a very good background for the cavemen in the first act of the movie which is - unfortunately - the shortest one. The second act is undoubtedly the weakest part of the movie; it was annoyingly fast paced, it came too early in this movie and didn't offer too much to rich the characters nor the setting of the Bronze Age, it also became very slow at its end and was had most of the silly and stupid jokes. The voice acting in Early Man is good specially from Tom Hiddleston who voiced the villain Lord Nooth and I also enjoyed Eddie Redmayne's voice and I found it very fresh to animated movies.

Goon,"I stopped rabidly watching hockey around the mid-90's - after the Rangers/Devil's went back-to-back. I know they've toned down the violence since then, so it's great looking back on this style of hockey, with the talent and the enforcer going hand-in-hand. For me, it was Gretzky - McSorely . Seann William Scott doesn't have to stretch for this role, but he's damned funny. What was unexpected is the strength and comedic contributions of the supporting cast - especially his teammates. They're hilarious. The bottom line is that this is no high-art sports movie like Breaking Away. It's FUN, and I couldn't stop laughing. The romantic slice is handled nicely as well, with the drummer from Sex Bob-omb doing a nice job as the girl who appreciates the blood & guts of minor league hockey and who appreciates the innocence & sincerity of her tough-guy suitor.","MAR 30, 2012",8.0,sport
Eddie the Eagle,"To put it short; 'Eddie the Eagle' is a cliched underdog story, but that isn't enough to say that this movie isn't worth seeing. It has inspiration, it has heart, and, like its lead characters, is warm, fuzzy and aggressively likeable. The movie stars Taron Egerton ('Kingsman: The Secret Service') as Michael Eddie Edwards, who, since he was a young boy, wants to compete in the Olympics. As a child, he has had to have a brace attached to his left leg, which is very similar to the story of 'Forrest Gump' (1994), and as he gets older, he no longer needs them as his legs have fully formed and is able to walk without any support. He decides that he still wants to ski in the Winter Olympics, his loving mother always tries her best to support him and give him some confidence. However, his father is very discouraging and cynical, I couldn't help but feel that the movie was trying its hardest to make him an unlikeable character, but it didn't really work. He seemed like the typical parent that has no faith in any other movie protagonist. On the way, Eddie meets a man named Bronson Peary (Hugh Jackman), who he learns also did what he wanted to do, and they agree to help Eddie get to the best and compete in the Winter Olympics. The movie, directed by Dexter Fletcher is absolutely a fine piece of work, the acting is well committed and the story is a good story to tell. It is, like I said above, very cliched and pretty much like any other movie out there. It plays like 'Forrest Gump' (1994), the very idea of a nobody who quickly becomes a somebody despite the fact that many may have ridiculed this character from achieving their goals. Overall, this is a movie to watch if you like inspirational and underdog films, it's well worth your time to know who this ""Eddie the Eagle"" really is...","MAR 30, 2016",7.0,sport

Eddie the Eagle,"Eddie the Eagle is the inspirational story of Eddie Edwards played by Taron Egerton and is a movie about hopes and never giving up on it. As a kid, he always dreams of being an Olympic athlete and against the odds, it's up to him and Peary (Jackman) to make it a reality. Eddie as a character is compelling and over the top all by himself, and Egerton's performance as this weird and quirky athlete is far from everyone’s favorite Kingsman, which is something to look out for. Also, Jackman's role adds a huge impact on the lead character's development. But when the film tries to do humor, it deflates and creates an unfunny tone. The villain is also forced despite of the fact that it is based from real life. VERDICT: Although it did not ascend above the satisfactory of everyone, this film is still an entertaining biopic which gives tribute and respect to its source material.","JUN 26, 2017",7.0,sport

Jann gets to play a stunt double in the movie for the actor who plays him. Sweet! I don’t play racing video games but I still really enjoyed this movie! The film was directed by Neill Blomkamp. Writing credtis go to Jason Hall, Zach Baylin, and Alex Tse. THINGS I LIKED: Archie Madekwe delivers big time in this! I’m thinking this is his big break in Hollywood. Congrats! David Harbour does an excellent job, as always. Fans of the popular Netflix TV show Stranger Things will love him in this. It’s great to see Orlando Bloom in something again! He hasn’t been in a wide release since 2014! His character is inspired by the real Darren Cox who founded GT Academy to help Sony Playstation give racing gamers a real chance in the world of professional racing drivers. Darren Barnet’s character is inspired by the real Brian Heitkotter, who won the GT Academy with Jann Mardenborough in 2011. You’ll notice a former Spice Girl in the movie: Geri Halliwell. In real life, she’s married to a professional racer for Red Bull: Christian Horner. Djimon Hounsou is underutilized but has one of the most powerful moments in the film. There are so many cool moments in the film. For example, the real Kazunori Yamauchi is the sushi chef in Japan who smiles at Jann. Hungaroring in Hungary was used for many of the racing scenes, designed to look like different locations around the world. Michelin Tires was the official tire partner for the movie, providing all of the rubber in the movie. I love the two songs featured in the movie that the main character listens to a lot: Kenny G: Songbird (1987) and Enya: Orinoco Flow – Sail Away (1988). What do YOU listen to in order to relax, focus, or be inspired by? There is a lot of humor, as well as inspirational lines. The action is exciting and will definitely give gamers the thrill they love. In fact, I love that so many video game elements are included in the telling of this story. Video game movie adaptations used to be notoriously terrible, but are we seeing an uptick of good ones? It sure looks that way. Yay! Two of my four sons work in the video game industry and are thrilled by that. At the end of the movie, we get to see video clips and photographs of the real people involved in the true events told in the movie. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: It’s extremely predictable but I didn’t care. This was fun, made even better by the fact that the events in the story really happened! Some have complained that the details in the story aren’t entirely accurate. I still didn’t care. It’s so inspiring and energizing. TIPS FOR PARENTS: Some profanity We see several racing car wrecks.

Cars 2,"In one of the animation giant's more confusing moves, Pixar's ""Cars 2"" not only abandons everything that made its predecessor a simple and quaint love letter to the American small town, it completely abandons the original genre as well. The transition from comedy to spy film is no small feat and ""Cars 2"" really makes it look as such, struggling mightily to balance its disparate elements. The funny thing is that the parts in play aren't necessarily bad on their own. The conflict and eventual resolution between Lightning McQueen and Mater is fine, the international grand prix sequences are colorful enough to watch and the espionage set pieces vary from decent to surprisingly entertaining.

Space Jam: A New Legacy,"E-Value: 6 Acting: 7 Plot: 5 The Looney Tunes franchise returns to the big screen after being absent for 25 years after 1996’s Space Jam and 18 years after 2003’s Looney Tunes: Back in Action. Just like those two movies and this year’s Tom and Jerry, this one is also a live action/animation hybrid movie. LeBron James (himself) is a well-known and famous basketball player in the NBA who wanted his two sons, Darius and Dom, to follow in his footsteps. Unlike Darius, Dom (Joe) is more interested in video game who wanted to be a video game developer when he grows up. Meanwhile, a computer A.I. at Warner Bros. studios called Al-G Rhythm (Cheadle) gain an interest in LeBron James due to his popularity. LeBron and his son are invited by the studios to discuss a potential movie deals but he decline the offer because not only he sees himself as a basketball player, he thinks the idea itself is very bad from the start. On the other hand, Dom shown an interest in Al-G Rhythm while also revealed in the process that he is going to E3 Game Design camp instead of basketball camp. Not happy with LeBron’s rejection, Rhythm lure both him and his son to the basement server room where they got capture and trap in virtual reality. Rhythm challenge LeBron to a basketball game while holding Dom as his captive and if the latter wins, he will set them both free but if Rhythm wins, they will be trap here forever. After that, Rhythm sends him to Tune World where LeBron meets Bugs Bunny (voiced by Jeff Bergman). Together, they assemble a team consisting of the other Looney Tunes characters for the upcoming game. It has been a long time since I last watch Looney Tunes cartoon shows and movies and I must say that watching this movie really brings back not only the memories of growing up with it, the movie also brings back the fun and nostalgia. LeBron’s acting was pretty good. I did not expect that he can actually act as I only see him as basketball player at first. This movie proved me wrong. Don Cheadle also did great with his performance. His acting is one of the good things about this movie. As for the Looney Tunes characters, Jeff Bergman along with Eric Bauza, Zendaya, Bob Bergman, Candi Milo and Gabriel Iglesias have done a great in voicing the characters. The characters are exactly like they are supposed to be with little to no changes made to the character. The animation is great as well especially the hand drawn animation. The characters in CGI animation are also great and not too horrible to look at. Other than that, this movie also featured many other Warner Bros. IPs such as DC Universe, Hanna-Barbera, Harry Potter and more. It is pretty fun to spot all those cameos and Easter Eggs while watching. While I think this movie is fun and nostalgic, the story in this movie is not exactly great. The plot of this movie is rehashed from the first movie. The main characters trapped in a different world, a challenge to a basketball game to win their freedom and a happy ending. It is really nothing new as this movie do featured other IPs, this movie sometimes make you feel like this a product placement movie like how Michael Bay usually done with his movies. As for the humours, some might find the humours a hit while others might find it a miss. This movie may not be masterpiece but to me, it is still a fun and enjoyable movie to watch especially having grew up watching Looney Tunes. By the way, you do not need to watch the first movie to understand this one. This movie is a standalone sequel with no follow up from the original movie. If you are a fan of Looney Tunes or grew up watching the show, give the movie a chance and if you have kids, watch it together as family.","JUL 17, 2021",6.0,sport

Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby,"One More Lap. Talladega Nights: The Ballad Of Ricky Bobby McKay drives the energy of the film with his witty improv comic skills and impenetrable confidence in his silliness. I have barely witnessed any other filmmaker speak so effervescently and with conviction on the most bourgeois discussion or detail in a film. And it is that clean crisp goofiness in his film that makes it thoroughly entertaining. He is well aware of each character's background, logistics and actions. Using that very information, he draws in most of the laughs. From pointing out the vibration of the stadium or the corruption of the ticket holders, Adam McKay; the co-writer and director, never loses the grasp over his vision. And then adding the right ingredient is Will Ferrell- the writing partner of McKay- playing the role of a childish NASCAR driver Ricky Bobby whose uncouth language; something that runs on generation, is the least bit of fun you are about to get. The real laughs are drawn in when Ferrell is set loose to improvise and run the film on his own, stripping down in the middle of a car race, series of monologues that describes inappropriate endorsements and let's face it, the good old trash talk. Speaking of which, receiving the other end of the trash talk is Sacha Baron Cohen as his rival, is hilarious while racing and also keeping himself busy with other activities at the same time. Completing this dream team is John C. Reilly as the last piece of the puzzle, who with his brotherhood issues convinces you along with Ferrell to be his friend, no matter how rude he grows to him. Talladega Nights: The Ballad Of Ricky Bobby is exactly what you would expect from these group of guys, McKay's thorough investigation on the lifestyle of these bratty drivers is a satisfying and malleable sketchy ride.","FEB 23, 2019",5.0,sport

Moneyball,"I really enjoyed the movie and Brad Pitt is excellent. The problem I have with the movie is I have the disadvantage of actually knowing something about the 2002 Oakland A's. The film is dishonest because it willfully overstates the impact of a few baseball scrubs and completely ignores the great players the A's already had. Not only that it willfully misrepresents the fact that Jeremy Giambi (Jason Giambi's brother) played in 124 games for the A's the year before in 2001! He wasn't a new discovery. How could the filmmaker not even mention that the A's had one of the best pitching staffs in baseball in 2001 and they were back for 2002: Barry Zito won 23 games in 2001 and won the Cy Young Award as the league's best pitcher, Mark Mulder won 19 games, Tim Hudson won 15 games. They are literally never mentioned in the film! Miguel Tejada is barely mentioned and he was the League MVP batting over .300 with 34 home runs and 131 runs batted in. Eric Chavez is never mentioned and he hit 34 homers and drove in 109 runs. David Justice, meanwhile, was kind of a wash out and Scott Hatteberg was important to the team--but, certainly there was already a key group of players in place. Also, the concept of on base percentage was not **** the previous A's general manager Sandy Alderson was instrumental in using statistical analysis before Billy Beane arrived. And, Johnny Damon had had a terrible 2001 season, so letting him go was not without reason anyway. Also, the Minnesota Twins, who beat the A's in the playoffs, had virtually an identical small payroll and continued to be a more competitive team than the A's over the next decade. So, my main problem with the film is not to say that the ""moneyball"" approach didn't do anything for the A's--it did. But, it didn't do everything and they were not alone in using statistical analysis to discover value. But, that's Hollywood--overstating and making things black and white is their specialty. Brad Pitt is really getting to be a much better actor as he ages though--he's excellent in the movie.","OCT 22, 2011",5.0,sport

The Way Back,"Looking like it might have offered a different take on an old theme this one just misses the mark. As a study of alcoholism, it comes near to saying something but a somewhat unnecessarily grotty script lets it down. Sordid jokes and a swear-fest approach did not help in this situation. Ben Affleck was suitably morose and must have felt like he might have been mirroring parts of his own life. One of the most outstanding attributes that helped lift this work to a higher level is a sensitive and different kind of music score. For this feature, Award-nominated composer Rob Simonsen has created a thoughtful score that almost works against the normal flow (in the best possible way) His music highlights the sadness and angst being experienced by those involved. The imaginative arrangements also set this score apart to maximum effect. Maybe it’s a score looking for a better film. The basketball theme is rather tired and clichéd and having the young players mouthing such platitudes like “let’s win this f...’in game for the coach” took this script from the hoop, to the waste-basket. While it might offer something to the sporty types or those looking for a so-called up-lifter - others may have to work harder at getting much out of it. There’s some nice photography here and there, and the director tries hard but could have benefited from a smarter script.","JUL 16, 2021",4.0,sport

Although it doesn't disappoint in the dubbing (praise for the additions of Michael Caine, Eddie Izzard, John Turturro and Emily Mortimer), nor in the animation (Pixar never disappoints in this regard), the script is weak and even Michael Giacchino - one of the best composers of film scores from the last few years - delivers a work that is less than expected.

Cars 2,"As Pixar tradition dictates, Cars 2 stars with a short. Hawaiian Vacation revisits the Toy Story gang who, after Ken and Barbie are left behind from Bonnie’s summer holiday, recreate a perfect tropical idyll for the Mattel lovebirds to share their first kiss. It is pitch-perfect Pixar: a strong set-up delivered with jokes, filmmaking flair, perfect character moments — Mr. ****’ alien audition is genius — smarts and sentiment, all topped off with a post-credits payoff that works a treat. This reminder of Pixar’s high benchmark doesn’t make life any easier for Cars 2. Coming off the back of the studio’s least favourably reviewed film — it currently sits at 74 per cent at Rotten Tomatoes — and one of its lower-grossing flicks (it made $462 million worldwide so it’s all relative), the movie has built itself up into a franchise through a series of shorts and spin-off merchandise. A kind of Doc Hollywood with a NASCAR replacing Michael J. Fox, the original was that rare children’s film that suggested you ease up a bit, live life in the slow lane. This time round, things have been amped up considerably, transplanting hot rod Lightning McQueen and thicko tow truck Mater not only into a globe-trotting Grand Prix, but also into a slick espionage flick circa 1966. The two strands never really cohere, but deliver enough spy-cool, visual fizz and comedic touches to entertain. From the retro fittings of The Incredibles to WALL•E’s adoration of Hello Dolly, Pixar has always been enamoured with ’60s pop culture, and Cars 2 positively thrums with it. From Michael Giacchino’s stupidly catchy Finn McMissile guitar riffs, to a delight in gizmos and gadgetry, to impenetrable coded secret-agent greetings, this is a love letter not only to 007, but also to American counterparts like The Man From U. N. C. L. E. and Get Smart. A terrific opening set-piece sees Michael Caine’s Finn McMissile, an Aston Martin overflowing with Q Department firepower, infiltrate the baddies’ oil rig and the subsequent escape is a potent reminder that Pixar can hold its own against anybody in the action stakes. Be it a nighttime Tokyo race or a high-speed runway rumpus courtesy of Jason Isaacs’ spy plane, Cars 2 is at its best when it is on the move. It is in the bits between the action, the Pixar specialities of plot points and character beats, that the movie does less well. The narrative is admirably complicated — everyone is chasing a camera which can generate an electro-magnetic pulse that can destroy the cars mid race — but offers little in the way of surprises. There are tons of new characters but, save the Brit spy duo of McMissile and Emily Mortimer’s Holley Shiftwell and John Turturro’s Formula 1 demon Francesco Bernoulli, few register. It is also hard to remember a more talk-driven Pixar movie, but little of the dialogue crackles or pops. There are first-base jokes about cultural difference, wasabi mistaken for ice cream hijinks, over-emotional Italians and wrong-side-of-the-road gags. The relationship dynamics between McQueen and Mater are too simply drawn, the moralising, as McQueen asks his gauche friend to change to fit into the wider world, too on the nose. It’ll play perfectly for the young but, for once with Pixar, that’s all it does. As ever, there are stunning little grace notes (watch the mud speckle the camera as the race cars speed by), lovingly realised street scenes and the frame is filled with inspired visual puns. But the film never truly finds its mojo, its heartbeat. If you want a barometer of the difference between top-drawer Pixar and Cars 2, you could do worse than listen to the songs. Randy Newman’s songs for the Toy Story series are smart, charming and heartfelt. Country star Brad Paisley’s tunes are pleasant but forgettable. The former will last for the ages. The latter works well enough for now.","JAN 5, 2016",4.0,sport

Cars 2,"It’s never easy coping with the death of an icon, especially for a franchise as intimately associated with that icon as Cars was with Paul Newman. Yet in a shocking miscalculation, the usually brilliant folks over at Pixar coped with Newman’s death in the stupidest possible way—by transforming John Lasseter’s shiny love letter to the automobile into an unabashed vehicle for the hayseed comedy stylings of Larry The Cable Guy. Larry The Cable Guy’s hillbilly tow truck Mater must have sold a lot of toys and played like gangbusters for focus-group respondents, because Cars 2 makes the vehicular redneck its proud centerpiece. That leaves Owen Wilson, the film’s ostensible star, to fret about the state of his relationship with his best friend Mater. Itchy & Scratchy Studios didn’t push Poochie on audiences the way Cars 2 does Mater. Cars 2 sends Mater and Wilson’s Lightning McQueen on a globe-trotting trek to compete in an international Grand Prix that doubles as a showcase for an amazing new wonder-fuel. In Europe, Mater unwittingly lives out the plot of The Man Who Knew Too Little when he gets entangled in a web of intrigue involving a James Bond-style car voiced by Michael Caine and his more-than-capable associate Holley Shiftwell. Yes, in Cars 2, Mater even gets the girl. The first Cars was pitched at a much younger audience than the rest of Pixar’s oeuvre; the sequel is pitched even more directly at an even younger audience. It’s difficult to insert scatological humor into a film devoid of human bodily functions, but Cars 2 nevertheless manages to smuggle some in via Mater “leaking fluids” and at one point ending up in a lavatory truck. Cars 2 is so enraptured with Larry The Cable Guy’s persona that it even has Mater spout the comedian’s catchphrases, though the more Mater insists something is just funny right there, the less funny it becomes. This being Pixar, Cars 2 looks fantastic, but the studio has never given audiences—especially audiences over the age of 10—less reason to be emotionally invested in the beautiful shiny things flying across the screen. (Preceding the film is a clever short from the Toy Story universe involving Ken and Barbie’s crudely improvised Hawaiian vacation. This provides an unflattering reminder of what a really good Pixar sequel looks like.)","APR 23, 2015",4.0,sport

Moneyball,"“Moneyball” is a “based on” sports flick that endeavors to bring the Oakland A’s 2002 season to the silver screen, via the perspective of its general manager Billy Beane. While the story manages to convey the injustice of high-budget teams owning the game by proxy of their wealth, the story’s execution of Beane as a character compounded with a number of awkward thematic choices put the film several runs behind. Concerning the plot, the narrative follows Billy around as he struggles to fight against a system that is perpetually rigged against him and the team he manages: one in which the “best” players go to the teams with the deepest pockets. After stumbling upon Peter Brand, a Baseball enthusiast who judges a player’s worth solely upon their statistics, Beane concocts a plan to create a winning team made up of unwanted and undervalued players that have been overlooked for any number of reasons. Ultimately, Billy and Peter fail to bring the A’s the victory they were hoping for, but the film closes with a reminder that the strategy they employed would later go on to revolutionize the game and bring a World Series championship to another team that later used it. While this works for the overall story the film is trying to convey, there were a few points of focus that failed to connect in terms of the bigger picture. For example, the movie uses up a considerable amount of screen time covering the A’s iconic twentieth-in-a-row victory that established a new historical record. This victory is immediately undercut by Billy, however, who laments that it wouldn’t matter how many games they won should they still lose the World Series. The film subsequently follows this up by showing the game that lost them the season for all but a few seconds. In essence, the writers glossed over the point in the journey that should have been the emotional climax for a game that the main character himself disregarded as being insignificant. In terms of the characters, most are average and enjoyable. Peter maintains an optimistic perspective through much of the film, the misfit players who were given screen time were fun to watch more often than not, and Billy’s daughter brought a positive atmosphere into the scenes she took part in. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Billy. His actor’s portrayal depicts him as an insufferable, brooding idealist in the beginning of the film and he maintains this persona through to the end. Additionally, his penchant for throwing frequent tantrums, and subsequently the nearest object in the room, likened him more to petty child than a struggling and sympathetic adult. Lastly, the overall contempt and disregard he showed toward others that stood in the way of his vision was nothing short of grating. An example of this would be his actions around the A’s downtrodden coach, Art, who’s bid for a decent contract and vote of confidence are ignored and upon who’s lap the controversial group of players are dropped with no warning; effectively setting him up to fail should the experiment fall through. Though the film tries to paint Beane as a sympathetic victim through his failures in the past to perform as a player, it disregards following up on the point that he still made the decision to become one regardless of the scouting error that gave him the choice. Had his presentation been toned down a few notches, this might have been less noticeable and more forgivable in the long run. In conclusion, “Moneyball” is the middling result of a solid concept with poor execution. Sitting at over two hours in runtime with a number of scenarios that could have been reworked or integrated elsewhere, the pacing felt patted out rather than concise. Though it can doubtlessly still be watched as a “feel good” film to scratch that baseball itch, it remains a big swing and a miss from what it had the potential to be.","FEB 16, 2023",5.0,sport

It’s great to see older actresses still starring in movies. Sally’s character keeps reminding the others that she is NOT in her 80s. She tells them she’s only 75, which was her real age at the time of filming the movie. She and Jane Fonda were both nominated for an Oscar at the same time; Sally won. Jane Fonda’s hair always looks incredible. In the movie, we see that they’re all wigs. Other celebrities make an appearance such as Patton, Billy Porter, Harry Hamlin, Sara Gilbert, Jimmy O. Yang, Glynn Turman, and Guy Fieri (Lilly Tomlin’s character described him as a flaming hot Cheeto.) You’ll love seeing some of today’s big football players interact with the cast: Rob Gronkowski. Anyone would be so lucky to have friends like these who share a passion together. We get to see old clips of Tom Brady playing football, as well as see him in the current day as a member of the cast. Even if you’re not a Tom Brady fan or football fan, you’ll still get a kick out of this loving tribute to true sports fans, as well as aging with grace and hope like the women in the movie. There’s a scene where one of the characters trades jerseys with Tom Brady. He makes a comment about how he can’t find his, which is a reference to when his jersey was stolen in real life after a Super Bowl game. There are some cute jokes that mostly older people will laugh at. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: The plot is paper thin and predictable. Not all of the humor lands. TIPS FOR PARENTS: Some profanity and 1 F-bomb. There are a lot of sexual innuendoes. Kids will be bored.","OCT 26, 2023",6.0,sport

Space Jam: A New Legacy,"Space Jam A New Legacy: I’m not going to let this review be tarnished because of what LeBron has done or what he believes in. But I will judge his acting and it’s honestly one of the factors that brings this movie down they even make a joke that athletes don’t make good actors. But the animation 2D or CGI look fantastic the gorgeous animation look fantastic from the last 25 years which is a no brainer. But I have to lack the movie in certain ways one like all reviewers say it basically is a huge Warner Bros commercial with countless Easter eggs in the background of the basketball game, which can be very distracting at times. Two is Lola Bunny she is not played by a dedicated voice actress she’s played by Zendaya. Not that I have a problem with her but when you have all the other original Looney Tunes voice actors coming back why not let Lola have hers it takes me out when she talks. Don Cheadle is giving his all though sometimes it a bit much at least he’s having fun. Overall this is a movie little kids will love but aside from the gorgeous 2D and CGI animation LeBron and Zendaya kinda sink the film down for me. I do love the Looney Tunes performances though and the basketball ball game is a long one around half hour which gives so many great CGI my favorite is the Water guy on the Goon Squad. Ranking Ok. .","MAR 7, 2022",4.0,sport
Draft Day,"Draft Day is a suspenseful sports drama without the sports, relying on the business and management side of sports teams. The film uses unique editing techniques to help build tension for a topic that only appeals to a very niche audience. Although the script employs additional themes outside the realm of sports, the story never brings itself to the level needed to have these themes stand on their own. The characters are more plot devices than actual breathing people in a film that goes well beyond its needed run time. The highlight of the film is Kevin Costner, who always seems to shine in his many sports films. This film hopes to leach off the success of the statistic-heavy and critically-acclaimed sports drama Moneyball, but becomes lost with the lack of a believable storyline, strong themes and an inviting hook for a general audience. Draft Day scrambles for the ball, never truly finding control and instead of scoring a touchdown it gets sidelined for the season.","NOV 2, 2014",6.0,sport

The Big Blue,"A slow and strange film that we will call poetic to reassure ourselves but which nonetheless remains corny. Luc Besson is certainly accustomed to this (the cinema of his beginnings before he sank into the production of turnips with Statham) but in this Big Blue, we are still looking for the possible qualities which would counterbalance this too pronounced cutesy side. We completely understand why he wanted to offer his “dance with the dolphins” but his characters sorely lack depth and credibility in their reactions and behavior. The only explanation lies in the repeated lack of oxygenation of their brains from diving into this entire fleet like gogols. One wants to see mermaids and yet he only sees dolphins... so he mistakes bladders for lanterns. The other has a gigantic swelling of the ego and represents the caricature of the slap-faced Italian, which explains that. Then Rosanna - who is as good as a mermaid but with the brains of a blonde - runs in vain after Monsieur Dauphin. Note, however, that she has the head of a pickled herring but that with a bag on her head, it looks okay. Well produced despite its general slowness, The Big Blue at least benefits from the beautiful music of Eric Serra which unknowingly contributes to plunging us further into an abysmal torpor. What if in the end, Luc Besson had got the title wrong? indeed, Le Grand Sommeil seems much more suitable...","JAN 17, 2017",4.0,sport
Ford v Ferrari,"The first 45 minutes of the film descend into Phantom Menace-tier lunacy, with too many characters introduced and too many events rushed through far too quickly. The rest of the movie plays out like a much more grounded, realistic ""Days of Thunder"" - which sounds good on paper, but in reality makes them film extremely cliche and bland. The cars are the stars of the final half, but after so many low, sweeping shots of the GT, you feel like you're watching a Ford ad.","NOV 14, 2019",5.0,sport
Gran Turismo,"What else could we expect than an average movie? The scenario especially falls flat in an ocean of pre-heated predictability and the only thing that - almost - saves it is the fact that it is based on a true story. From the start, you can clearly see where the plot is going to end and how. This last statement is only partially true since the middle of the film sees some relatively unpredictable events going on. But it doesn't last long before we go back to those classic linear rails again. Driving skills are a mess since Jann has no strategy at all. The filmmaking is quite cool, as some shots deserve the detour in my opinion. Some are interestingly evoking the games, but never too much. Mea culpa, I am just way too keen and in awe about racing movies to put a lower score. Actors are okay but wow how did Orlando Bloom get so old? It is already a whole thing for him to appear in such a movie. Opponents (as well as allies) are just empty shells. Visuals are terrific, some shots are a bit 3Dish disgusting but disappear quite quickly. Terrific cars, terrific circuits and environments. Thrilling fast paced action. The soundtrack is insane from the iconic start with 'Parenthesis' from Kenny Beats (from his 'LOUIE' album which easily deserves a 10/10). On the other hand great Kenny G introduction. This made my buy Forza Horizon 4 the day after... I guess their marketing objectives were not that completed.","AUG 24, 2023",6.0,sport

Eddie the Eagle,"I really want to love Eddie The Eagle, I really do, but at this point I can just say it’s an OK movie. It’s biggest strength is the central performance from Taron Egerton which excels the film,I just don’t think this is the film for me. I’m getting a bit bored of sports film cliches and I think this film has cemented that for me. It had some good humour in it, there is some decent acting and the period accuracy is pretty well done, but I know this film could have been so much better. This film could have been the ‘feel good british comedy of the year’, but as it stands, it’s just one to play at Christmas when there is not much else on. I think this film will appeal much more to people that experienced this event in the 80’s and want a bit more of an in depth analysis of what actually happened. I can only really recommend this film to those people, anyone born from 1990 onwards, probably should skip it. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t hate this movie, it’s just OK and I was highly entertained watching it, just not as much as I would have liked to have been.","APR 2, 2016",6.0,sport
Waves,"This film follows the life of a family living in Miami, Florida as they pursue love and dreams, until they're **** and nearly torn apart by an unexpected and sudden tragedy. This film definitely had a lot going for it. A great cast (with actors like Sterling K. Brown and Lucas Hedges to name a couple), and an intriguing story setup. However, the story felt highly unbalanced some times, and excessively melodramatic other times. The first half really begins to deteriorate for me as the drama gradually increased and the likability of certain characters decreased. I found the second half only slightly better, as the melodrama continues well into the rest of the film from this point but does offer some touching and hopeful moments. As far as characters go, there were only really a few likable characters the film had to offer. There were some interesting cinematography choices, even if there were a few too many scenes of the camera spinning around in circles. Furthermore, I'm torn as to whether I should praise the somewhat interesting use of many different aspect ratios throughout the film that really helped change and set the tone for a lot of scenes or whether it felt random and gimmicky (because it honestly did feel that way sometimes.) Overall, the film does have a powerful message to share about the bonds we share with family and loved ones, as well as the choices we make, and the pitfalls and mistakes in life that may impact those around us for better or worse, but the film's style and approach simply felt too jumbled and uncertain of itself for my liking and I was mostly left frustrated and underwhelmed by the end of it all.","DEC 6, 2019",5.0,sport

The team who received those picks would in no way, shape or form give those picks back! I give this a 6 because I think it showed how up and down a GM can be in one day, but I think there are alot bigger issues going on. Players calling because they are worried that they took drugs, or got someone pregnant.. If there were behind the scences story lines like that, than I think a movie like this will make 100+ million. Looking at the numbers, it looks like this picture cost $50m to make and after 2 weeks it has only made $20m.

The girls that play Serena and Venus are fine too, and the resemblance is striking. But Aunjanue Ellis steals the show as Brandy, a mother who will protect her children at any cost, even of their abusive father. I liked the fact that the film doesn't try to fully sanitize the image of Richard Williams; and even though there's some kind of redemption at the end, I left the theater hating his actions.

While the film's humor might not always work, some of the acting isn't always convincing and features a handful of awkward moments scattered throughout the film's runtime, there isn't anything too bad or offensive about the film to write off completely.

Cars 2,"Of all Pixar's alti-verses, the one in Cars is the hardest to buy into. Motors with eyes for windshields, pootling about a four-wheeled world modeled on auto parts? It may be John Lasseter's pride and joy, but for us it's missing some key components. Internal logic for one. Charm. Car-isma... Ok, so the 2006 original eventually won us over with its fish-out-of-water storyline and its nostalgic passion for Americana. But not so much that we were craving another outing for Lightning McQueen and his tow-truck mate Mater, hardly the Butch and Sundance of the animated fraternity. Seemingly guessing as much, the Emeryville elite seek to woo us with a pre-feature short, Hawaiian Vacation, that joyously reunites the Toy Story gang. Sadly, like a clapped-out banger, this gambit backfires. We love Buzz and Woody, while we merely tolerate Mater and McQueen. Why waft champagne under our noses when we are really getting Car-va? To be fair, Cars 2 begins well with a Bondian prologue which sees suave superspy Finn McMissile - voice Michael Caine, body DB5 - sneak onto an offshore oil platform at the centre **** gasoline conspiracy. Goldfinger gags abound in the ensuing mayhem, raising hopes that Lasseter has heeded the critics and upped the ante accordingly. But once the action defaults to Radiator Springs, the movie springs a leak, mostly by putting clueless hick Mater centre stage. Yes, it is Owen Wilson's hotshot racer who gets invited to compete in a World Grand Prix that whisks him to Japan (Geishas, neon), Italy (Popemobile) and Britain (Big Bentley, Tyre Bridge). But it's Mater who gets embroiled in McMissile's mission, a convoluted caper involving alternative fuel, millionaire mogul Miles Axlerod (Eddie Izzard) and rookie agent Holley Shiftwell (Emily Mortimer). Mater scuppering an assassination attempt in a Tokyo restroom. Mater careering around an international airport. Mater infiltrating a villain convention in elaborate disguise. Yes, we sure do get a lot of the bumbling rust-bucket this time around, testing our patience for Larry the Cable Guy's hillbilly schtick to braking point. True, the picture is punctuated by three thrilling race meets that find McQueen and tutti-frutti nemesis Francesco Bernoulli (John Turturro) justifying the now obligatory 3D as they negotiate spectacular Scalextric-style courses. What should be highlights though have more than a clutch of afterthought, particularly during an extended London-set climax more interested in the plastic attached to Mater's carburettor (some days you just can't get rid of a bomb!) than who gets to the finish line first. Cars' popularity with the kids ensures a large and enthusiastic audience will turn up for the sequel. Yet where Pixar's other films have captivated across the board, Cars 2 could leave some grown-ups feeling tired. There's more going on than there was in Cars and the globe-trotting's a gas. But compared to the pick of the Pixar pack, this is some way down the grid.","JAN 3, 2016",4.0,sport

King Richard,"The title itself tells you specifically who this story will be centered around. It's not something I have a problem with, because after all, what Richard Williams did is completely inspirational. He aspired to greatness for his daughters, even as difficult and strict as it can be said that his upbringing was for them. It's more than clear that the person who created you, who molded you, is a fundamental part of who you are, and it's even more noticeable when you have become such a great, monumental figure in sports as Venus and Serena Williams are. Especially when that person is your own father. Your own blood. And King Richard is a film that is dedicated to demonstrating that for most of its running time thanks to that fictional idealism that cinema indulges in real stories like this one. But even in the face of how uplifting and moving its story can be, and even with the outstanding performance of a Will Smith who is clearly aiming for an academy award nomination, both Venus and Serena are the real figures here, and when their journey is just beginning, this overlong film comes to an end. It gives the feeling of a cliffhanger for a sequel that I want to believe will never happen. Don't get me wrong, I liked this film, even with all the emotional manipulation that goes with it, but personally, I think the ones who should have gotten all the attention are the two women who have already etched their names in the history of their sport, and sports in general, not necessarily the man who drove them to achieve for success.

At least the story is told in a nonlinear way, center in the life at home with flashback to the war. Basically the struggle is the same as American Sniper, but with a young protagonist, without a clue of what he is doing with his life and a family mess. So you don’t get to see big consequences in his actual life choices, but instead just glimpses of trauma. There are two interesting things in this film, the technical way in which the war catches up to the protagonist and the truth about the show business that takes advantage of these poor traumatized soldiers. The movie is stimulating, definitely, but it’s more of the same topic. Ang Lee stays certainly in debt.","FEB 1, 2017",6.0,sport

The Karate Kid Part III,"Basically they redo a lot of elements from the first movie with a few added new elements but it is less immersive and impactful. It is a lot weaker than the previous movies which is a shame as I like some of the ideas. Also the antagonist are overdone. They are often over the top bad guys that feel out of place (But it has also some entertainment value;-). While I said that it is weaker it is not garbage either. I think it is more unremarkable and not refreshing enough. The introduction deals with what happens to John Kreese after the first movie. After this set up Daniel and Mr. Miyagi return home from Okinawa after the events of the prequel. However things have changed as Daniel is now homeless and Mr. Miyagi unemployed because of a reconstruction of the apartment complex (Daniel lives there and Mr. Miyagi was the janitor). Meanwhile the antagonist start their schemes. I stop her with the introduction. It falls into the realm of stories that I can retell and it sounds amazing. Sadly the actual experience is weaker. It feels often like a retelling of elements from the first movie but water down to a weaker experience. There are some silly and some over the top moments that harm the immersion and enjoyment. I used often the fast forward function as it gets too boring otherwise. I like the themes they try to use but these are also harmed by the excessive performances and overuse of tropes. Let go to the actors. Pat Morita as Mr. Miyagi always delivers. He again is a true Sensei and role model. His performances is a saving grace of the movie. Ralph Macchio as Daniel LaRusso feels like he was downgraded from the last movie. Good performance in a weaker script for him. For the antagonists Martin Kove as John Kreese, Sean Kanan as Mike Barnes and Thomas Griffith as Terry Silver: I already said they are over the top but it is still somehow hilariously entertaining. It would be better if they were smarter magnificent ****. All in all I think the performance is not that bad in this regard. It is the script that cheapens the experience. Maybe they ran out of ideas or they chose the first available script. Overall this is a weak experience and I fully see why many (rightfully so) say it is a pale imitation of the first movie. You can skip this without missing anything as even Pat Moritas good performance is not redeeming enough. It is the weakest movie of the franchise and they tried a restart with the next movie.","APR 15, 2021",4.0,sport

Balls of Fury,"This movie is basically (as my review title indicates) one massive long parody or p-take on movies such as the Karate Kid, whereby a (fairly) young and out of shape guy (Randy) is taken under an old, wise Asian mans wing and somehow is miraculously trained so that he can compete well and stand up for himself against much more competent looking people. Of course there's the token attractive lady, Maggie, who Randy wants to impress but who initially has no interest in him whatsoever and yes, I'd say if I continue you can probably guess the majority of the movies plot by yourself, its hardly rocket science. There's little point in being very serious as far as reviewing this movie is concerned because the movie is so silly, I think silly is about the best way to describe it generally. Its basically scene after scene of corny visual jokes, similar to the Police Academy movies and other such spoof movies. In this movie, the jokes/comedy are all pretty basic, their not particularly clever or original really. That's not to say that you can't laugh at any of it, just its rather over the top I feel. Of course with Christopher Walken in it, you should expect it to be rather over the top and indeed he does play the most extravagent character, the evil villain Feng but its not just him thats over the top and silly, just about all of the characters are in their own way. In fact, I'd compare the movie to a comic book, in that I could imagine kids reading the story in a comic book format, that would probably work quite well. To be honest, it depends on what you enjoy, what kind of comedy you like and what you expect from the movie, as to whether or not you'd like it or find it entertaining. I knew roughly what it was about from the outset, having enjoyed a similar movie called Blades of Glory, so I wasn't too disappointed because I knew what to expect and I hadn't paid anything to see it anyway (it was recently shown on TV). Partly because of that, I did actually enjoy it - I wouldn't say I found it really hilarious, its pretty corny but I still thought some scenes were amusing and laughed a few times out of the absurdity of the story, I suppose. Of course its not believable but some of the characters are so silly, I guess I did feel a bit attached to them and I thought it was entertaining enough to see how they reacted to the different, over the top situations they found themselves in, so it kept me watching. I can't deny that I watched it right through to the end and I thought overall it was fairly amusing in parts and entertaining enough to pass the time. Basically it was what I expected of it, a zany, over the top parody with some funny characters and some laughs but thats about it. If it weren't for Walkens portrayal of the token bad guy, I don't think this would be anything like as memorable as it is - which isn't greatly memorable to start with but his character stands out most for the fancy costumes he wears. Its all just a bit too silly I'd imagine and plenty of people who may sit down and watch the first half hour should it appear again on TV would roll their eyes and want to switch over but I'll guess that the target market, presumably teenage boys, would get a few laughs and find it entertaining enough for them, if it interests them - its good to pass the time if its the sort of thing you like and you know what to expect, otherwise don't bother. All in all, no I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to purchase this, although as I say if you're interested in it, you know what to expect and its on TV again then by all means, catch it as you may get a few laughs from it and find it entertaining enough to pass the time (its a fairly short movie at an hour and a half long). Given the kind of movie it is and how its marketed etc., its not awful, its just perhaps a bit too basic for some, yet I still felt I enjoyed watching it, so its up to you to decide whether or not to bother catching this or not. I don't feel its a really poor movie, it doesn't claim to be anything other than a spoof/parody comedy movie, which is what it is, so fair enough, if you know what I mean, so I'll go with a 5 out of 10 rating for this movie.","NOV 27, 2021",5.0,sport

Next Goal Wins,"When Taika Waititi (Jojo Rabbit, Thor: Ragnarok) writes and directs a movie, you can expect a unique approach to the subject. In this case, he's taken the true story of the American Samoa soccer team, who most famously lost in the FIFA with a score of 31-0. They hire a new coach who's disgraced back in the states (Michael Fassbender) to help turn them around. The typical plot points are there (training montage, personnel setbacks, earnest pep talks) and sometimes Waititi has managed to add some quirk to the characters or situations. While there aren't a lot of outright laughs, there's a lighthearted spirit and upbeat attitude that makes this underdog sports story enjoyable. Two interesting notes:1. This team was the first to have a trans player.2. The coach's daughter went to VCU and he wears a logo hat during the game.NOTE: Stay thru the credits for one final gag from the director.","NOV 20, 2023",6.0,sport
Battle of the Sexes,"""Little Miss Sunshine"" co-directors Valerie Faris and Jonathan Dayton blast us back to the past with ""Battle Of The Sexes,"" a period drama that coasts smoothly on the backs of its two, incredible lead performances, but also falters in trying to spread itself a bit too thin narratively, thematically, and in terms of perspective. Its heart is most definitely in the right place though, and even with its overly serious take on everything involved with the 1973 match in question, its the earnestness of it all that ultimately makes it all watchable in the end.","OCT 9, 2017",6.0,sport

Gran Turismo,"Gran Turismo can proudly boast of offering a healthy dose of modest and unambitious entertainment. However, when considering the overall concept, the film exudes a sense of detachment, coldness and a vexing absence of emotional depth. While the on-screen storyline draws from reality, I find that the protagonist's career trajectory seems to align more with the mechanics of a video game rather than capturing the true nuances of real life. This creates a barrier that affects the ultimate achievement of his success. It's not that the protagonist didn't work hard to achieve his position, but rather that his struggle and training lacks the palpable sense of true dedication and sacrifice. Once again, Neill Blomkamp proves that he is a director with vision, and despite the film being under the tight reins of the studio system, it displays a fine level of craftsmanship. However, the script is clearly where the film falters and is what has been his biggest weakness since District 9. Although it should be noted that this film does distance itself significantly from the mediocre ""Demonic"" of 2021. Undoubtedly the worst film of his career and by far. If you're looking for some lighthearted fun without the burden of deeper contemplation, you're unlikely to be disappointed with Gran Turismo. Nevertheless, if you try to dig deeper, the more you explore, the more obvious its shortcomings will become.","AUG 24, 2023",6.0,sport
Warrior,"This is a sports centered drama film with themes covered including tournaments, martial arts and underdogs. From the start, the family members are depicted as very much being quite distant from one another, with one being clearly a lot more down and out than the other. With quite dour and solemn music playing in the background, its also clear that their both relatively tired (physically, mentally and quite possibly emotionally speaking) as well. There is a certain atmosphere present from this first initial scene, although it sets the tone as being quite bleak, understandably so but I suppose I should say that it isn't the best of films to see if your looking for a constantly wonderfully happy film, put it that way!. The camerawork is a bit jerky at times - the scenes featuring said martial arts being practiced or during competitions/tournaments are quite frenetic, with many camera angles used. It has quite a gritty, urban feel to it. At times a split screen is used to show one of the brothers training, in the ring, while another is out running. The chronology of the film appears to be quite wide, with it quickly depicting many days or weeks worth of time, hence the pace is relatively quick. Its fair to say that the plot isn't exactly greatly original - there are some cliches present, with it being a sports related drama film with a heavy emphasis on family and the toll that being a sportsperson can have on you but it is a fairly tense and watchable film regardless. There are clearly unanswered questions from relatively early on but, somewhat frustratingly, as a viewer we're not really made aware of the full background of the brothers and what may have entirely driven such a big wedge between them. Having said that, it did make me feel a bit intrigued and curious to see what we might learn as the plot developed. The characterisation is fairly good but I found myself feeling that it was perhaps a little over 'Hollywood-ised', in that it didn't come across as entirely realistic and believable. There seemed to be an air of exaggerated melodrama somehow, although I'm not sure I can entirely put my finger on it. Cast wise, Joel Edgerton plays Brendan Conlon, while his brother Tommy is played by Tom Hardy and the father, Paddy Conlon, is played by Nick Nolte. They do certainly look the part of gritty, hard done by street fighters trying to get by but I felt I somehow didn't quite buy in to the full picture. Other cast members include Jennifer Morrison, as Tess Conlon and Frank Grillo, as Frank Campana. Nolte's performance was probably the most noteable for me overall. I found myself confused by the plot and not able to keep track of precisely what was going on, during pivotal scenes. At times the plot pace is quite fast and slick, while at other times it seemed a little slow. I feel the script wasn't the best overall. There is definitely a depressing bleakness to it but in a way I suppose thats a good thing, as I imagine thats what the filmmakers were trying to convey. I also found myself noticing a role reversal element which was interesting for a while but I won't give any spoilers. The basic concept is nothing new, although in this day and age (politically/culturally/economically speaking) its maybe more relevant than ever, the whole 'people trying to make a name for themselves, to rise above their circumstances' etc. but with various scenes taking place in Las Vegas and there being aerial camera shots used, panning across the many Vegas casinos and other establishments at night, with their lights shining bright, there was a definite tacky-ness to it. There is something sadly profoundly depressing about aspects of this but its not as if it hasn't been done before, numerous times. Content wise, the film contains one or two brief sex references and very brief/partial nudity, plus obviously violence in terms of the martial arts tournaments. There is also strong language and a character is depicted as being an alcoholic, with heavy drink use depicted, although its not really glamorised as such. No, I wouldn't particualrly recommend this film. There are plenty of other, similar films around - I just didn't think this one was especially memorable.","NOV 26, 2021",6.0,sport

David Spade and Rob Schneider have worked with Sandler on numerous occasions. Spade and Jon Heder were fairly funny throughout the film, but Schneider does not work as the sensible guy.

McG is the director for this film and we all know what kind of track record he has with films like Terminator Salvation and Charlie's Angels Full Throttle. We Are Marshall is more of the same. The film starts out well with tragedy but the script does not allow the viewer to get behind the team. The script relies far to much on characters that really don't matter rather than just stick with the football team. Matthew McConaughey and Matthew Fox are both decent in this movie and they are certainly the highlights of a fairly talented cast including a young Kate Mara and Anthony Mackie.

Cars 2 is the only sequel that received a rotten rating from all other rating websites; and the question is, Why? It is because of its carelessly handled storytelling that's so complicated to understand that it wants to become like the greatest action movie you never before seen on animation -- intended to become like a James Bond film or any spy film. So because of that bad storytelling. We can see now that Pixar somehow loses magic and credibility in crafting innovative, original, and outstanding stories which we have seen from its past Academy Award winning films like those of Finding Nemo, Ratatouille, Wall-E, Up, and Toy Story 3. No heartfelt or improving drama, no cleverly crafted gags. Cars 2, fairly, does not belong to the list of the worst animations produced on screen but it is rendered as a mediocre film.

The Next Karate Kid,"Because the last movie of the franchise failed at the box office and was disliked by many fans and critics they tried a fresh restart with a new story-line. Of cause they do not replace Pat Morita as Mr. Miyagi as this would be much too harmful. He is the focus point of the franchise and Daniel LaRusso’s story can be considered finished as he has mastered the critical (life) lessons in the last 3 movies (Until Cobra Kai at least;-). I am in the minority that thinks this is a quite good movie with some mistakes that drag it down. Also I think the first movie which is a cult classic set the bars to high for all the prequels. Sometimes there is a peak that is nearly impossible to surpass or even reach. Again the movie uses themes from an underdog story, teenage drama, clashing philosophies and martial arts. The story starts with Mr. Miyagi traveling to Boston to attend a commendation for Japanese-American soldiers. He visits Louisa Pierce who is the widow of his friend and former commanding officer. He meets Julie who is his friends granddaughter and struggles because of dealing with her parents death. He decides to help her which is the start of a new adventure. The set up is nice and fitting. The later parts are weaker with some exceptions. I would say they try their best but could not reach the appropriate levels to make this a hit or like the first movie. It is not a failure more a case of to much use of the fast forward button for the viewer. Character wise we got good and bad performances. For Hilary Swank this was her first big role and breakthrough. She got recognition and many praised her performance. I agree to that as she fully delivered her role and is a highlight of the movie. Pat Morita as Mr. Miyagi is a staple of the franchise. Always delivering a truly good performance. I cant remember a weak moment in all movies. I am divided for Michael Ironside as Paul Dugan. He does a good job but his character does not fit that good into the movie. Maybe a bit to overdone or cliche (or not enough if you go more into parody territory). I like the monks, Louisa Pierce played by Constance Towers and Michael Cavalieri as Ned Randall with some bad scenes. In total it is a solid performance but in combination with the script there are too many weaknesses. To be fair other were far more critical here and I see their points. Maybe I am far less critical but I can not prove that my opinion is more valuable than theirs and vice versa. Overall the movie was not strong enough to safe the franchise. I liked it but it has some weaknesses that drag it down. I think that I enjoy the two main characters saved the movie for me.

Early Man,"If you've seen other Nick Park films then you'll know roughly what to expect - somewhat eccentric characters and a fairly quirky plot line delivered via stop motion animation, wich is very much family friendly viewing. This all applies to this film, so there's no change there. I didn't find it as amusing as the Wallace & Gromit films but then I suppose thats maybe a lot for this to live up to, not least as the characters are brand new (or really old, if you know what I mean - pardon the plot related pun). Its an easy and enjoyable watch, with some pretty good examples of visual, slapstick comedy. I thought the voice acting was quite good but as I say it doesn't really compare to the studios previous works. I liked that the cave men were clearly portrayed as having their own flaws, which, no doubt, on a serious note, they would have had. I tend to enjoy the quirky/zaniness factor and the tongue-in-cheek sense that Nick Park films have and this film is no exception. I wouldn't say, however, that this is more memorable compared to other such films. However, I should point out that its very much football focussed, plot wise, so the football theme/references could get a bit boring if your not a fan of the sport, though it is pretty lighthearted and, suffice to say, not intended to be taken especially seriously (seriously, can you imagine cave people engaging on football matches?).

King Richard,"""King Richard is a workmanlike, formulaic, feel-good sports drama. That's regrettable, because it could have been so much more. The story describes the early development of tennis superstars Venus and Serena Williams. Most of the action takes place in the years immediately preceding Venus’ professional debut in October, 1994, at the age of fourteen. But rather than focus on these obvious subjects, the film centers on Richard Williams, their father, coach, protector and generally omnipresent figure. For those who have followed the professional careers of the Williams sisters, Richard has always been an enigmatic figure. His coaching style was unorthodox. His talent for self-promotion (sometimes on behalf of his daughters, sometimes not) was legendary. His conflicts with the tennis establishment over slights real and imagined were similarly well-known. It’s regrettable that this film never fully explores its fascinatingly complex central character. The roles of Venus and Serena as executive producers of this movie may have contributed to this sanitized approach that, as several critics rightly suggest, borders on hagiography. Richard (Will Smith) is consistently portrayed as an admirable figure fiercely protective of all five of his daughters as they are growing up in Compton, a Los Angeles neighborhood that’s still among the ten most dangerous cities in the country. He is equally deeply involved in the development of Venus and Serena into elite tennis players and in ensuring they are respectfully treated in their early business deals. What’s missing is even minimal acknowledgement of Richard’s dark side. For example, the fact that Richard fathered and abandoned the five children he had with his first wife receives only a glancing blow in the best scene of the film. That he and Oracene divorced eight years after Venus’ pro debut doesn’t merit comment in the large collection of vanity cards at the end of the film. His third marriage to a woman one year older than Venus goes similarly unremarked. Despite these reservations, the cast makes this movie worth recommending. Many pundits project a Best Actor Oscar for Will Smith for his efforts here. For my money, Smith’s ability to portray limitless self-absorption is more art imitating life than an Oscar-worthy exploration of new territory. That said, the rest of the cast is excellent.

Looking on the bright side, at least the animation is still pretty good (Pixar never fails in that regard), as is the voice acting (although not all of the new characters are charismatic enough).","JUL 21, 2023",6.0,sport
Early Man,"Superb and delightful animation, and a few quite funny moments. Yet I am not convinced by the story - to be fair I came with quite high expectations (Wallace & Gromit has always been brilliant). The idea of football match between stone age and bronze age in my opinion turned out being kind of dull and the story partly was cliched(prophecy, big football battle in the end, etc.). I think that an aardman film set in the stone age could potentially have been way more enthralling and humourous. I was mildly disappointed.","JUL 24, 2018",6.0,sport
Planes: Fire & Rescue,"Going into the latest Disney tent-pole, and the sequel to last summer’s snooze fest (Even by kiddie fare standards), “Planes: Fire & Rescue” I had my fair share of low, and I mean, low expectations. The trailers build this up to be one big sap fest, the first preview had the very good Spencer Lee singing the titular song “Still I Fly”. Which, yes makes it’s way into a slow montage in the film. To be expected, the film is not in the high winds of what it’s animation department is actually capable off. (Have you seen “Frozen?”) . Parents will find the film utterly predictable, but the younger children will more than likely be put in a trance, as soon as Dusty Crophopper swings into the big screen. To say the least I was truly surprised at how much I actually enjoyed this follow up sequel. Having only been less than a year since we saw the last Planes, Dusty is now a big time celebrity, and world champion. However when his gearbox reluctantly fails -- this causes Dusty to find a new calling, as he most likely will never race again. After a terrible accident leaves his hometown in ruins Dusty takes new leave, and begins investing into the world of firefighting. Serving alongside the heroes he aspires to be. You may not believe it at first, but there actually is some touching moments sprinkled throughout “Planes: Fire and Rescue”, not to mention, most of the scenery is gorgeous to look at (a vast improvement over the first outing). The directing staff actually studied for months on the actual depths that these firefighters go through. Which truly is showcased in the very cool air stunt sequences, which are easily the film’s greater strengths. Ideally, what propelled the film even further was the addition of a new band of characters, that are superior to the previous entry. Characters that I actually cared about. Of course, with new characters comes with a new cast..lead by Julie Brown (Modern Family) as Lil’ Dipper. Ed Harris, Wes Studi, Hal Holbrook while Dane Cook returned to voice Dusty. So much went wrong with the first “Planes” that it actually set a low bar for the standards of Disney, and for that I was truly shocked. It has become apparent that this crew saw those faults and drastically altered them. Resulting in a more than passable escapism for the younger **** even slight enjoyment for the adults as well. The film is nowhere near the likes of “LEGO Movie”, “Frozen”, or “How To Train Your Dragon 2”. Running at a smooth 1hr and 15 mins, is just perfect enough to entertain the **** not drag down the parents along the way.

McFarland USA,"There have been many movies about a misfit team of underdogs and this one is so firmly fixed in the formula that almost every plot point is predictable. Kevin Costner plays a coach, who's made so many mistakes that the only job he can find is in the titular town that's dominated by Mexican farm workers. When he discovers how tough and fast the students are, he forms a cross country track team. Usually, each team member has a personality, but this one only revolves around 2. It's also missing any humor, which would have added warmth. The only thing that sets this one apart is the focus on the Latino culture. Even though it is earnest (and based on a true story), it hits all of the clichés.","FEB 25, 2015",4.0,sport
Nacho Libre,"A warm comedy about a cook at an orphanage who dreams about becoming a wrestling star. Right from the start, this movie grasps its time and it takes a while to get used to the pacing but after the 2nd watch the still shots and Easter eggs in the background are fun to notice. What I hated. There isn't much I hated but I feel that this movie was padded out to be a motion picture. Nacho Libre is 92 minutes long but cutting the beginning and end credits, it's more of a 80 minute film. This doesn't even count all the still shots and characters taking their sweet time walking (driving) or looking into the camera. This movie isn't bad but it does feel that it could have been a bit longer but maybe this was due to budget reasons? (25M Budget.) What I loved. This movie is quotable. ""I want to weeeeeen!"" and ""Get that corn out of my face!"" are hilarious. Nacho is well spirited and the support cast also did a good job. This movie also has a great soundtrack. It's just such a shame that it also suffers from the same pacing that the movie has us running on. (20-30 milers per hour.) I feel that the story needed to be a bit longer and this movie is in no way trash at all for being short but I can't help have this feeling of emptiness through out the whole movie. Even the end was abrupt. I do recommend a free watch (Netflix) and a 2nd watch if enjoyed. It's not for everyone but I can't ignore the good time this film gave me. I give Nacho Libre a 6 out of 10.

Goal! The Dream Begins,Half believable and half not. Genuinely the plot may happen to a point but I extremely doubt it would go so far. You can spot what will happen by picking up the box. It was just far too predictable that any of the tension was **** out of the movie. The Cameo appearances are meant to be WOW moments but really they are not. I did not care. The film was pointless and really did not have any emotional depth to it. The actors playing footballers you can see are terrible football players and the plot is as thin as paper.

I grew up with the original film and have enjoyed its campiness time and again over the years, but I think even fans of that will find it kinda difficult to enjoy this one, as it more or less follows the first film beat by beat, but that isn't even the worst part of this. The worst part is that this entire film is essentially one long Warner Bros. commercial, throwing shameless Warner product placement, films, and characters left and right in not-so-creative or clever ways. Lebron James makes the most of what he's given, but even he looks bored and underwhelmed through most of this. Overall, does it have its moments of color and spectacle? Sure, but that's all this film really has going for it, and that can't overcome a contrived and uninspired story that lacks the heart and charm of the original.","JUL 15, 2021",4.0,sport

I expected better editing and structure to the film and the film has a very peculiar build up to the final climb, I understand that the camera crew didn't know when he was going to do it but I also expect hindsight to play a part in the final product. Clearly the man in question has a lot of issues and so does the film. The film doesn't really do justice to the high stakes this man went through to reach the top because in the first minute of the film we see him reach the top! Whoever decided to do that is possibly the single worst person to have worked on this movie. Obviously I wanted him to reach the top but I also wanted to experience watching him doing it with the tension everyone else felt when they saw him do it in real life. Why ruin the film? why? Everything he did that was high risk now became underwhlming because you now he did it successfully already. If you make a documentary that records something so extraoordinary as what this man has done and you have to remind yourslef of how incredible it is, someone along the line of this production has slipped and plummeted to the death of their film making career.","FEB 19, 2019",6.0,sport
Facing the Giants,I found this movie from searching through good football movies a couple days ago. Then I saw this one and read reviews and having the review talk about how this movie displays a lot of Christianity I jumped on it knowing I had to do a religion movie review. So I watched half the movie on Friday and the other half today (Saturday). I would definitely recommend people to watch this movie as it gives some goof information about Christianity and what that religion can do for people. Also this movie incorporates football in it to make the movie less boring and it definitely helped to send the message of the movie through. The message of the movie was that with God everything is possible. My personal opinion on the movie was that it was decent but not good. It overplayed Christianity. They gave some false information and made it seem like Christianity could solve any problem in the world. But the movie did get it’s point across through a fun movie to watch and I did gain some knowledge about how Christianity can affect people’s lives.,"MAY 30, 2013",6.0,sport
Looking for Eric,"This film has its good points, but also quite a few annoyances, too many for me to praise it highly. It tells the tale of a regular Mancunian named Eric Bishop, a postal worker who is struggling with a bunch of issues, like a drunk driving arrest and a couple of sons (from 2 different mothers) who are not on the ball, and is still carrying a torch for his ex. One of his sons is Black and looks nothing like his father, but this is not delved into at all. The main character (well played by Steve Evets) finds himself under the guidance of Manchester United's star striker, who appears to him in his bedroom and offers masculine wisdom and guidance. Among the annoyances are the gloomy cinematography, the constant nervous energy displayed by the hero, and the overly dramatized occurrences like the blooming post-marriage romance and the run-ins with local gangsters, led by a character named Meatball.","MAY 20, 2020",6.0,sport

Happy Gilmore,"There isn no denying that the steam roller success story that is the career of Adam Sandler has had an impact on the comedy genre for the past 20 years. Whether loved or loathed, this guy has made a fortune attempting to make people laugh, Happy Gilmore, while juvenile, crude, promoting violence for laughs and being utterly brainless, is quite a hysterical and side-splitting story, for all its faults, one can't help but appreciate some of the hilarious scenes throughout the film. Sandler stars as the titular character, a short-tempered and hockey player whose reckless behaviour lands him in many sticky spots, most notably not getting picked for his team for the next season. His stubbornness to play a game he isn't very good at, apart from a killer snapshot, puts him in the crosshair **** called Chubbs, who witnesses Happy and shot and sees a gleaming opportunity to stick him on a golf course, Happy sees the materialistic side of things after his grandmother has failed to pay her taxes and is placed in a nursing home, I suppose thats where the heart of the movie stems from. This sets up what can only be described as ridiculous but also memorable scenes in comedy history. Happy of course receives a cold reception but immediately makes an impression, not to the amusement of the board. He curses, dresses casually and chats up girls cheering him on, and he also punches Bob Barker. With the shallow film though, there obviously comes the predictable nature of how things are going to play out, making for some rather senseless plot points and even characters. Happy himself is also quite a character who is difficult to relate to, his actions are often questionable and I can't help wonder, 'what was the point?"" There is also a heavy basis of product placement, which sort of comes with Sandler territory nowadays, but when an actual ad, passed over as part of the film, actually appears in the running time, its enraging to say the least. With all the flaws, Happy Gilmore certainly won't stick out to reasonable movie lovers, but it should maybe be known as a guilty pleasure for its hilarity in many moments, quite a talented cast including Ben Stiller running an OAP sweatshop and an array of famous faces does make quite a funny and long lasting film.","AUG 9, 2013",6.0,sport

Just Wright,"After going an NBA league-worst 12-70(38 games behind the Atlantic Division-winning Boston Celtics), the New Jersey Nets surely could go for the services of a perennial all-star talent such as Scott McKnight(to be fair, Devin Harris is a decent floor general), since the woeful franchise often played as if Pisces' astrologist Mona Mondieu(Stockard Channing from Gilbert Moses' ""The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh"") and Cadwaller University head coach David Greene(Gabe Kaplan from Jack Smight's ""Fast Break"") were guiding this hapless bunch from the bench. In ""Just Wright"", the Nets lose McKnight to injury during the regular season, but they still make the playoffs, and are one game away from winning the Eastern Conference, when the supposedly indispensable baller makes his triumphant comeback. To a seasoned sports fan, this plot point comes off as a bit anti-climactic, since the Nets were apparently managing just fine without their top player. It's a scenario that recalls Jameer Nelson's return to the Orlando Magic in Game 4 of last year's NBA Finals against the Los Angeles Lakers(boo! hiss!), in which the Amway-owned team learned to live without the St. Joseph's standout. Unlike McKnight, who holds his own against the Miami Heat's Dwayne Wade, Nelson was a step slow, obviously not in game shape, and couldn't keep up with the much older Derek Fisher(more boos! more hisses!). Orlando lost the game, and the game after that, as Los Angeles took the series four games-to-one. ""Just Wright"" is more interesting as a love story than a sports movie, so the big game feels more obligatory than usual, as does the big emotional payoff. Leslie(Queen Latifah) will go on loving Scott(Common), even when his career is over, unlike Morgan(Paula Patton), who drops the star athlete when he suffers that potentially career-ending injury. It's hard to believe that Scott would go back to Morgan after she had bailed on him, and even worse, Leslie takes him back after he realizes his horrible mistake. ""Just Wright"" truly loses its credibility when Morgan's character is redeemed, as if out of guilt for vilifying the gold-digger, since the film shares her proclivity to exalt fame and fortune at all costs. Doesn't the filmmaker realize how much more touching the movie would be if everybody didn't get exactly what they wanted?","AUG 14, 2010",4.0,sport

The Boxer,"A Love Punch. The Boxer Sheridan's sport drama isn't sporty at all. There is definitely hard work in here, but all the guns are aimed towards the aspiration of creating a big wallop of emotional drama that swoops in every political satire in this romantic tale. Now, as you can see, this is a culmination of multiple genre and unfortunately only romance soars above all. The reason being, an amazing lead cast, if Daniel Day Lewis is amiable to the tears of Emily Watson, then so is she to his gut wrenching punches. Combining it, they make one good cinematic couple facing and running away from their past. Fortunately, to cover in all the grounds, the film doesn't just focus on their perspective, the supporting characters too consume the screen time for the justification of their deeds. Take Brian Cox for instance, his character that never helms charge in the film up till the last act, may seem like your average set up of a pawn-like stereotypical antagonist with money and power in his hand. Another surprising package that keeps giving us is Emily's nuanced performance that gets in on the ring through practical insertions like a fearful mother and a wife and more importantly an adolescent lover that as a past haunts her. And in the end, it is all for the man himself, Daniel who is there in the ring himself, struggling and resisting his love towards Emily and a dodgy familiar arena that he adores and calls ""home"". Jim Sheridan, the co-writer and director, is often milking stuff, among this two hour of journey, there is somewhere a good one hour film that needed a better coaching. The Boxer is a hot headed fellow, easily swooned in and boiled up, unfortunately the makers couldn't manipulate it better to make it survive the 12th round.","APR 1, 2019",6.0,sport

Ford v Ferrari,"I can count on 1 finger how many racing car movies I have seen and though I may recall who was in them I don't remember any of them and, sadly, because I had heard good things about ""Ford v Ferrari"" it will probably be in the same category. Based on a true story, the screen writers Jez Butterworth, John-Henry Butterworth and Jason Keller, juggle 4-5 different stories to add human drama to the film while eliminating any one of them would have brought the movie in at a reasonable showing time, way less than the 2 hours and 30 minutes it runs. At the same time the director James Mangold has one too many race scenes, one too many shots of a foot hitting the brakes, more shots than necessary to prove Ken Myles is eccentric or business owners and their employees can be underhanded and ruthless. Caitriona Balfe, though a bit difficult to understand, impressed me playing the wife of Christian Bale, who as driver Ken Myles, has been getting raves for his role, left me cold and also hard to understand. Matt Damon is, as always, impressive in a strong, somewhat silent way, as former champion driver and now designer of race cars. Tracy Letts in the role of Henry Ford II has a 2 minute moving and at the same time funny scene while being solid in the rest of the film. Josh Lucas as the boss's right hand man is an effective villain even if the role is a bit overwritten and obvious. The banter between Damon and Bale tells a lot about both men but one segment, meant to be funny is only funny due to the reaction of Balfe while Bale's scenes with Noah Jupe, just right as his son, shows the man to be a good father. The behind the scenes of business life certainly isn't new but the behind the scenes of the racing sport and business aspect of it and car companies is interesting.

Cars 2,"Cars wasn't Pixar's finest hour but it had style, it was still clever, with some fantastically funny moments. It also had a novelty factor working in its favour. Cars 2 doesn't have that to fall back on and because it lacks the heart of the first its just a shell of a movie. Cars 2 represents an amalgam of recycled jokes, ideas and images from every other film that came before it and because of that you feel empty after having seen it, as if you went to a nice restaurant expecting a big piece of meat but instead you got a salad. Cars 2 moves away from the original in favour of turning the franchise into a comedy spy thriller, because that always works out so well (Get Smart, Johnny English 1 & 2). The introduction of Michael Caine's Finn McMissile does add an element of humour and entertainment but the fact that the film concentrates more on Mater (Larry the Cable Guy) than Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) seemed like a good idea but it eventually grates. Overall by moving away from Cars in favour of making the 2nd film more lively it has taken away some of the things that really did make Cars enjoyable.","OCT 15, 2011",3.0,sport

Driven,"My God. This film is awful. Stallone was an awkward presence in Formula 1 circles during the late 90's when he was seriously considering making a movie about the world's most exotic sport. Thankfully it was eventually deemed too expensive, and instead he turned his attention to the world of CART - America's own cut-price version of Formula 1. Stallone plays a washed-up ex-race driver, which is hilarious in itself. Anyway, the plot is neither here nor there, it's just plain bad. But what is truly awful about this film, and also a slap in the face to all race fans, are the action sequences. Both CART and Indylight cars are used to film the racing scenes, and as any race fan could tell you, the difference between the two is like chalk and cheese. Imagine filming a single-prop Cessna as stand in for 747 Jumbo. Or having Kevin James play Superman to Cavill's Clark Kent. It's that bad.","MAY 15, 2014",1.0,sport
Free Solo,"Alex Honnold is one of the least charismatic subjects I've ever seen central to a documentary. He scoffs at the notion of happiness and how it's not valuable because ""happiness is available to everyone."" Perhaps on the autism spectrum, he is mostly devoid of emotion and, by extension, perspective. His girlfriend tries desperately to coax any care, love or simple reaction from him. The relationship began after she saw him at a book signing so she didn't really know who he was. If he wasn't driven and successful, it would be fun to clock her exit speed out the door. Honnold actually wanted to break up with her at one point because she made a climbing mistake that led to an injury of his. This pathetic relationship, devoid of warmth from his end, totally envelopes the documentary. It's very difficult to watch as his girlfriend pretends that they could be normal one day. The cliffs themselves serve merely as a possible solution to Alex's detachment from understanding himself and the vibrant world around him. It's obvious that the filmmakers would have much rather portrayed Alex as an insightful thrill-seeker with a philosophical, spiritual mind and playful nature. The inspiration they/we were all hoping for and expecting. They are forced to show him for what he is: a ghost whom risks his life in search of his own humanity. That said, the feat itself, taking about ten minutes to show, was impressive. At the summit of El Capitan he is irritated that the phone call with his girlfriend is taking so long as she congratulates him.","APR 1, 2019",3.0,sport
Any Given Sunday,"A poorly written, terribly executed, overly long, and over the top melodrama, Any Given Sunday is a football film that was lukewarm at the time of it's release, and one that has rotted horribly. This movie is over-confident in how good it is, and it makes many mistakes. For one, the same shots are reused and super imposed over each other time and time again, and this comes off as lazy rather than as meaningful repetition. Second, numerous title drops come off as over indulgent rather than organic. Third, this movie compares itself to Ben-Hur, and even portraying football as war does not even put this movie in the same ballpark as Ben-Hur. Fourth, the acting is all over the place, with some decent performances sprinkled in, but most scenes are so over the top and unbelievable that I found myself thinking this was a comedy. There are many better football films out there than Any Given Sunday. I highly encourage you to watch those instead. The only reason this film gets a 2 instead of a 0 is because there are some good performances (Al Pacino's speech at the climax, for instance) and the ensemble cast does mesh well on the rare occasion they are allowed to interact with each other instead of worshipping football as some holy transcendent ideal without ever making the argument for it.","MAR 1, 2019",2.0,sport

Space Jam: A New Legacy,"A ironically hilarious film but an absolutely terrible film none the less. Everything about this film doesn’t work. The story, the acting, the CGI, the references, the script. All of it feels terrible compared to the first film. The first film isn’t that great either but at least it was self aware. This isn’t. The film doesn’t understand when it is making fun of itself and it shows. I enjoyed the references in the first film as they felt natural but this was Ready Player One on steroids and if you don’t like Ready Player One like me, then this will be a nightmare. Sometimes there are cool Easter eggs in the background but some of it feels weird. I love A Clockwork Orange but it still feels weird to see a bunch of characters from that movie watching a Basketball Game. The humor is unintentionally funny. I never laughed at a joke they were trying to make but I laughed at almost everything else because it was so bad that it’s funny. I enjoyed watching this movie but that was probably because I was with friends. I feel like watching this on your own is a painful experience. I did find myself being painfully bored during points but the jokes my friends were making and their reactions helped keep my interest. All of the performances are AWFUL. Lebron James did an awful job. Michael Jordan wasn’t great in the first film either but his performance felt intentionally funny but this was just painful to watch. Don Cheadle was really weird as well. The only reason I kind of enjoyed his performance was because I was joking about him the whole time. The script is the most predictable boring story ever. The first film’s script was predictable as well but the journey to get there was fun and this wasn’t fun. The visual effects look kind of decent at times except Live Action Lola Bunny. Her eyes look really really weird for some reason. I would really only recommend this if you watch it with friends.

Rocky III,"Rocky was a great film, Rocky II was by miles better than the original.... In 1982 we saw the return of Sylvester Stallone as he returns as Rocky Balboa in ""ROCKY III"" and this time Mr.T is his opponent to try and defeat. Rocky (Stallone) gets KO'd and destroyed by Clubber Lang (Mr.T) then Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) says when he beat him it hurt his pride and it hurt him and tells Rocky he needs to get the Eye of the tiger back to defeat Clubber Lang. So Apollo trains him but there's a catch, Burt Young who plays Paulie keeps moaning and being annoying but after training Rocky Balboa (Stallone) must face Clubber Lang once more after strong words about not giving up and if he loses at least he loses with no fear and honour which is roughly what is said by Talia Shire.. Micky Goldmill (Rocky's usual trainer) dies after the first fight with Clubber Lang and Rocky Balboa. This for me is a weak edition into the Rocky series because some of it's good but also laughable and some of it is boring. Thunderlips played by Hulk Hogan does Rocky III no favours either as his character was stupid, unnecessary, laughable, annoying and pathetic.","MAR 20, 2020",1.0,sport

Rocky II,"The first ""Rocky"" is not an extraordinary film, but at least it brought something new. I feel like this one abuses the legacy of the old one, and falls into that habit of trying to enhance what has already worked. Needless to say, it went wrong. Very wrong. The first film also makes an effort to develop its character, but here, as I said above, everything seems to be enhanced. Instead of having a slow character, we have a dumb character. Could he take a beating before? So, let's make him win a fight just by punching him in the face, with the base down, for 90% of the fight. Is he suffering from post-fight pressure? Let's have some guys talk shit to him. Like, it's all so obvious that he loses any sense. You can't get emotional, identify yourself, or even cheer, because if I had doubts before, now I'm sure that Rocky is a terrible fighter. And what's more, the film takes advantage of its past success, reviving scenes and songs from the previous film. Which seems cool at first glance, but aspires to a lack of creativity and laziness. Another thing poorly done was the time transition, where in one scene they are pregnant, and a few moments later they are already in labor. Ultimately, this is what gives the protagonist the opportunity to direct and script the film itself. This is illogical and blinds anyone. Audio: English, with Portuguese subtitles.

Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk,"A rare failure by beloved Taiwanese-American director Ang Lee, Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk is also one of the year's strangest films in regard to craft and release. The story and theme are simple, though: the title character (Joe Alwyn) is a suburban Texan who enlists in the U.S. Army as a teenager and serves in Iraq. After an image of him tending to a severely wounded superior (Vin Diesel) becomes popular online, he is sent on a promotional tour to wave the flag and pacify an anxious public. The tour culminates in he and his surviving squad members' ornamental participation in a Destiny's Child halftime show at a Dallas football game. The majority of the action unfolds within the stadium. Similar to Clint Eastwood's Flags of Our Fathers, a chief aim here is to compare and contrast a soldier's hard-fought understanding of bravery and sacrifice with the easily digestible embellishments and myths presented to the public. Alas, Lee's satire is devoid of venom, and any potential dramatic resonance is undercut by overwrought, at times absurdly platitudinous dialogue; a claustrophobic framing device; and a host of out-of-sync actors, none of whom truly inhabit their characters. As Lynn, British newcomer Alwyn does not exhibit much of interest beyond photogenic blue eyes, registering as vacant rather than tortured, and poor Steve Martin delivers perhaps a career-worst performance as the stadium's unctuous neoconservative owner. These notable shortcomings in regard to acting, pacing, and tone are compounded tenfold by Lee's dramatic decision to film every scene in purportedly hyper-detailed, game-changing 120-frames-per-second 3-D. (Footage so vivid, the viewer can count the pores on Martin's face.) It is hard for a director to change the game, though, when his skeptical distributor outfits only four or five cinemas to project the film as he intended. I saw the final product in standard 2-D, as will ninety-nine-point-nine percent of others. Left-field creative choices presumably intended to enhance the sense of three-dimensional immersion, most notably nauseating closeups of actors delivering their dialogue directly to the camera, no longer have context and are distracting at best, ugly at worst. This minor and spasmodic melodrama, reminiscent of the uneven first wave of war-on-terror parables and treatises (Home of the Brave, In the Valley of Elah, Rendition), certainly does not benefit from this half-realized and inappropriate technical flamboyance.","NOV 18, 2016",2.0,sport

About all the viewer learns is that Jack(Affleck)finished high school, got married, had a son who dies from Leukemia, separated from his wife, became a high rise construction worker and a drunk (not a good combination). If he was a decent guy who just couldn't handle the problems life has thrown at him, I could show a little sympathy, but this guy is a foul-mouthed jerk. Even when he's asked to return to his high school to coach the basketball team because the coach has suffered a heart attack, he refuses to ease off of his drinking and continues to use the foulest language imaginable out on the court, in front of the crowd and the teams of impressionable high school kids. The assistant coaches quietly tell him that there is a code of conduct for teachers and students and he says he'll try to tone it down, but he never does. Please remember; this is a movie about a Catholic high school basketball team. They pray to God, through Jesus Christ before every game. I don't care for Ben Affleck's political views, and that's alright. I can put those aside for the Hollywood crowd. What I can't put aside is a movie that depicts Christianity as a joke.

I openly hated the first Cars film, but convinced myself this was Pixar's way of apologizing and making up for it. Going into the film with incredibly low expectations (for both my memory of the first and poor reviews critically) the film was still worse than I would had anticipated. The characters are one-note, we never see anything endearing about these characters or really get to know them on a personal level. They do not have the instant lovable quality of any other characters which is not just because they are cars, Wall-E made robots look cute and cuddly after all. For a studio as progressive as Pixar I found the portrayals of characters in the film to be stereotypical and unfair and bad representations of the countries in this film (as the plot takes place and features characters from around the globe.) Mater is the single worst character in Pixar's history and it is a slap in the face that they made him an even larger part in the sequel, which is no doubt the worst film in Pixar's history, it should have been scrapped or made straight to dvd.

Rocky V,"The weakest movie in the Rocky franchise. It is more of a misstep. For example: Can you summarize the story of the movie so others would be hyped or interested to see this movie? Yes without a doubt. This is an indicator as everything in this movie can work if done correctly or with a different approach. Lets start with the story: Rocky is back at the USA after the events of Rocky 4. His health has however suffered terribly. Because he was fooled by an accountant he lost all his wealth and is back were he began as his health prevents him from boxing. He decides to become a trainer like Mickey and meets a young aspiring boxer named Tommy Gunn starting to train him. There are also side stories about his family but I stop here as more would ruin the story (Yes, many will claimed it is already ruined by default). From this alone it looks like an awesome movie. It fails in delivering the impact, emotions and characters. It is like doing stuff on a to do list without (enough) care or knowing how it works. Even Sylvester Stallone did not like the movie. It was nominated for 7 or 8 golden raspberries if I remember correctly. The characters again are diluted or weakened by the script. For example there are great scenes that show the potential but then there are others that feel like poorly scripted attempts to get it over. I think I am moving in circles so lets get to my final rating. Overall this is a misstep that had great potential but failed to deliver. Not near the worst movies of all times but also not recommendable. May be compared to Star Trek 5 as it is also the worst in the series but had also great potential. Bonus knowledge: The mentioned Rocky Marciano (Rocco Francis Marchegiano) is a boxer you defiantly should know. He is the only heavyweight champion that finished his career undefeated (49-0). He was not only an excellent boxer but also spent his money the smart way and stopped a potential comeback when he realized he was not as good as before. Remark: Rocky is not inspired from him. Chuck Wepner inspired Sylvester Stallone for Rocky.","OCT 18, 2020",3.0,sport

They have just replaced the word Racing Plane for Fire Fighter, the animation has somehow managed to get worse and the fact that this was left in cinemas for as long as it was, meant that more parents took kids to see this than decent children's movies that came out this year (seriously Despicable Me 2 and the Croods were much better than this). kids deserve a better class of movie than this. The cars films were dreadful, Planes was even worse.

Kickboxer,"Oh lord it's bad. However let's begin with the positive. Atmosphere is cool and accurate, landscapes are great, there are two or three angles and scenes that remain inspired. Van Damme gives the best he can and it is hard to blame him for that. Scenario is simple. Now tackle what's bad and I warmly reccomand you to hang on. Scenario is way too simple and predictable. We saw this schema over and over: the guy who don't know anything getting trained the old way to defeat a new school hardcore rookie making his own rules and laws. The training part is a huge sequence of stereotypes and uninspired exercises. Absolutely unoriginal. The movie was literally unable to make me worry about the characters. According to the logic of american movies, when you can't control a mad guy you are supposed to shoot him but when the bad guys are able to do so they don't. The plot then loses all its importance, eveything seems shallow and missed. Bad guys were in a good way when they captured Van Damme's relatives but the scenario just flips once again to let the hero win easily. The fact that this movie ends on Van Damme's victory is a huge sign that it has nothing more to do than to show us the final fight. World does not stop after a single win, wake up. Your brother Eric is far from being healed. Overall acting is really ineffective. I know Van Damme has a lot to do with this fact but the rest of the cast doesn't help. The only decent ones were V. Anderson (playing as Winston Taylor) and sometimes Alexio (Eric the brother). Jokes are not jokes because not even close to funny. This movie is all about exposing Van Damme's impressive body and flexibility. Romance is digusting. When there is only one significative woman in the hole movie she obviously has to be for the hero. Other women are a **** for Eric and the nurse getting her ass touched by Eric. Did I mention the plot used the heroin's **** to move forward? Was it even useful? Don't think so. But thank you so much for these disgusting and appalling stereotypes and behaviors, Mr. DiSalle, now go get some basic respect lessons.

RUSSIAN names for bandits look questionable, I understand that this is the case, BUT NOT IN A CHILDREN'S CARTOON. As a result, the film set itself a high bar, which, unfortunately, it could not achieve. Perhaps I'm taking Cars 2 too seriously, but that's because I think it's for both kids and adults.

Seven Days in Utopia,"Seven Days in Utopia is the sweet story of promising young Texas golfer Luke Chisholm (Lucas Black) who chafes under the control of his mentor father. In his first golf match on the pro tour, his father (Joseph Lyle Taylor) abandons him publicly, and Luke melts down and leaves the match, driving until he reaches Utopia, Texas. There he meets retired golf pro Johnny Crawford (Robert Duvall) who helps him get back his game over the next seven days while he romances local girl Sarah (Deborah Ann Woll) and endears himself to the town folk (Kathy Baker, Melissa Leo). After his lessons in Utopia, complete with Bible instruction, Luke then returns to his now remorseful and conciliatory father for another chance at the tour. Because the venerable Robert Duvall, Melissa Leo and Kathy Baker signed on for this production, I ventured out to see Seven Days in Utopia. Despite its seasoned cast, this film comes off as well-intentioned but amateurish. With the exception of Duvall and Leo, the performances were shallow stereotypes of rural Texas people made worse by some silly costuming. The filmmakers clearly believe rural Texans are completely lacking in sophistication and never watch TV, shop at a department store or visit a hair dresser. The final absurdity comes when the local boy played by Brian Geraghty takes off his straw hat and gives it to Luke as a farewell gesture of friendship--everyone knows that any Texas cowboy worth his salt would never part with his hat--just ask Lyle Lovett. The film also has a gimmicky ending which left me feeling as if I had been watching an infomercial for the past 90 minutes. In short, this is a sweet fairy tale that portrays life and Texas as the filmmakers imagine it, and not as it is. The lack of authenticity in the setting and characters leave the plot ungrounded and the film difficult to regard as serious cinema. Sometimes this happens when filmmakers are more intent on making a statement rather than telling a good story, or they are just inexperienced. Either way, I can only give Seven Days in Utopia a three. 'Nuff said, ya'll. This review also appeared at ****.","OCT 25, 2011",3.0,sport

Space Jam: A New Legacy,"Pros: - the film has a good mood, it manages to make us laugh. - Visually it is very beautiful. Cons: - Mixed up the present time of electronic games with basketball. - They made fun of Michael Jordan, instead of the WB being more endearing and trying to convince him to have a cameo in the film. - WB bragging about what they have (that's why the film was approved), they put in a lot of unnecessary stuff they have. Server Verse, because it's fashionable to put a multiverse and there's no creativity for new things. - I consider this film to be anything but Space Jam. They used the name only as bait to catch people. Worst: Very hypocritical movie. Send the message to be ourselves, but change the look of the less sexualized Lola Bunny. Sexualized.... A current world where sexualization is exposed everywhere: fluid gender, non-binary, ****, women showing off on the internet naked, girls cosplaying in tiny clothes to gain a following on social media, women showing off intimate parts on Tik Tok to earn likes and money... But the look of a 1996 cartoon is not good. 1996 was better than 2021. Do you know why? The minority had access to the internet. Today, with globalization, everyone can communicate: those who think and those who have the brains to decorate. They sealed Pepe le Pew accusing it of being a harassment cartoon, instead of the fabulous geniuses of the WB board putting Pepe le Pew just romantic but without grabbing Penelope. They almost sealed the Ligeirinho, accused of racism and prejudice against the Mexicans. But building a wall to separate the United States from Mexico and killing anyone trying to cross the border is very ethical. Society is preventing society itself from living.

Waves,"Trey Edward Shults, director and screenwriter of ""Waves"", along with his cameraman Drew Daniels, has never met a color or a scene he doesn't love repeating more than once. If someone uses the 'f' word let's have a few people say it at least 20 times just as filming inside a car with a 360 degree turn of the camera is effective, and looks good, let's film it 3 different times. Oh and let's use every color of the rainbow flashing in all sorts of shapes over and over and over plus 2 more times. Should a scene have a guy throwing up let's do it again with the same guy and then another with a different guy. The film is cut into 2 parts with the first concentrating on Tyler, played by Kelvin Harrison, Jr., and the second on Emily, played by Taylor Russell, his younger sister. We meet their parents Ronald, played by Sterling K. Brown and Catherine, played by Renee Elise Goldsberry, who married Ronald and brought up the two kids as their mother had died when they were quite young. The first half is filled with violence and is basically a cliche all around. The script holds no surprises except, maybe, for whirling , flashing and never stop moving camera shot. The second is sweeter, quieter as Emily meets and gets to know Luke, played by Lucas Hedges, sharing a young love as only teenagers can. There is a completely unnecessary scene, and person, involving the two plus a third character who when you hear about them you know a hospital scene is ahead. It could have been cut and having a movie run 2 hours instead of 2 hours and 15 minutes! The acting by all, including Alexa Demie playing Alexis, Tyler's girlfriend, is above board handling scenes you have seen in many pictures before as if it was the first time it was shown on screen but, sadly, the screenwriter offers nothing new and only approaches each segment with flashing, fading, glowing bright lights. The best part of ""Waves"", and Shults does repeat it a few times, is hearing Dinah Washington singing her classic version of ""What A Difference A Day Makes""!","DEC 5, 2019",2.0,sport

The location wasn't great either, although the monastery was still more interesting than Okinawa in my opinion, but still not much. I just don't get it.

Any Given Sunday,"the mediocrity of the genre.. Any Given Sunday Any Given Sunday is a character driven sport drama about the inner world and politics that brews in behind the football games. With unnecessary slow motions, edgy and benign camera work and amateur editing the feature shucks aways its own integrity before it build up a definite mannerism. The semantics of the tale is off putting as it either is raw dry news or over thought out shallow emotional drama. There is not a single piece of loose thread among these many characters and their plot tracks that urges the viewers to root for more or even accept the offered banal ideology. The conversations are pragmatic with some intriguing even though textbook and one dimensional characters, that is tossed decently by the performers in here. The annoyingly loud argumentative conversations, scattered structure and cheesy one liners are the primary anchors why it sinks so bad. The background score is loud, the set pieces are bling, the cinematography is daft and editing is more questionable than feasible. Pacino's portrayal is moving and effective but as the characteristics and substance offered to the character is irritatingly loud henceforth fails to create the anticipated impact. The supporting characters are just chess pieces that seem to have misplaced and existed only to sacrifice to drive the track to the pit and with a water thin material as such Diaz, Foxx and Quaid fails to deliver. Stone's attempt to offer the football fans the time of their life, unfortunately wasn't planned or polished to even be what it was in the script; swing and a miss. Conversations between Pacino and Foxx and Pacino's monologues and ideology are the only high points of the feature. Any Given Sunday is not a disappointment because it ain't well crafted, it is misconceived because it fails to even live up to the mediocrity of the genre.","SEP 16, 2018",3.0,sport

The first movie ended at a good note and didn't need any following, plus the story they went with is unnecessary. I don't know about most people, but I didn't need to see a movie where the characters travel to a World Grand Prix, which is pretty much a story line that could have been used as an epilogue for the first movie. The spy story line was fun for the first scene but quickly transformed into a pointless story line for the only purpose of giving Mater more screen time and creating situations that he can act ""wacky"" in. The movie also attempts to cover up the fact that it was made for money by making some half-assed message about friendship. However, the animation is great, which is no surprise for Pixar, so the whole movie is far from being ugly like some other animated movies (Gnomeo and Juliet for example).

This film is definitely one sided in favor of steroids and the way it's presented leaves you feeling like the primary goal for the film maker was to justify his brothers' use of steroids. I even suspected near the end that the film maker was still on the needle. Interviews are typically in favor of steroid use and even a majority of the people being interviewed are on steroids.

The movie gave the impression that throughout the race Maiden was contending for the lead. All the other boats were treated like chopped liver.

Ford v Ferrari,"What a shame to have wasted a great story and a great adventure for Ford and Shelby...! because this rubbish of a film does not pay homage to them, it ridicules and caricatures them without their consent! this overly long film only delivers two and a half hours of pro-American propaganda, stupid dialogues, chest puffing and little marshmallows. This shitty film makes Enzo seem like a (very) badly behaved mafioso and Henry Ford (second of the name) for a reactionary who cries like a baby (never seen anything so distressing). In any case, we learn nothing but nothing at all about the development of the car, the height of it...! In terms of realism, it's a more or less walking catastrophe, wandering like an alcoholic mammoth in a race of porcelain cars... or rather entirely in computer-generated images! it's obviously the easy solution but also the trap of big nonsense into which they fell with both feet... don't look for the slightest realism in this, we're in Hollywood... That said, James Mangold's film has at least one quality: it is its very good production, outside or on the track, even if it explodes like in a Star Wars, it is still very clear and rather pleasant to follow when we don't get bored or curse at all its faults at every turn. Obviously, taking Matt Damon to play Shelby (?!) had to be daring... and there's no miracle, Damon remains universally, irremediably bad, pathetically bad; we would then like to fall back on Christian Bale but the latter, strangely contaminated by Damon, only acts and overplays: he turns out to be as unbearable as the other guy! it's new for Bale, I've honestly never seen that... In the end, we end up with a bogus film that sounds sadly hollow...

Cars 2,"Pixar, known for its stunning animation, takes a detour into the world of espionage and international intrigue. But the shiny surfaces and vibrant landscapes from the first film are replaced with a globetrotting mishmash of locations that feels more like a checklist than a coherent narrative. It's like they raided the prop department of a James Bond film and threw everything into the blender without a second thought. Soundtrack: Now, the soundtrack. If you were expecting the nostalgic charm of the first film's classic rock and country tunes, think again. ""Cars 2"" trades that in for a forgettable, generic action movie score. It's like they hired a B-list composer who was on autopilot. The music is so bland that it makes you appreciate just how integral a good soundtrack is to the Pixar formula. Story and Characters: Buckle up for the plot, or should I say, the lack thereof. Lightning McQueen, voiced once again by Owen Wilson, is relegated to a secondary character in his own sequel. Instead, we get Mater, the tow truck, thrust into a spy caper that's more convoluted than rush-hour traffic. The charm and simplicity of the first film are abandoned for a storyline that's as forced as an awkward family road trip. Themes: Now, let's talk themes. ""Cars 2"" attempts to rev its engine with a message about alternative fuel sources, but it's about as subtle as a sledgehammer. The environmental message feels shoehorned in, and instead of sparking thoughtful conversation, it comes off as preachy and out of place in a film that should be more concerned with telling a coherent story. In the grand Pixar canon, ""Cars 2"" is like the black sheep of the family. It's a misguided attempt to cash in on the success of the first film, sacrificing heart and storytelling for a haphazard globetrotting adventure that's more exhausting than exhilarating. It's a film that makes you question why they decided to take this particular franchise in such a baffling direction. It's a disappointing pit stop in the Pixar journey, a film that trades substance for spectacle and leaves you wondering if they should have just let this franchise rest in the garage.","DEC 10, 2023",2.0,sport
Space Jam: A New Legacy,"So I waited to see if this was even worth watching and of course it wasn't. If you can watch it for free I'd tell you not to because they should be paying you to test out this disappointment. This movie had it coming with making Lola less attractive (and attacking people for it great job!) Taking out a character because weak reason that even a child can destroy, changing the already corny plot, making this movie more diverse ( by that they meant putting a ton of black actors and barely anything else that's diversity right?) And finally putting Le James and knowing people don't like the guy was the biggest blow they could've done. Hire anyone besides a person who isn't a actor it's like hiring a lawyer who isn't a lawyer or a plumber who isn't a plumber because it'll go well right? What people forget is the damage they do to the characters and everyone involved.They lost money no way are they using the loony toons again in something. James will get dunked on by everyone for failing to act and making a decent movie. Black actors will look bad and say ""it's because something something racism"" No that doesn't work that way. Just because you bombed doesn't mean it's a race problem just make a freaking good movie. The real problem with this movie is how it does everything wrong and doesn't get a cancel mob on it. Media in general is killing off every single thing that was good and now we get this ""diversity"" woke trash (again hiring 80% or more black cast isn't diversity its the same problem but the other way around) hope you like Anime and Korean webtoons because thank God they know what sells!","AUG 22, 2021",1.0,sport

Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk,"Fashioned as an Awards favorite entering 2016, Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk promised innovative technology in the form of 120fps and 4k, while being helmed by Ang Lee. Coming off of Life of Pi, one had to assume that this film would be Lee's triumphant war film to add to his resume. Unfortunately, it is an absolutely abhorrent film. Perhaps watching it on a television sells it a bit short without the technology, but the 120fps feels like it was nothing more than a band-aid, covering up the gaping and infected wound that is the script. The acting is equally horrible, but the film is akin to the Star Wars prequels. It has a script so bad that no actor could reasonably be expected to save the film and make the dialogue sound natural or anything better than unintentional comedy. Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk is worse than anyone could have ever imagined. Starring Joe Alwyn as Billy Lynn, a man who fended off the ""enemy"" as he defended Sgt. Virgil Breen (Vin Diesel) from being attacked further, the video of the incident goes viral. As a result, Lynn and his fellow troops are shuttled around America on a thank you tour, culminating with an appearance at a not-the-Dallas Cowboys game. Appearing in the halftime show with Destiny's Child, the boys are greeted by definitely-not-Jerry Jones (Steve Martin), his stooges, and the many Americans who thank the troops just to feel better about themselves and meet their patriotism quota. Ang Lee's film explores this hollow patriotism, the horrors of war and what it does to young men in the form of PTSD, and is decidedly anti-war, but pro-soldier. Unfortunately, Lee's script misses the mark. With preachy dialogue that explains every little theme he wishes to explore in the film, Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk is in-your-face and entirely hamfisted. Rather than more nuanced looks at heroism and the need of American society to feel connected to the war through these young men, Lee's script merely preaches at the viewer for nearly two hours. The characters are all incredibly cookie cutter and the scenarios they find themselves in entirely laughable. For example, Wayne Foster (Tim Blake Nelson) - a successful oil industry man involved in fracking - approaches the soldiers to give them thanks and ask how the war is going. Sgt. David Dime (Garret Hedlund) responds by aggressively putting him in his place and preaching Lee's own personal anti-fracking beliefs. In a press conference, Lee has the soldiers being pestered with questions and, before they answer the question, Lynn imagines a fake response in black-and-white that is actually true. Answering a question about the progress of the war, Lynn imagines Dime responding by saying they are doing a great job creating new terrorists. This on-the-nose explanation of what Lee thinks of war is grating and thoroughly unpleasant to experience. For a director capable of great works, it is a shame to see him forget the basic tenant of screenwriting ""show and do not tell"". By ignoring this advice, you wind up with Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk. This is further preached at us through Norm Oglesby (Martin). The soldiers are working with Albert (Chris Tucker) to get a movie made about them, but they only have the length of the game to get a deal done (I have no idea why). After initially telling them that Hilary Swank wanted to play Billy Lynn in the movie - which is an offensive joke that finds comedy by mocking transsexuality, again shocking from Lee who made Brokeback Mountain - the deals all fall through. Only left is Oglesby who offers the soldiers $5,500 a piece plus a percentage of the profits for the deal. He then explains to Billy that their story is America's not their own. Naturally, the script has Billy put him in his place and explain that it is their lives and they actually live these events. In the bathroom immediately after, Albert comes in and exclaims that it was like something out of a movie. Hysterical, annoyingly self-aware, and a further example of Lee pummeling the audience with his own personal beliefs and what he wants us to all get out of this film. As with any awful script, the film is not without horrific dialogue. When not preaching at us, the script still feels inauthentic. It never stops feeling written and it borders on comedy at times. The scenarios they find themselves in - fighting security, fighting an obnoxiously **** guy in the crowd - never feel natural. It all feels so staged and pre-planned. This is a film that never feels real. It consistently feels like it is a movie and goes to great lengths to remind us that it is a film, not just with the interaction in the bathroom with Albert either. While watching the game, Billy shows Albert the cheerleader he made out with earlier, Faison (Makenzie Leigh). Remarking that all great movies have a love story, Lee sets us up for more awful dialogue in the form of this half-baked romance.","FEB 15, 2017",3.0,sport

Inside Out,"Fantastic animation, good initial idea... But I have quite a few beefs with this movie, so here we go: 1. As usual, Disney paints out the ""normal"" person with a broad brush designed to appeal to the largest number of people, instead of giving the main character any sort of uniqueness or depth (which are ""normal"" in Real Life!). In comparison, Studio Ghibli's female characters are all very complex and different. You don't need to get the audience to identify with the character's every trait and thoughts. There is nothing interesting about Riley, she's clearly been constructed as the ""mainstream kid"", almost a blank slate, America's archetypical kid (white middle class, single child). 2. There is some lovely symbolism in the movie, but most of the story-telling that happens inside Riley's head appears completely unrelated to what is happening in Riley's reality. What does it mean that Joy and Sadness are lost in long-term memory? This is the central part of the movie, and it drags on and on, and most of its aspects don't seem to help Riley's character development. 3. Of all the core emotions they could have picked, why disgust? I mean, what about love, selfishness, or empathy? Disgust seems mostly irrelevant to the whole movie, and extending her role from protecting Riley from poisoning to social acceptance (make-up, dress etc.) is such a stretch that it makes no sense to me. 4. At the end of the movie, my 5-year-old son laughed his head off. I asked him what his favourite part was, and he said ""The cat at the end! I want to watch this over and over again!"". Getting into other characters' heads was the comic aspect of the movie, and the little they did (about 5 minutes altogether) was very well done and very, very funny. But keeping it to the trailer and the credits makes it look like the original ideas around the movie were discarded because they interrupted the very serious emotional tone that was supposed to drive it.

Nope, I am stopping this here, Charlie's had problems from start to finish, weak to nonexistent plot, bad writing, no real driving force behind any part of it.

Also, it's some of Michael Cera's worst acting to date. He's still playing the same part he's been playing since Arrested Development. Don't believe the previews! This IS NOT a kung fu/action movie. It's a romantic comedy that makes a few trite references to videogames. As a big fan of Mr. Wright, but not of the source material, I was a bit apprehensive, and I can see why. It just came across as a jumbled mess. Yeah, that's what I want in my movies, 8 million pop culture references but no original humor of it's own.

Step Brothers,"What might one expect from the combination of Will Ferell and John C Reilly? They gave us that inane Nascar race flick, so we should know well just what exactly their product would be. I do like their daring and resourcefulness though - in a time of serious, realistic movies, they dare producing something so inane and ludicruously and purposely-funny and yet, they turn in performances that are just right for their parts. The movie's theme might be a bit too unusual, but both Ferell and Reilly are perfect in their depictions. I do wonder - if a 40-year-old man WERE unemployed and staying home with their parents, would they also be as child-like and immature like these two? Or is it just a comedy no-brains flick that Ferell and Reilly would have us believe?? I would like to hope that there is a social message here somewhere, but of course, if they had acted like grownups, that might have totally ruined it! Robert Jenkins and Mary Steenburgen are good together, but at times, I really cringed at how low Jenkins might stoop to - his character is empty and has absolutely no substance. I do feel for Steenburgen, her empathy for her two sons, her moving-on-with-what-my-life-really-is countenance is impressive. But obviously, if the perfect ending hadn't happened, if Jenkins and Steenburgen's characters hadn't got back together again, and the elder brother, Derek, hadn't piped down, it wouldn't have been a comedy flick, would it? Seriously, Ferell's testicle-scene was the last straw - it was totally unnecessary and absolutely disgusting. But then again, what reason and logic do we expect from Ferell anymore? I'd go with his Megamind depiction anyday than this disgust of a movie! This doesn't mean that he's not funny, he is, but at times, he can just be too uncontrollable and too inane.

Funny? Yes! Charming, oh yes! Too long? Indeed! Despite mixing an outdated psychology of emotions with contemporary concepts of mind, the biggest fault of Inside Out is overestimating its story as worth a full-length feature film. Half of the film is a round-around journey of the two main characters trying to return (without success) to their headquarters.

Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,"Are you kidding me? This movie is a commentary on what most individuals see the young generation in the United States as; whiny, hopped up on video games, and way too involved with themselves. Wright decides to alienate movie goers not familiar with the graphic novel by bombarding the screen with bright lights and colors, while forgetting to develop characters and story into something the average movie goer can connect with. Unless you left your house playing video games to go see this movie, and then immediately after the movie went back to your Zelda game to see if you could complete it before your Mom came downstairs to tell you it was bedtime, even though you are in your 30's, this movie is not for you. The one redeeming quality was the soundtrack was pretty enjoyable. The Sex Bom-Ombs were a quirky ode to punk and alternative rock, while the theme of underground ""independent"" music played a nice backdrop of normality and reality to Scott's world of self absorbed nerds and cliches.

Runaway Bride,"Even when they slow dance after being with the audience for a while, I didn't see any spark. Runaway Bride The director Gary Marshall, I think, didn't see this coming. And I know no one presumes the film to perform bad. But there is a certain level of expectations, a ballpark figure, a certain range that it would cover. This is a total disaster. And to be honest I can see what could be the birth of this idiosyncratic idea that it plants so proudly in this farm. But as I have always said an idea isn't everything. At least we can agree in this show business by now is that no idea is stupid. The depiction of a smart idea done poorly comes off stupid. And no matter how stupid an idea, if executed carefully, we have seen such films turn classic instantly, take MASH for example- the Donald Sutherland one. But if a stupid idea is project stupidly, it's a stupid film, in capitals; just as stupid as using this word these many times. Still I'd like to defend the film. And you can only do it with Julia Roberts, its finest asset colored totally lazy in the film. The film's actual odd and even contradicting nature comes because of her character and still there is a lot to explore there. That is of course, not to say that the storyline in any manner justifies the decisions of the film. But for a brief period, her character shows us something profoundly mirroring to what our society whips us with religiously. And when that note, which is either rushed on questionably or the makers were not aware of the magnitude of its brilliance, hits the screen there is a comforting realization and surprise in our face that a film of this genre usually does not offer us. Runaway Bride is still a forgettable date movie, I mean I can't even promisingly say that there is some chemistry.","SEP 11, 2019",2.0,comedy

Let me give you an example of what this terrible film does. So Scott is hanging out with his bros and his lesbian girlfriend or whatever and his psycho high school girlfriend pops in up in the window. The Zelda item theme plays. This is supposed to be a bad thing, why is that jingle playing now? It makes absolutely no sense and was clearly only thrown in because hipsters love Zelda, even though they don't play the games. A better video game movie? Probably Wreck it Ralph. Or maybe even the Super Mario Brothers movie. Even that film had Bob-ombs who did what they supposed to do.

I particularly loathe this endless portrayal of men as weak, disempowered, needy and hopeless as were both the Caucasian AND the Latino love interests – the Brazilian was only faking masculine empowerment. He possessed none. “Woman On Top” implies that Cruz is usurping the masculine role and therefore the power associated with it, but does she really need weak men around her to emphasize this? Perhaps to create a made-for-TV storyline.

Guess Who,"'Guess Who' is a dry comedy, a remake of the classic 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' (1967), only this time, it has a race role reversal, where the original film was about a white family meeting a black man, this film centers around a black family meeting a white man. This new concept had the potential to be very funny and ironic, but instead, is just pondering and badly timed. The movie stars Ashton Kutcher as Simon Green, who is the boyfriend of Theresa Jones (Zoe Saldana), and she wants him to meet her family. She brings him to dinner and it seems that Simon is having trouble getting on with her father, Percy (Bernie Mac). The movie focuses heavily on the working relationship between these two opposite characters. It also seems that the relationship between Simon and Theresa is put further to the test since it seems that Simon may have lied about what he does. Theresa sees that there could be no way to fix this relationship if they can't trust each other enough. Percy seems to enjoy seeing Simon suffer for a while when his relationship with Theresa doesn't seem to be working out. But, sooner or later, Simon and Percy settle their differences to make things right. The film is incredibly unfunny, and some of the best and capable actors don't do much with the material they are given. It is a wasted potential as the reverse premise could have been something more, but instead is just used as a modern gimmick. Ashton Kutcher isn't funny enough, to me, to be the main subject in this film. I never personally thought he is capable enough to carry a movie. There is little care for any of these characters in this movie, they all fall under the usual cliche tropes in any romantic comedies.

Ratatouille,"This film is a visual masterpiece, no question about it, but the tremendous work put into it is completely wasted because of the boring and mindless plot. It's about a rat who reads French cookbooks (I assume he can read in countless other languages too). The ghost of a deceased chef haunts our cute creature. (How did he stumble upon a rat in the first place?) Remy learns a lot from the chef's recipes, and shares his immense knowledge with a nerd with no talent whatsoever, using him as a puppet, and this bizarre double act self-evidently outdo any well trained cook in Paris. Moreover, the food critic whose devastating review made the former chef of the restaurant (our strange ghost) commit suicide, is enchanted with the dish based on the recipe of aforementioned chef, but prepared by our nerd who is guided bye the highly literate rat. This goofy mess of a story could still be partly compensated by a decent amount of jokes, but there is hardly any trace of them. All we left with is the stunning animation.","JUL 21, 2013",1.0,comedy

Inside Out,"I feel like I am the minority here, but I really did not enjoy this film. I have been a Pixar fan for years, even since my dad bought me Toy Story on VHS and me, him and my step-mother watched it in the living room on our projector. They had a good cast (minus Lewis Black. That guy just grates me), just to me it falls apart at it's story line and it's execution. Where it falls apart for me is the characters and the lack of development they have. You just don't feel anything towards them, so you don't care for or feel any of the emotions that they are feeling. This disappointed me as with their previous film ""Up"", and they managed feel every range of emotion possible in the space of the first 10 minutes. The other big problem I had with Inside Out was that the world that populate the feature with-in Riley's ""psyche"" were boring, bland, lifeless and unimaginative. When the 2 main characters are having navigate themselves through them, they just leave nothing memorable. To me, the worlds are literally dead and lifeless. I have 2 positives, though they do not compare the 2 negatives I have already listed. The animation (unsurprisingly) is stunning and is the exact level you expect a Pixar animation to be at. Now to the most enjoyable part of the film in my opinion. The story revolves around the emotions residing inside of Riley's head and essentially revolves around her. The most enjoyable part of the film for me was where we showed the emotions inside the mother and fathers heads, and also during the credits scene you see inside quite a few other characters heads. It is pretty funny as well as very inventive. Shame that it is barely 5 minutes of the entire film. I can see kids enjoying the film, but being a long standing Pixar film fan, I did not enjoy it in the slightest. I hope they do better on their next project.","AUG 11, 2015",3.0,comedy

Crimes and Misdemeanors,"I could never really get into this one. There are a lot of philosophical questions being discussed, largely of the ethical nature, but it just felt really pointless to me. Maybe that was the point, I'm not sure, but regardless, it never really grabbed me. At the end of the day, I just saw two pointless stories being told for some unknown reason and totally lacking in interest. One story was somewhat interesting, the one concerning Martin Landau's character. There was plenty of depth there and it really does save this movie as we see him grappling with the decisions he had made. On the other hand, the story concerning Woody Allen's character is annoying and a waste of time. It felt like they did not feel they had enough with the other story and tacked this on for no reason. Really, all we see is a man who is wrapped up in his hatred of this other guy and let's it get to annoying heights. Luckily, there are occasional moments of comedy that help bolster this one up a bit as well or else the rating would be far lower. I really do not understand the praise for this one.","APR 12, 2014",3.0,comedy

I enjoyed the Time Traveler's Wife, and this was like that except lacking everything that made that movie interesting, with hardly any significant, interesting time travel and a boring, pathetic loser for a main character who never grows at all throughout the movie. The film doesn't make you care at all about ANY of the characters, in fact, because it never really tries to. The only ""tear jerking"" that happens is because of the sappy music and the marriage and baby stuff that some women love to fawn over despite the lack of connection to any of the characters in the film. It drags on especially toward the end for no real apparent reason other than to add to the sap appeal for the characters that we have no connection whatsoever to because, again, none was ever developed. The reviews promised a chick flick that men could actually enjoy. It did not deliver whatsoever. I can't see anyone with taste enjoying this film. Rated 2 because the first 20 minutes were somewhat interesting.

Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,"Just like others before me, I am a gamer. I enjoy manga, comics, reading up on the game industry, etc. Obviously I could be categorized as a person who would enjoyed this film, but this film was horrible. It was not due to the gaming references or the corny one liners littered throughout the movie, but rather, the love story itself that was carelessly woven for Scott and Ramona. It's not the emotionally moving, heart felt, passionate sort of love that would move anyone. In fact, it felt selfish and obnoxious. I really felt bad for Knives who seemed more likeable than Ramona, and better fit for Scott. The other characters were barely worth mentioning aside from Scott's **** room-mate who, at-least, brought some comic relief. Either way, the main character himself, Scott, is flat and uninspiring. And the story only got worse whenever the 7 ex-boyfriends were thrown in for good old mindless showdowns that have absolutely nothing to do with what this movie really is: a romantic comedy. Let me repeat this: This is not an action movie. It's for Twilight-look alike, wannabe gamers that give the rest of us a new reason to be ashamed.

The Mexican,"'The Mexican': Brad and Julia Misfire! So Brad and Julia finally coordinated their schedules so they could be in the same movie! As mere mortals, we can only humbly imagine the awesome alignment of personal managers, agents, casting directors and studio executives (and let's not forget their message-taking, coffee-getting underlings) it must have taken to make this event take place. I mean, people should win Oscars for that stuff, right? But for now, let me take the time to analyze the movie in which these legends have agreed to appear as characters. This terrible movie in which they have agreed to appear, I should add. It's called ""The Mexican"" and features Pitt and Roberts (oh dear, am I listing them in the right order?) as two misfit, offbeat lovers. He's Jerry Welbach, a bagman for a crime syndicate who is trying to get out of the business. She's his girlfriend, Samantha, who's dying to be a Vegas croupier and wants Jerry to quit his dirty work. Unfortunately, Jerry runs a red light, causing an accident, which indirectly sets into motion a whole series of connected events. His boss is sent to jail, leaving the second-in-command, Bernie (Bob Balaban), to give Jerry an ultimatum: complete one more assignment or get killed. Jerry goes with the life plan. He agrees to go to Mexico and retrieve a priceless collector's item, an antique pistol known as ""the Mexican."" This gun has a heartbreaking story behind it, which we learn about over the course of the movie. Samantha is not happy about this extra mission, and she breaks up with Jerry, whom she considers selfish and incompetent at running his life. She splits for Vegas to realize her gaming dream. Both run into complications. In Mexico, a freak accident leaves Jerry bearing the blame for a dead man. This makes his bosses even angrier. En route to Vegas, Samantha runs afoul of two hit men (James Gandolfini and Sherman Augustus), who are battling each other to hold her hostage. The one who calls himself Leroy (Gandolfini) wins the bloody contest and keeps Samantha prisoner until Jerry brings back that gun. Samantha, who's big on the science of romantic relationships, becomes friendly with her captor. And they bond, despite the situation. There's much more to this, but I would tax your patience and mental energy to describe it all. On the Mexican side of the border, the movie rolls out the familiar cliches: sullen Mexicans sipping tequila in bars, cars being hijacked under gringos' noses, extended scenes of desolate landscapes, Spaghetti Western guitar licks here and there. You get the idea. Pitt has some very funny moments, but he's the only attraction in a pretty mediocre sojourn in Mexico. Meanwhile, in the gaming state, it's time for Julia to be Julia, playing cute, crying, smiling, widening her eyes, puffing out that Firestone upper lip and occasionally dipping into that basso profundo voice for comedic effect. It's a familiar routine, which she can do in her sleep; she almost does. She's not nearly as funny or appealing as Gandolfini, the star of ""The Sopranos,"" a truly funny guy. It's his hangdog, deadpan performance that makes her character look better, which makes his look even better. When Samantha asks Leroy if he's going to kill her, he replies: ""Depends on too many variables to answer right now."" Of course, much of the credit for the funny nuggets must go to J.H. Wyman's script, which makes ""The Mexican"" much more tolerable than it deserves to be. But for the most part, the movie – thanks to the uber-presence of Pitt and Roberts – feels patently inauthentic. For one thing, both stars spend most of the movie apart. Perhaps this is where all those agents and personal managers exercised their ""talents,"" by making sure their clients got to strut their stuff individually, while smaller marquee names provided ego-less backup. The result: At no point do Jerry and Samantha seem romantically connected at all.

We give our hard earned money to be entertained, I think that we need to start calling the The Ghost Buster Reboot Phenomenon or (TGBRP) for short. Are we now expected to rate movie on a Cinematic Bell Curve. So will I have to rate the Departed an amazing film from Martin Scorsese the same as Independent film of a Transsexual, Bi-polar, half Nigerian half Burmese midget Muslim atheist walking in circles in a mind field for 90 minutes just as highly as the former. Should we do this because of the adversity that was over come by the film maker in their life. Nope, I am stopping this here, Charlie's had problems from start to finish, weak to nonexistent plot, bad writing, no real driving force behind any part of it. The acting was okay to good at times however this is not an issue of a Blind Watchmaker more of a case of a Un-Edited writer a near sighted Director and an innate ability to blame others for personal inability.

This movie does not succeed in any genre whether it be romantic comedy, drama or action. Scott Tobias has a habit of overrating movies, but he gives a good review with ""So why, given its moment-to-moment surplus of visual imagination, does the film feel so hollow and unsatisfying?"". Also to other amateur reviewers out there who say ""I can definitely see how a critic or viewer would give it a low score, because they just don't get it. It doesn't interest them. It's ok!

Freaks of Nature,"This opened Fri 10/30 without ANY pre-opening reviews or advertising. That either means that Columbia Pictures is hoping to develop a quirky cult classic or they're minimizing their expenses on a known loser. In this case, unquestionably the latter. It's set in a small town where humans, zombies and vampires live together until an alien invasion causes panic. While the concept has potential, the execution is a disaster (and not in a good sense). The action is sloppy, the effects are dull and the characters aren't interesting (despite B-listers like Dennis Leary, Bob Odenkirk & Keegan-Michael Key hamming it up).

Step Brothers,"Finding The Voice Together Step Brothers McKay's daunting task to bring two comic energies on screen that is of such high caliber with an eerie relationship to work on, is an average brawler sparked up by illuminating performances. A gullible world as such of McKay is his core strength, and he makes sure he uses it whenever the script gets damp, lucky for him, there is very little space to do so. The husbandry gags that the film relies upon for the most part of it, ought to have installed by Reilly and Ferrell and is thoroughly steered by them. From banal notions and hilarious illogical one liners, this comic drama, contradictory to popular beliefs, has witty sense of humor. To pull off your typical dinner-conversation-gone-wrong case with intertwined complicated equations bubbled up by irrevocable actions shines a new light every time. The physical sequences are convincing and flat out hilarious spiced up by irregular yellings of their deepest darkest secrets that tickles you. McKay's clean trial of putting up these two hilarious personas on stand makes us see through and through of their nature which works immensely on dramatic bits no matter how little they are. Ferrell as the shy Mama's boy, obliged but never to admit sort of stature is sculpted on screen by him where his flamboyancy on melting down and cheering up welcomes you to join this unfathomable emotions. Reilly, on the other hand, the impossible to live with guy, is where the antics move accordingly, and his reach to grasp Ferrell's schemes has merits of its own. These two twinkling stars are the heart of the film, if the camera seeks someone else, the energy wears off quickly. Step Brothers feels like real brothers for their constant bickering and petty fights, with all the crisp from surface to the core, this family is fun.","JAN 6, 2019",6.0,comedy

When they all began to settle for their fate, there arises Rocky, an American **** that seems to be able to fly and that breathes new life into the prisoners' dreams of freedom. It's decidedly a remarkable film in every respect. Reminds me of the movie ""The Great Escape"". Personally, I think the creators were inspired a lot in this film to idealize the whole plot. The scenarios are quite detailed and the soundtrack is very good. Technically, stop-motion animation (it's an Aardman Studios movie, and stop-motion is almost a studio tradition) is very good. It's not as good as in newer movies, where other materials were used, but it's positively realistic.","NOV 28, 2018",6.0,comedy

I did find that it was a surprisingly creative movie (whether or not that can attributed to the graphic novel is debatable) and the somewhat big name actors, although playing minor roles throughout the movie, did provide the movie with a needed boost when the plot began to thin.

The Breakfast Club,"I had pretty low expectations for this movie, as I don't really like teen movies. However, I must admit that the film is good and well-made. It's not perfect or exceptional, but it works and entertains without our time being wasted. I can understand why so many people consider this movie a classic, but I don't agree. It's not such a good movie to have that designation, and it has maintained a certain aura to this day, this is due to a certain cult status it has acquired over the years. The film takes place in a school on a Saturday, in which five students who do not know each other will be grounded, each for their own reasons. The teacher, however, is an idiot, and they will end up enjoying the day, listening to music, talking and discovering that they are not so different from each other. The film has weaknesses, starting with the thin script it presents. In fact, there is no story or action here. If the movie didn't have so many humorous scenes or where the characters escape and walk around the school, we would have an hour and a half of dialogue. Another problem is the use of all the most common stereotypes in high school movies: we have an idiotic teacher with no authority, a rebellious student with problems at home, a good student under pressure to have good grades, a beautiful and smug student from a wealthy family, an athletic student with anger issues, and a lonely, weird student. The only thing that saves them is, deep down, the way they gain depth and personality as the dialogues flow. And could I still speak of the illogicality of this punishment, in which five troubled students are left alone in a deserted school? Regardless of the script's weaknesses and other issues, the film has a young cast that does a very committed and interesting job. Of them all, the one who impressed me the most was Judd Nelson, who managed to impart a genuine rebelliousness and irreverence to his character. I also really liked Ally Sheedy. She starts the film almost silently, letting her pose, and bizarre costume dominate our attention, but then she presents us with an intense, intelligent and pleasantly unpleasant and sarcastic character. Anthony Hall has a more palatable and emotional character, which he plays satisfactorily, as do Molly Ringwald and Emilio Estevez, and they also worked well in their respective characters. A word, more, for Paul Gleason, and the impeccable way in which he played a mediocre teacher. Technically, it's a low-key film. It has good cinematography and was very well shot, with sharpness and good colors. It doesn't feature great visual or special effects, but what it brings us is well done and works pleasantly. The library set was well-built, and the school is credible. But what amazes us is, clearly, the soundtrack, and particularly the theme song ""Don't You (Forget About Me)"", which is heard in the credits and which became one of the biggest hits of that decade, in that many were young or (like me) born.","JAN 22, 2022",6.0,comedy

Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,"""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"", with all due respect, is like an ""Existenz"" for dummies; it's as if Allegra Goodman(the game designer from the 1999 David Cronenberg film) sold out and designed a game for kids, a game called ""Ramona's Seven Evil Exes"". The world that these people(avatars, really) exist in, can only be the world of virtual reality, where a guy like Scott Pilgrim(Michael Cera) can stand toe-to-toe with anybody, since brawn is irrelevant in the gaming world. Pilgrim embodies the gamer, the stereotypical gamer who plays video games in order to feel powerful. Whereas most films of this ilk require that the hero should train before going into battle, Scott defeats Ramona Flowers' first ex(Matthew Patel, played by Satya Bhabha) without any training, and with relative ease. A narrative preliminary, a trope that was used as recently as John Turteltaub's ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"", exists in ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" too, but it exists extra-diegetically. The training that enables Scott to defeat all of Ramona's exes is part of the film's backstory, translated into video game parlance, backstory means programming, and herein lies the difference between video games and movies, as ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" suggests the interactive quality of the former, because the avatar(the bassist for a rock band(or is that ""Rock Band""?) and unlikely ladykiller), needs a gamer to do the fighting for him. Nobody on screen seems especially shocked that a man with Scott's physique turned out to be so adept at one-on-one combat; their cipher-like non-reactions to Scott's prodigious fighting ability adds to the virtual reality feel of the diegesis. Everybody comes across as pure character, rather than actual people; puppets being controlled by puppetmasters. While Scott looks like an underdog, he doesn't come across as one, since vulnerability is integral to the underdog's makeup. Instead of shedding blood, the vanquished emit a monetary spray of quarters. Instead of rooting for flesh and blood characters, ""Scott Pilgrim vs. the World"" has the moviegoer rooting for the imaginary gamer, whose wish for a life is fulfilled, as Scott walks off with the girl of his dreams(personally, I would have chosen Knives). In ""Existenz"", the world that Allegra creates goes beyond mere simulacrum, which gives the player the notion that he's getting a life. When Scott says, ""I'm getting a life,"" the film is quietly breaking the fourth wall, because those could be the words of the gamer who lives vicariously through the character he's manipulating.","AUG 13, 2010",6.0,comedy

The Brothers Bloom,"So your watching a movie and it is very character and dialogue driven. Then you suddenly realize that your favorite character in the film hasn't said a word. I would say chances are your not enjoying the film all that much. I sought out The Brothers Bloom after loving Johnson's Looper last year, and liking Brick quite well after that. Hopefully The Brothers Bloom will be a little remembered blip on the directors resume as his career continues. It is the story of two orphaned brothers who at an early age develop a knack for the con. In my opinion a good con movie is hard to pull off. First of all you have to make the audience connect with characters who are doing deplorable things because that is who your story has to center around. I think Johnson does this well enough. Secondly the con needs to be written so the audience understands it, but it fools them. It also must be believable enough that the target would be fooled as well. This is my biggest issue with The Brothers Bloom. The major con is so dull in fact that I had little interest in any twist that would come. Johnson also falls into the annoying habit of twisting the twist. When a director does this too often I don't feel pleasantly fooled anymore, I feel annoyed with the direction the story has taken. The Brothers Bloom does again show off Johnson's ability to build an entertaining world. The characters are entertaining, each with a distinct style. I enjoy Johnson's use of score and music where necessary. Johnson is a stylish filmmaker and that is on full display here. Overall this film just falls short in its story arc, and at the end of the day that is the most important part of a con film.","APR 2, 2013",4.0,comedy

Love Ranch,"Love Ranch is a fictionalized bio-pic, loosely based on the true story of Joe & Sally Conforte. The Conforte's were the first people to open a legalized brothel in the state of Nevada and for a while, became local celebrities, until it all came crashing down. It was an interesting story, following the lives of two people, that most of us don't know anything about. As for the film, while it over-dramatized a lot of the events, it really fails to make much of an impact. There are scenes that make these two look like gangsters, others that make them look like royalty, and several that just makes them look like trailer trash. The truth is that it was hard to really decipher the true character of these people and figure out what they were really like. I was mildly interested in the story, but what I really wanted to see was the return of Joe Pesci. Since retiring in 1999, Pesci had a cameo in one film, but this is was his first leading role since Lethal Weapon 4. For the living legend, it was as if he had never stopped, giving a terrific performance. The only disappointing thing was that they kept Pesci's classic, profanity laced tirades to a minimum, but other than that, he was really terrific. Helen Mirren on the other hands kind of annoyed me in this film. She's always been an amazing actress, but her performance was really all over the place. I guess it has to do with the emotional state of the woman she was playing, but to be honest I was very unimpressed by what I saw from her. While it was great to see Joe Pesci back on the big screen, the Love Ranch was really just a mass of confusion that was all over the place. It was nearly impossible to separate the truth from the Hollywood bull **** when personalities and situations are changing so rapidly. If you love Joe Pesci, you won't want to miss his comeback, but the film that brought him out of retirement, really isn't anything special.","MAR 15, 2014",5.0,comedy

Along Came Polly,Along Came Polly: 4 out of 10: Welcome to Dharma and Greg the movie. Some stupendously unoriginal ideas meet Ben Stiller going to the Farrelly Brothers' well once to often. For example blind sweater wearing ferrets are not funny or cute for that matter and what ganja toking screenwriter would think so. (John Hamburg actually who penned the much funnier Zoolander as well as Meet the Parents) The bathroom humor is not funny and kills the romantic plot. Stiller uses a decorative bath towel instead of toilet paper on a first date with Jennifer Aniston. The fact that they have a second date pushes this movie into the realm of science fiction. I've known woman to end a ten-year marriage for less. Some ideas were funny on their own (Philip Seymour Hoffman's child actor character for example) but not nearly enough are done with them and we are quickly back to Dharma and Greg um excuse me Stiller and Aniston. Actually if it wasn't for Hoffman as well as Alec Baldwin's Jewish boss character and Bryan Brown's Australian eccentric there wouldn't have been much of a laugh during the entire film. It's pretty sad when you are wishing the leads would leave the screen so we can get back to the funny stuff. (Though Anniston does look hot in her PG-13 sex scene. The director (John Hamburg again) cut Debra Messing's rap song as not in tone with the film (seen in deleted scenes). He was right it wasn't in tone with the rest of the film.

Matchstick Men,"A small-scaled change-of-pace for director Ridley Scott after his run of high-profile extravaganzas “Gladiator,” “Hannibal” and “Black Hawk Down,” “Matchstick Men” is a coldly crafty character piece about some seriously quirky L.A. scam artists. Odd mixture of ultra-sleek visuals, psychological probing, “Paper Moon”-like father-daughter swindling, self-improvement efforts and abrupt tough-guy stuff keeps the picture percolating, even if it seems too artificial to genuinely convince on an emotional or dramatic level. Based on a novel by Eric Garcia — author of the “Rex” dinosaur-disguised-as-a-detective novels — script by “Ocean’s 11” scenarist Ted Griffin and his brother Nicholas feels like a companion piece of sorts to “Catch Me if You Can” in its breezy approach to the con game laced with more serious father-sprig ramifications. Comparisons to Spielberg’s recent hit extend even to the style of the opening credits and the heavy use of upbeat, jazzy tunes featuring the likes of Sinatra and Bobby Darin. But unlike the high-flying Frank Abagnale in “Catch,” the title characters here are strictly low-rent grifters. Senior member of the team, Roy Waller (Nicolas Cage), is a world-class neurotic, a nervous-tick-ridden neatnik who hasn’t had a personal relationship in years and assumes a commanding air of authority only when conning some poor **** over the phone or posing as a Federal Trade Commission official in order to obtain a family’s bank account number. His partner Frank (Sam Rockwell) is a more recognizably scummy operator, a young man on the make who’s equally at home hustling a high roller as he is talking a little old lady out of her life savings. Working out of a small office in an anonymous part of Los Angeles, the odd couple makes ends meet with their little scams, but hasn’t yet landed a big score. Much of the early-going is devoted to elaborate detailing of Roy’s obsessive habits, such as manically cleaning his impersonal ’50s-style home and counting to three before opening a door. Even these amusingly banal activities are leant a dark visual splendor by the imaginative images conjured by Scott and lenser John Mathieson, who have worked overtime to divide their blue-and-black-dominated compositions into horizontal and vertical patterns with the set details and slatted light. Acknowledging to his new shrink (a very good Bruce Altman) that he may have a 14-year-old kid by his ex-wife, who was pregnant when they split, the reluctant Roy allows the doc to investigate, leading to the disturbed man’s nervous first meeting with Angela (Alison Lohman). At first glance a normal skateboarding, backpack-wearing kid, Angela seems delighted to meet her dad, whom she’d always been told was an imprisoned criminal. Announcing that she’s “taken off” from her mom for a couple of days, she settles in with Roy, whose initial pose of being an antique dealer soon crumbles as the truth comes out. For most of the way, Scott keeps the mood jaunty and lightly engaging in an unforced manner. Much of this stems from the sheer eccentricity of Cage’s character, an intense agoraphobe with a frequently twitching left eye whose mania for cleanliness would make Felix Unger look like Oscar Madison. Cage adds to the physical manifestations of Roy’s instability with some fearsome rages and amusing attempts to behave as he imagines a dad should; his efforts at being an authoritarian are quite funny. It’s a showy and adept perf in a role that requires Cage to hopscotch abruptly, often from one level to another. Rockwell, whose Chuck Barris in “Confessions of a Dangerous Mind” allegedly pulled much bigger scams for considerably larger stakes, seems right at home as the raffish Frank, who’s presented with no extra dimensions. It’s left to Lohman, so impressive in “White Oleander,” to provide a little heft, which she does by investing Angela with a sympathetically charged mix of youthful toughness and vulnerability; pic picks up notably whenever she’s onscreen. Although yarn ends on an agreeably human note that suggests growth and potential as well as disappointment for those left on the short end of the con, “Matchstick Men” never really casts off its cloak of artificiality and calculation; its pleasures are minor, however distracting they may be. Obviously inspired by Nino Rota in lighthearted Fellini mode, Hans Zimmer’s score pushes hard to establish an effervescent mood. As usual with Scott’s films, this one is immaculately appointed in all departments, with Tom Foden’s production design combining with a decision to generally avoid familiar L.A. landmarks in order achieve a feel of Anywheresville, U.S.A.","MAR 26, 2016",6.0,comedy

The Fisher King,"Originally an allegory of how humanity is waiting for its savior, “The Fisher King” is a story about a man so driven by fame and power, that he can’t look past his own nose. The protagonist, Jack, is unable to consider the thoughts or feelings of others, until an un-empowered man (the Fisher King is a representation of those of us who are “castrated” and unable to produce or fend for ourselves) enters his life, giving him the opportunity of redemption. The movie is, in itself, a creative and meaningful adaptation of the mythological tale, but is very poorly scripted, often leading the viewer into frustration, annoyance, apathy and disregard. Robin Williams was an incredible talent; his mind was constantly creating in an incessant unease; possibly brought on by a feverous need for acceptance and meaning. Like for many of us, comedy was a mandatory survival tactic for Robin, but he went further, eventually thriving upon it. Sadly, “The Fisher King” fails to tread the delicate balance between drama and comedy, and understandably, since the two are incredibly different. Robin’s relentless energy is misplaced and poorly directed, often presented at pivotal points of emotion or danger, instead of properly and timely at appropriate moments in the plot. Terry Gilliam fails to temper Robin’s antics, shape a proper homeless lunatic, or present believable social interactions. This movie definitely did not merit award, but was still able to pull off many, including the Oscar, eventually becoming the only so honored movie in Gilliam’s repertoire (how did his movie “Brazil” not get noticed?). Despite the intriguing premise and exceptional cast, “The Fisher King” is unable to rise above mediocrity, weighed down heavily by its horrendously wordy and meaningless script. Writer Richard LaGravenese either allowed the actors free reign or butchered the dialogue. Other aspects of the film are basically flawless, such as Roger Pratt’s unique cinematography, as well as sound, music and editing. Depth and meaning are also presented correctly in the film. For example, the fact that Jack wears Parry’s clothing in order to retrieve the grail is symbolic of his triumph of being able to walk in Parry’s shoes. A massive achievement for Jack, who was unable to respect or understand others before this friendship. In conclusion, “The Fisher King” is probably a movie worth watching in the background, while doing something else.","APR 26, 2023",6.0,comedy

Instead we spend most of the movie in the human world focusing on the boring humans. Beetlejuice is cool when he is on screen but its barely little. More afterlife and Beetlejuice could’ve gone a long way in helping this movie. Instead we have pretty stupid with movie with some dumb characters. When its cool its cool and I guess I’m glad I saw it but I feel like ti could’ve been more than just some cool spectacle here and there.","OCT 15, 2014",6.0,comedy

If Pixar carry on making weepies then they are gonna have to do a lot of catching up. Come on Pixar! I take my kid out to have a good time! Which reminds me... Inside Out is a talkie, probably contains the most dialogue out of any Pixar movie, probably why my daughter was bored. It really didnt feel like the movie was for kids at all. As it stands...

The Brothers Bloom,"So your watching a movie and it is very character and dialogue driven. Then you suddenly realize that your favorite character in the film hasn't said a word. I would say chances are your not enjoying the film all that much. I sought out The Brothers Bloom after loving Johnson's Looper last year, and liking Brick quite well after that. Hopefully The Brothers Bloom will be a little remembered blip on the directors resume as his career continues. It is the story of two orphaned brothers who at an early age develop a knack for the con. In my opinion a good con movie is hard to pull off. First of all you have to make the audience connect with characters who are doing deplorable things because that is who your story has to center around. I think Johnson does this well enough. Secondly the con needs to be written so the audience understands it, but it fools them. It also must be believable enough that the target would be fooled as well. This is my biggest issue with The Brothers Bloom. The major con is so dull in fact that I had little interest in any twist that would come. Johnson also falls into the annoying habit of twisting the twist. When a director does this too often I don't feel pleasantly fooled anymore, I feel annoyed with the direction the story has taken. The Brothers Bloom does again show off Johnson's ability to build an entertaining world. The characters are entertaining, each with a distinct style. I enjoy Johnson's use of score and music where necessary. Johnson is a stylish filmmaker and that is on full display here. Overall this film just falls short in its story arc, and at the end of the day that is the most important part of a con film.","APR 2, 2013",4.0,comedy

Fire Island,"The dynamics do not go beyond the superficial, and perhaps as much as it can be argued that its intention is not to go into any depth at all, that also highlights the lack of substance provided. There are bits and pieces of humor that work in scattered moments but don't really make up for the rest of the events that unfold on screen. As I said, what Fire Island wants to be is just fun before anything else and I assume that a certain part of the audience will accept it that way and there will be those who won't. After all it needs to be consumed in those terms for you to get a better deal out of it, because what this film doesn't achieve is to give variation to a tired genre.","JUN 13, 2022",5.0,comedy
Wedding Crashers,"The movie itself stars Vince Vaughn (as Jeremy Grey) and Owen Wilson (as John Beckwith) as two lawyers who spend their free time gate crashing at weddings to pull women, basically. However, when they do this at one of the biggest weddings of the year, things change when John breaks one of the 'Wedding Crasher Rules' and does the unthinkable in falling for the daughter of the US secretary of treasury, (who's played by Chrstopher Walken), which leaves Jeremy in a rather awkward situation being stuck with his sister, Gloria, who is what they'd call a 'stage five clinger', (who's played by Isla Fisher). This results in some pretty awkward situations when Jeremy joins John at the families large estate for a weekend. Some of the things that happen during this weekend that of course subsequently don't go to plan include a game of football and, of all things, quail hunting. Poor Jeremy doesn't fare well in between the different activites that go on, with the rather OTT (over the top) sister playing some pretty cruel and strange games with him, including at one point he wakes up during the night to find himself handcuffed to the bed (and it only gets stranger from there). Suffice to say, Jeremy doesn't much enjoy the weekend and comes off alot worse than John does. This is a rather off the wall kind of movie, one that would probably appeal to alot of men, though I have to say I didn't find it as amusing as I'd hoped I might. It is pretty predictable in some aspects, there are some fairly slapstick moments that made me chuckle but in between and for the most part I thought that the movie was a bit too long winded and a bit too cliched in some respects. The sisters character, Gloria, and the 'forced couple' of Jeremy and her is shown as an example of a complete opposite to John and Claire, the secretary of treasury's daughter, who get more serious and John wishes to commit more, the further into the movie it gets, (which of course somewhat angers Jeremy as this means that to stay by his best friend, he has to stay around the rather crazy sister Gloria). However, eventually Jeremy appears to change his mind about Gloria and starts to have feelings for her. This certainly isn't a serious movie at all and should be taken for what it is, even though I still cringed a bit at Gloria's character and at the two 'Wedding Crashers' for their behaviour sometimes. Gloria is a very OTT character but the naivety that appears to be there gets taken advantage of by Jeremy which at some level annoyed me, until it became clear in the movie that she seemingly isn't so much naive but more just plain crazy or, yup, you guessed it, way OTT! I think this comedy does have some laughs but it depends on what your taste is in these kind of movies I guess. Its somewhat similar to Meet The Family and/or Meet The **** I'd say, although not as funny as those movies and where the two main character are concerned, alot more arrogance obviously at the start of the movie. To start with I thought this is very much a guys movie, although I think as it progresses and with what happens towards the end of it, things change and there's the somewhat usual or typical Hollywood 'thing' where one of them sees how their ways were probably wrong... This is a semi original story but it just doesn't really work all that well I thought, the actors are good but ultimately I thought the story was flawed by the lack of substance. The story feels a bit too formulaic and potentially predictable, don't get me wrong there are some funny moments and the acting is good and so on but to me, it just didn't appeal as much as I'd hoped it might... I think perhaps its was over hyped in the media, giving me higher expectations than I should have had. Possibly one for the guys. I'm rating it satisfactory as the DVD contains a good amount of extras and you can buy it pretty cheap and the movie isn't entirely dire but it could definitely be better, in my opinion. I'd say that if your into this kind of movie, you can find funnier ones. At least to me, it didn't appeal as much as I'd hoped it would. This is a movie that guys are more likely to enjoy and that appeals to more at the start. Its a bit too 'Hollywood-ised' I thought and I thought the basic story was a bit too flimsy, with not much added to it to back it up throughout (if you know what I mean).","NOV 27, 2021",5.0,comedy

About Time,"About Time takes place in the cosy romantic Britain of Richard Curtis, where nervous middle class Englishmen fall head over heels for gorgeous American women. Curtis paints an idealised London of lawyers, playwrights, art galleries and vintage fashion. In the midst of it all is aspiring young lawyer Tim (Domhnall Gleeson), who arrives in the capital with new ambition, and a new ability. For Tim has just been told the family secret by his father (Bill Nighy). He, along with all the other men in his family, is a time traveller, and can rewrite his own history by travelling back to any point along his own timeline (but no killing ****). Nighy’s matter-of-fact exposition on this matter starts the film; along with Tim’s natural incredulity, it is a comic highlight. But this is a Richard Curtis project, and Tim’s future is not a chronicle of epic destiny, but a chance for him to finally meet the girl of his dreams. She arrives swiftly in the form of the expatriated Mary (Rachel McAdams). Gleeson shines as an atypical leading man, red haired, slightly gangly; at once identifiable and appealing to the audience. McAdams is pleasant, but her character is given little to do. Notably, she never discovers Tim’s big secret. Much of the humour comes from Tim’s courtship of Mary, during which he repeats awkward encounters and must meet her for the first time more than once (including a memorable date in London’s famously pitch-black Dans le Noir restaurant, a nifty cinematic experiment). The approach is reminiscent of that other great time travelling romantic comedy, the thoroughly brilliant Groundhog Day (1993). But Tim has a blessing, not a curse, and with complete control over his path, approaches with less cynicism and more “Let’s try that again, shall we?” So the blend of time travel with a romantic comedy is not entirely original. There is also an inevitable comparison with The Time Traveller’s Wife (2009), which also starred Rachel McAdams. Maybe she’s stuck in a time loop herself. As for specifics, the film directly asks you not to question it too much. “We don’t seem to have destroyed civilisation yet” says Nighy. Some rules rear their head as the narrative progresses, but it’s hard to know what the boundaries actually are, and I just watched Primer (2004). This is not a film about time travel, but a romantic comedy in which time travel furthers the plot. But it is about time: how we choose to spend it, and who we choose to spend it with. And while it’s a romance on the face of things, the more interesting relationship, and certainly the more poignant, is between Tim and his father. At times, it’s unashamedly sentimental. The entire film has a softness to it that makes you wonder if Curtis smeared Vaseline on the lens. Curtis even manages to turn a potentially day ruining downpour into a fresh and glorious celebration. The strength of the writing is in the ability to remain unexpected, and some of this is naturally due to the ability of time travel to allow unexpected things to happen. Conflict appears in unlikely places, and least of all in the relationship between Gleeson and McAdams. It’s not perfect, but for all the derivative and saccharine elements, the central father-son relationship is eloquent, and something rarely explored in this way, especially with this level of British reserve. Though the script is witty, it is only peppered with outright comedy (this is still gold, from the versatile Tom Hollander, fantastic as a jaded slovenly playwright, to Tim’s swift cycle through a series of potential best men, complete with appropriate speeches). Being relatively unfamiliar with his previous works (aside from classic television shows Blackadder and The Vicar of Dibley) About Time has at the very least inspired me to investigate Richard Curtis’s other films, which are apparently much stronger.","NOV 16, 2013",6.0,comedy

The Emperor's New Groove,"Kuzco is the young, selfish, and overly-pampered emperor of the Inca Empire who lives the high-life and routinely punishes those who displease him, such as having an elderly man defenestrated for the crime of ""throwing off his groove"". When he fires his conniving adviser Yzma for attempting to run the country behind his back, she, along with her muscular but clumsy and oafish henchman Kronk, plots to take the throne. Kuzco meets with Pacha, a kind peasant and village leader, and tells him that he plans to demolish his hilltop family home to build himself a lavish summer home called ""Kuzcotopia"". Pacha protests, but is quickly dismissed. That evening, Yzma hosts a dinner where she plans to poison Kuzco, but due to a mislabeled vial, Kronk inadvertently spikes Kuzco's wine with the wrong potion, turning him into a llama instead. After knocking Kuzco out, Yzma orders Kronk to dispose of him in a river. However, after doing so, Kronk has a crisis of conscience at the last second and saves Kuzco, but misplaces him on a cart belonging to Pacha. Upon returning home, Pacha does not tell his family about Kuzco's decision. After awakening from the bag on the cart and scaring Pacha, Kuzco blames Pacha for his transformation and orders Pacha to return him to the palace. Pacha agrees, but only if Kuzco agrees to build Kuzcotopia elsewhere. Kuzco refuses the offer and decides to go by himself against Pacha's warnings, but quickly ends up getting chased through the jungle by a pack of black jaguars. Pacha arrives to rescue him, and extends his offer a second time, to which Kuzco seemingly accepts. The two survive many ordeals in the jungle, and Pacha finds that Kuzco has a good side to him underneath his selfishness. Meanwhile, Yzma takes the throne, but is angered to learn from Kronk that Kuzco is still alive, so the two set out to find him. In the jungle, Kronk takes directions from Bucky, a squirrel with whom Kuzco had an unpleasant encounter while walking through the jungle alone. The next day, the pairs arrive at a jungle diner at the same time, unaware of each other's presence. While Kuzco complains to the cook, Pacha overhears Yzma's plan and attempts to warn Kuzco when he returns, but he doesn't believe Pacha, thinking he is beloved by his people, and reveals that he intended to renege on his promise to spare Pacha's home. However, Kuzco soon overhears Yzma's and Kronk's plot of attempting to kill him and learns that no one in his kingdom misses him due to his selfishness. Feeling guilty and unwanted, Kuzco leaves the diner on his own, planning on living out the rest of his life as a normal llama. Pacha catches up, still willing to help Kuzco return to normal after knowing his life is in danger. Kuzco reconciles with him before they set off to Pacha's house for supplies. Upon arriving, Yzma is already there, searching for the two. Pacha has his family delay Yzma, giving him and Kuzco a head-start back to the palace, intending to enter Yzma's lab and find a potion to reverse the effects of the llama potion. However, they are ambushed by Yzma and Kronk, who somehow made it back ahead of Kuzco and Pacha. Yzma then orders Kronk to kill the duo. When Kronk hesitates, Yzma insults him by revealing that his spinach puffs disgust her, hurting his feelings and prompting him to betray her, but she drops him down a trapdoor. She then summons the palace guards and claims that Pacha and Kuzco murdered the emperor, forcing them to flee with an armful of vials containing various animal potions (Yzma deliberately knocked them all to the floor so that Kuzco and Pacha could not tell which one is correct), which they use to transform Kuzco during the chase. Pacha also knocks a table of flasks containing other animal potions into the pursuing guards, turning them into various animals. As they are cornered on the ledges **** wall structure, they are left with two remaining vials. Yzma and Kuzco struggle over the vials, accidentally crushing one and transforming Yzma into a small kitten. Pacha and Kuzco use teamwork to reach the other vial. Yzma snatches it, but as she gloats over her victory, she is abruptly and inadvertently crushed by a secret exit opened by Kronk (who has found his way out of the trapdoor passage), dropping the vial directly into Pacha's hand. Pacha gives Kuzco the vial, and Kuzco, after expressing his gratitude to Pacha, drinks the potion. Some time later, a restored Kuzco, having reflected on the consequences of his selfishness and made amends, takes Pacha's suggestion of moving Kuzcotopia over to a neighboring and unoccupied hill. Kuzco then joins Pacha and his family at his modest and smaller resort while elsewhere, Kronk has become a scoutleader and trains a new batch of scouts, including Yzma, who is still a kitten.","MAY 24, 2020",6.0,comedy
The Ice Harvest,"When two low level mafia members are frustrated with their roles, they come up with a plan to steal two million dollars from their boss. Everything goes off without a hitch, and now, they just have to wait one night before they can get out of town and move on to a new life, but things are never that simple. The Ice Harvest was an interesting film, with a great cast, and had they been able to pull off what they were attempting to do, it would have been a classic. Producers decided to make this film a modern day, 1930's type noir film, but at the same time, they wanted to mock how cheesy and over the top these films could be. It was a great idea, but it didn't work because the mocking wasn't subtle. In fact, the film takes it so far, that it becomes exactly what they were trying to make fun of in the first place. John Cusack stars and he can make any film better. This guy can play anyone and is always amazing, I just can't understand why he doesn't take on bigger roles. Here he's paired with Billy Bob Thornton, who under the right circumstances, can be hilarious. While he was pretty funny, he has almost no chemistry with Cusack and that hurt the film. These guys were partners, but on completely opposite pages and it just doesn't work. The Ice Harvest was an interesting story and I wish they had been able to pull off what they were attempting to do, but very quickly the film becomes a farce of itself, brutally predictable, and simply a waste of time.","MAR 13, 2015",5.0,comedy
Some Like It Hot,"I can see the appeal of this movie, especially for its time. It is well executed and the acting is great. Many of the comedic scenes are original and it is remains light throughout. However, it pains me to say I just did not find myself being immersed or laughing very often, perhaps it was too light for my taste. Even comedies have a level of tension, suspense, character development, intended to pull you in, be invested at what is at stake, but I did not feel that here so much.","FEB 29, 2020",6.0,comedy

Meanwhile, the main human is almost totally devoid of any personality, and the main female human (who personality is Strawman Feminist) is inexplicably in love with him. The little things are better than the whole: the visualization of taste, the gloomy critic. I honestly wonder if this did so well among the critics because this movie ends by demeaning critics who write negative reviews.","JUL 4, 2018",6.0,comedy

Mr. & Mrs. Smith,"This definately isn't an exercise in realism but hey, how many people particularly want that when they go to the movies or go to see a film? I thought it was still pretty enjoyable, if not very daft, in a high action drama/comedy way. There is a fair amount of violence and particularly gun use present in this movie, which of course is pretty much necessary and a pretty obvious element, given the story but I thought its worth mentioning as its shown in quite a blase way and I wouldn't recommend this movie be shown to kids, though it is rated 15 anyway, which is about right. I thought the movie didn't really take itself seriously and rightly so, it definately has a sort of a slapstick feel about it. The acting was solid, which I fully expected and there's a good amount of eye candy, with Angelina Jolie for the guys (there's one particular scene where she's dressed up in a dominatrix costume, which im guessing will interest/excite alot of men) and Brad Pitt for the women, though personally I prefer Vince Vaughn, who also appears in this movie as John's friend Eddie. This is probably a film more for the guys I would have thought, with the gun blazing action scenes and the presence of Ms Jolie, though thats not to say that women can't or won't enjoy it too. There are some fairly farcical moments and its definately true to say that again, this movie shouldn't be see as being all about a solid story because it isn't really, more will be interested in seeing what was talked about in the press at the time as being the start of Pitt & Jolie's relationship in real life. There is definately chemistry to be seen there, whether its just good acting, eh, ill leave that up to you to decide. The movie is perhaps a little slow to really 'get going' but once it does, it stays there, if you know what I mean. At the end of the movie, there's a long drawn out shooting match between John & Jane and any number of rival assassins who want the bounty on their heads. Will they get out of it alive? do you really care? well, you can make your own mind up about that! it really is rather over the top and I suppose part of its daftness is that in a way it does take itself a bit too seriously but hey, it works alright as something fairly diverting to watch to while away an evening.","NOV 27, 2021",5.0,comedy
Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay,"This film soo disgusting!! Funny Enough but don't Let the Boobs too more. I really didn't think the first Harold and Kumar movie was all that good, I would rate it at around 6 out of 10, maybe 7, but at least it had more than one funny part. In this sequel the only funny part, to me anyway, was the scenes with George W in the secret room. Other than this, it just plain **** ass. The filmmakers seemed to rely on gross gags with little or no build up and while I like many films that are stupid/gross, I just could not like this one.

Scott Pilgrim vs. the World,"Hmm.. Entertainment Weekly called this: ""The first rock & roll kung fu videogame youth love story."" ..and that feels very much accurate. But what is it beyond that?

It merely tickled me at best. Like another User Reviewer, it seemed to me like Knives was the most likeable character with Ramona never deserving of her goddess-like status from Scott. Speaking of who, as much as I like Michael Cera, especially when he's challenged by roles such as Youth In Revolt, this was possibly the weakest thing I've seen him in. Supposedly he played a a gaming-hero ladykiller, but I couldn't ever see him as anything else but a wimp from start to finish. Scott Pilgrim Vs The World was what I'd describe as a bubblegum film - slightly chewy, brightly coloured, and easily disposable. I didn't hate it, but I far from loved it.","JUL 31, 2011",6.0,comedy

The Cable Guy,"Stiller shouldn't have worried about the viewers, the character gets unchecked, more importantly Carrey isn't directed. The Cable Guy Stiller has good intentions. He treats his lead as a comic book hero. Unfortunately, he forgets to craft the world in a fantasy land. Now, the director Ben Stiller intends it to be in contrast to each other, the character and the world that doesn't accept or eyes him. This was his window for the laughs. And that is where even the script cheats him. There is this obsession of grounding these characters in a more pragmatic way. Which creates the ultimate tug of war that leaves the film hanging in the air empty handed. The other issue is how much time is spent upon building up the antics and the moments that drives those antics. A lot of cinematography too is directed towards the punch line of a joke. The scenarios are set separately for them, like waiting for Jim Carrey's reaction or the procedure of working hard on something that is about to be mutilated by someone else, the film thrives for such elements and as a result adds up extra irrelevant ten minutes on screen. So why is this that the film has aged well culturally? First of all, it deals with the social rigmarole that everyone goes through. And something that we all can connect instantly especially the track it follows, not only is it catchy but the film grows how it was promised to be. And center of this affection is led by Carrey's eccentric performance. He embodies the character so gleefully that it is almost as if he has been waiting to play a kooky personality as such his whole life. To be frank, it is a juicy role. Any character would love to play The Cable Guy, he has got a wide range that marginally hovers around being funny and wrong, there is a fine line to walk here.","JUN 21, 2019",4.0,comedy

First, Michael Cera is a one trick pony. Being the geeky kid trying to gain the love of the hot girl has been overdone for him. Second, the hipster video game thing only appeals to a small number of people. I'm one of them and this movie was not impressive. The story was trite and silly with unfunny characters who pop in a few good one liners every now and then. The fighting was original and entertaining but did not fit. It seemed like it was thrown in for this-looks-cool reason. The video game references were cute but more silly than artistic. Which is what I can say for the movie as a whole.

Down with Love,"Loud colours. Cheap insulting jokes. Cheesy set. Cartoonish production and costume designing. And one of my favourite love stories. Down With Love This could be my favourite outing that resides in the director Peyton Reed's world or filmography. And mind you Peyton Reed gave us Marvel's light hearted superhero and still this film remains to be the one that feels ""out of this world"". It is one of those films that will stay with you for weeks. Popping on your hand like some jewellery piece that you saw by the window and can't wait to buy. It grabs you by your collar and rattles your body like a puppet until you fall merrily to the set rules by the maker. The film feels extremely simple and it goes to tremendous lengths to prove its simplicity. And how binary can it make your life. And even while doing so, even while weaving out various complicated theories and set pieces, it never gets difficult to swallow. ""Don't close your eyes"" is what's order around Ewan McGregor playing a powerful name in the city and ""Open your eyes"" is what's whispered around Renee Zellweger who's humility is catching on fire. This balance of two different worlds is euphorically attractive. You cannot not love the way these guys talk. The conversations are incredibly funny and wrong. Deliberately wrong. It is important you figure that out quickly. You should be aware of the kind of jokes that cheers up the makers. And it is not the properties, characteristics of the characters nor the situational humor that fits in on the narration. Things should rhyme and remain symmetric, no matter what the circumstances are. Now this is the subtexted ongoing joke in the film. You better get ready to follow this system or this is going to be a bad day for you. Down With Love never goes down, actually. You'd think that it would be a disadvantage. You are wrong.","NOV 3, 2019",6.0,comedy
Beetlejuice,"Bottom line: Classic Tim Burton film that makes for a solid evening around Halloween. Adam (Baldwin) and Barbara (Davis) Maitland are a young, recently married couple. They are vacationing at home and make the quick trip to the local hardware store. On their way back they crash off a bridge into a river. Somehow, they walk back to their house (though they don’t exactly remember how) and, drenched, they try to dry off and warm next to the fire they don’t remember starting. They soon realize they drowned in the river and are now ghosts. They still want to try and live, or exist, happily in their home. Unfortunately, a new family (the Deetz’s) from New York buys the house and starts to move in. The Maitland’s decide to haunt the house to scare away the unwelcome residents. After repeated failures, they resort to calling Betelgeuse (Keaton), a freelancer who turns out to be far more trouble than he’s worth. Beetle Juice is, for me, one of those movies that you actually sit down and watch once but you see it in parts here and there. I first saw Beetle Juice when I was little and I thought it was creepy and somehow depressing. After re-watching it just the other day, I still think it is creepy and depressing but I will say that it is good. The acting is really rather good. I had forgotten that it was starring a very young Alec Baldwin. As soon as he spoke, I did a double take and thought, “I think I recognize that amazing voice.” Michael Keaton does a really good job at creating Betelgeuse a unique character. I didn’t realize it was him until I looked at the credits. It was like learning that Tim Curry played Pennywise the Clown in Stephen King’s It. It is a combination of makeup and acting to create something new. Winona Ryder fits perfectly into the aesthetic of the film. It made me wonder why she didn’t do more stuff with Tim Burton. Beetle Juice is one of the few movies that ends with a dancing sequence that I don’t particularly find offensive. Lydia received an “A” on her Chemistry paper so the Maitland’s possess the house so it plays Harry Belafonte’s “Jump In The Line” and possess Lydia to make her float in the air and dance. Many of the dancing sequences I’ve seen use the opportunity to cycle through the characters as they dance to show their status. In Beetle Juice, we cycle through the characters but they aren’t dancing. They are just doing what they would normally be doing: Lydia’s mom is sculpting some modern art and Lydia’s father is reading. It is mildly silly but it isn’t going for a zany ending. Overall, I’d recommend Beetle Juice if you haven’t seen it before but, considering it has been on TV about a million times, you probably have. Would I recommend you see it again? If it is Halloween time, sure, why not? It isn’t a scary movie and in terms of humor, it’s alright. I didn’t laugh out loud but chuckled here and there.","AUG 30, 2015",6.0,comedy

Mr. & Mrs. Smith,"Romantic comedies usually not please everyone, much less when disguised as action films like this. The basic idea of this film is a fight between husband and wife, secret agents of rival agencies have to kill each other. The idea is excellent for a film of this genre, but Simon Kinberg's script was not able to develop in a natural and effective way. The result is a rather scrappy movie where every scene look like a sort of ""excuse"" to justify the action scenes, quite hilarious, between the couple. The couple is played by Bradd Pitt and Angelina Jolie. About them can be said that they knew not disappoint the audience and were at the height of the characters and the film. They are two extremely talented actors who combine talent to physical beauty, and scenes where both participate, interacting with each other, in a more or less friendly but always passionate way, are worthy of anthology, not only because they can combine and comedy and action but also by showing excellent meshing with one another. The special visual and sound effects are basically the standard of Hollywood, not the least bit surprised the public. Guns, shooting everywhere, explosions, martial arts, car chases ... in a way, the film looks like a parody of action films, exhibiting comically most of its cliche's. If that was the intention, it is excellent. Moreover, the film is basically pure entertainment, without great concern for anything else other than the right mix of action and comedy.","APR 24, 2018",4.0,comedy
Elf,"A Chaotic Christmas. Elf Favreau's take on Christmas does exactly what such feature demands, a lot of magic, a lot of love and a whole lot of innocence flooding across the screen. The first act being of course dipped in irony, as a whole new magical world is projected where most of the jokes are pulled out from the fact that there is a variation in their bodies compared to our protagonist. And this is a theme that never does and would end, from visiting a new city to street, jumping in on new lifestyle, every aspect of it is being mocked at through comparisons. The rest of the structure is familiar, with antics that helps advance the storyline, the humor is never offered in extreme, there is a broad smile on your face throughout the journey; this is Favreau's big win, gullible in its own world and characters, a film has never been so satisfied with itself. As far as gags are concerned it can easily be left to Ferrell himself. His knack of eating too much sugar, his physical comedy, his way of dancing and picking up the phone by saying, ""This is Buddy Help. What is your favourite color?""; it all bodes well. His commitment of pinning himself down to that amount of childishness is what fuels this film. Favreau has few ideas on his minds that makes him push the boundaries on an emotional level, unfortunately this is where the film gets dodgy, there is very little art for them to draw out the emotions. Favreau should have known better to keep the film light and breezy, for that is where the film shines, a happy go lucky attitude is what it thrives upon. Elf has more human in him, it lops off few taboo subjects, and give you a decent simpler miracle.","JAN 25, 2019",4.0,comedy

Inside Out,"My First film review on Metacritic - I'm a movie goer but I don't really care enough to comment on most. Inside Out - I've watched pretty much every Pixar film there is, having a young daughter means we watch anything that comes up. This years 'HOME' by dream-works my daughter is still currently obsessed with, and I've watched it well over 100 times sort-of-thing... painful but it's bearable still today, just! I was hoping for much the same from Pixars latest offering. For me, an Adult, this film was either a 9 or a 10. There's a lot of in-humour aimed at parents and I was happy to laugh at these parts, but my god, for a children's film, this is one onslaught of misery. My daughter finished watching this film confused and I think genuinely upset. The plot is a growing-of-age story whereby the main character, an eleven year old girl, moves towns and loses everything that her former home had with it. The main charisma character that controls her brain alongside 'sadness' get lost in her long-term memory, and from thereon it's one bad thing happening after another to the main character as the personalities left controlling her brain fail in every situation after, while the lost items themselves stumble from one tragic loss to the next, such as losing the memory of her childhood friend (who is literally erased from existence) - I'm not keen on death as a theme within kids films, it's not easily approached and leads to uncomfortable questions. I'm rating this film down as it's not really a kids film at all. I think of those films I watched over and over in my childhood (which haven't become sad memories now!!) and they all had that Spielberg magic, charm and adventure.

Al Pacino happily pulls the chestnuts out of the fire with the brilliance and relaxation that we know from him in the role of the lonely director who shoots shit for the Cannes and Sundance festivals distributed according to even and odd years so that every time the idiots always have some intellectual shit to ""watch""! So Al gives us a mix of Fellini and Almodovar with a bit of Woody Allen thrown in: a real fucking festival, especially with his digitized blonde who looks like it came straight out of an old Seat advert (Auto emocion!) let good old Al pilot with a Kinect prototype...! Some moments are well thought out and quite funny despite from time to time a disbelief that is less and less obvious to mask: the Wizard of Oz rows a little with his Pentium like this scenario which is not sparing in adventures but which gets lost a little far, sometimes, bordering on buffoonery.

But we have to admit, Serial Noceurs works! Whether it's the headliners (Wilson and Vaughn, however, subscribe to this kind of film, especially for the worst), the supporting roles (Rachel McAdams radiant, Christopher Walken delectable, Bradley Cooper brilliant...) and especially the majority of gags and lines, funny despite their scabrous appearance. Well, of course, the second part of the film, just like every American comedy, this affair sinks into the good feelings and the happy ending which are nevertheless dispensable, somewhat spoiling the whole, in my opinion very pleasant and even touching at times.","FEB 12, 2012",6.0,comedy
Fire Island,"If you're looking for a predictable, formulaic, episodic **** rom-com full of cliched stereotypes, then this is the movie for you. The opening act of director Andrew Ahn's summertime road trip tale about a troupe of shallow party boys (most of whose characters are seriously underdeveloped) to the infamous **** resort off the coast of Long Island is so cloying that the temptation to shut it off is almost impossible to ignore. With laughs few and far between and an overall approach that plays more like an introduction to the **** lifestyle for uninitiated heterosexual audiences than a bona fide piece of legitimately engaging LGBTQ+ cinema, viewer patience is seriously tried almost from the outset. That's especially true for **** audience members who've themselves seen (and probably experienced firsthand) material like this countless times before. While there's an anemic attempt to fuse some depth into the story during the second half with its nods to Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice,"" it's not enough to salvage a project that's obviously trying to tap into the Gay Pride Month demographic in hopes of milking it for all its worth. Given the wealth of better **** movies out there (such as Bill Sherwood's far superior ""Parting Glances"" (1986) with its numerous Fire Island references), it's easy to understand how this one bypassed theaters and went straight (no pun intended) to streaming.","JUN 6, 2022",4.0,comedy

Freaks of Nature,"Respond to Avengers? All the folklore characters in one place! A much better film than I expected. There's everything in it, all the popular folklore characters in one screen. In addition to that the aliens have also made into it, totally something new. Do think only Marvels bring all its superheroes in one place, see this some B movie did it as well. Since you know where this film belongs, I mean like a second string film, you should expect to a same level in order to enjoy it. First, the writer and director did a good job, followed by the actors. There were three main characters and they were distinct from each other. The supporting cast as well, so good, many decently known names were in that. The story as well had some good twists, since so many concepts was merged, predicting the scenes were kind of impossible. Anytime anything might happen, but overall it was a very well done film. So an enjoyable film with a few laughs. It is the best year so for if you like B movies, Recent films like 'Cooties', 'Scouts Guide...' and a few others, you won't get a treat like this every year. They all are not top notch, but very entertaining, even if you rate them average. So what I'm saying is, this film is not those big production house's big projects, but it delivered to its capacity and you must keep that in your mind while watching it. I can't suggest it, but I hope you watch it. 6/10","SEP 28, 2016",6.0,comedy

Black Dynamite,"Black Dynamite is a movie that executes the spoof genre in the utterly correct way to create a parody. With its vintage-style appearance and 70s style soundtrack, the film performs in a way that resembles the old martial arts movies that were popularized back in the day. Although its style is its strong point, there are large lapses between the laughs. There are enormous instances of humor in a lot of the one-liners and monologues, but unfortunately those entice long waits of slow dialogue. Overall, this film packs bits of action and humor, but it is apparent that it is flawed with its lack of movement in wittiness and in dialogue.","SEP 27, 2010",5.0,comedy

Galaxy Quest,"We're all familiar with the mass fandom of sci-fi shows like Star Trek. Even if you've never seen it, you've undoubtedly seen the cult fandom of the show who embrace the source material almost like a life style with some going as far as to learn an entire language based around the show. It's the knowledge of this fandom that makes Galaxy Quest so enjoyable. It combines its parody of typical sci-fi clichés, with a deconstruction of the fandoms that such shows have inspired. The film starts off at a convention for a TV show that's very similar to a show like Star Trek. Just like any comic con the place is packed with people dressed up as typical Sci-Fi characters and flocking for the chance to meet their favourite characters from the show. This includes Alexander Dane (Alan Rickman) a Shakespearean style actor, who's fed up with being known as the Spock type alien from the show and wants to take on more serious roles. Gwen DeMarco (Sigourney Weaver) who played the blonde airhead character who had no real role on the show other than to look pretty. And the only actor to thrive in the fandom, Jason Nesmith (Tim Allen) the ex lead of the show who gets all the attention at the cons and approaches his popularity with a typically cocky attitude. Whilst at the convention they encounter a group of oddballs who turn out to be an alien race called the Thermians, a species of squid like creatures who use a special device that gives them a human form. They received broadcasts of the show in space but have mistaken the episodes as ""historical documents"" and believe that these actors really are the characters that they were on the show and worship them as heroes. Thus they recruit the actors to defend them in a battle against a terrifying reptilian species. There are many jokes in the films where it's important to have some familiarity with sci-fi shows like Star Trek. For example one of the best running gags in the film involves Rockwell's character fearing for his life on every dangerous mission he goes on since nobody knows his name and fears that he's an expendable character. And there's even more gags that only a person with serious familiarity with the show would be able to get. But what makes this film so great is that you could enjoy this film even if you had no familiarity with any of the things that they were referencing. It's characters are still fun, memorable and exist in their own right. Plus the costumes and effects are so great that it's even led to a small fandom somewhat similar to the likes of which the film was paying homage to that can be enjoyed by both fans of the genre and newcomers to it.","AUG 6, 2015",7.0,comedy

The Princess Bride,"The Princess Bride was originally a book written by William Goldman in 1973 and he turned it into a screenplay 10 years later. The movie, like the book is a classical story of true love, overcoming all the odds to find happiness, and it also happens to be one of the rare cases where the movie is as good as the book. One of the things that makes this movie so great is the unique way that the story is told. All too often when a book is created into a movie it is just a retelling of the book without its own twist on the story or way to make it more than a retelling, and more often than not if a movie adds its own twist it completely ruins the story. The Princess Bride is an exception to that rule, the whole premise for the movie is a sick young boy, played by Fred Savage, and his grandfather, played by Peter Falk, gives him The Princess Bride for a present and starts to read it to him. This inventive way to tell the story allowed the writers to go from scenes from the book back to the grandson’s bedroom, adding humor and creating suspense. This combined with the fact that because the writer of the screenplay and the book was the same person, which helped keep the movie’s storyline very close to the book’s storyline, makes this movie better than any other movie I’ve seen that was based on a book. Another thing that makes it such a good movie is it’s diversity in it’s themes. It’s largest theme that encompasses the whole is that true love conquers all. Now that is a theme that, although may not always be true in real life, we all love because it makes us feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Another theme that it has is that the evil people in the world get what they deserve. This is another very watchable theme, who doesn’t like seeing the good guys win? The two very inspiring and heart-warming themes can make the audience get emotionally involved with the character in the movie. I found myself rooting for character and hoping that others died. The final thing that makes this movie so incredible is the way they build the characters. The characters in the movie are not just cookie cutter characters. They all have a good and a bad side that is built up throughout the movie by their interaction with other characters. Even the hero of the story has a bad side, he cheats to win a battle of wits. The dynamics of the characters really add to the story. Overall, The Princess Bride is an incredibly well done movie with great actors to play dynamic characters, touching themes, and a very unique way to tell the story. It is a must see for all of those who haven’t seen it and a movie you will want to watch again. If you don’t believe me or if you think it will be boring I leave you this quote from the movie. “Are you kidding? Its got fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love, miracles.”","JUL 5, 2014",10.0,comedy

Everybody is also divided based on ""status"" and rarely get to actually talk to people from other ""cliques"", as is shown here. That is what makes this film so special, as it breaks down those walls and allows everyone from every different clique to really see the others as they truly are: people just like them. However, what I really liked about the film is one of the discussions they have at the end, where they discuss how their friendships will be once detention ends. This discussion really rings true as I think everybody knows that these kids will never see one another afterwards and, if they do, they may ignore them or mock them after seeing them because of high school social pressures. While this one is a very accurate representation of high school and all of its oddities, it is also very funny. At many times, I found myself laughing quite hard at something somebody said or did. Overall, this is a very good film and I feel ashamed for just watching it now.","JUN 2, 2014",8.0,comedy

Secrets & Lies,"I can point out ten moments easily where the film hands over all the responsibilities to the actors, it's a breathtaking performance. Secrets And Lies Leigh is a family man. He understands the banal relations or relatives we've all got. And he, the writer and director, Mike Leigh knows how to play a friendly chess with them. The primary reason I find his drama confident enough to run on only one piece of information is because he doesn't feel the need to give reasons for their behaviour. They are and will always be simpleton for that very note. Call it kryptonite or sensitivity, the hands starts to shake, voice breaks and, emotions on the surface. Leigh walks on his signature structure in script, i.e. to gather all the energy and motifs of characters and meet at a rendezvous point in its last act where he frames the entire burden of the film in the screen. And that scene in here, is a dinner table conversation. The camera is set and ready and, the character definitely not. The scene leaves you with chills in your spine and exhilaration is defined all over again. I don't think I have ever been so exhausted after the voice turns silence in the film; for a brief period, you get to have a similar experience after Tom Cruise ends his mission in Christopher McQuarrie's Fallout. Also, whenever something beautiful, simply beautiful comes by, that leaves me happy and satisfied. It always reminds me of Sam Mendes's American Beauty where the character is capturing varied snippets of nature. And I never thought it could be topped off by something so natural and warm. And then comes this montage of people getting their picture taken. Leigh, I think says a lot with those than he could ever with the film. This is exceptional filmmaking even for Mike Leigh, it is a whole new level. He is so rigid and strong on his views that as a viewer you are told to bend your opinions and Secrets And Lies.","JUN 21, 2019",9.0,comedy
Manhattan,"Allen's best film. Among the standouts of American cinema in the post-studio era. Virtually perfect. The film's lifted to extraordinary heights by, among other things, a brilliant screenplay, careful direction, spectacular cinematography, and amazing performances from (particularly) Allen, Keaton, and Hemingway. There's more beneath the (glittering) surface of ""Manhattan"" than any Allen film. At the center of it all is a captivating tension between romantic ideals -- the drive to satisfy them, and the hypocritical demand that others do the same -- and something of far less starry-eyed allure -- reality. This tension is achieved in multiple, varied ways within the film. From the disconnect between the impeccable look of the film and the messes played out by the characters on screen, to the contrast between one character's surprisingly precocious authenticity and the world of disingenuous posturing that infects the remaining characters. The question at the end of ""Manhattan,"" when revelation may find reality triumphing over romanticism, and taking on a more enduring, humane, and compassionate value of its own, is whether enlightenment (if that's what is) has come too late.","MAY 6, 2012",10.0,comedy

3 Idiots,"3 Idiots is a rather great Bollywood movie, truly hilarious and yet with a very focused and introspective message on life and the choices we make. From a screenwriting perspective, it's almost the perfect script. It has a large number of different characters that all stand out and manage to be interesting in their own way, with a number of themes weaved throughout the film that makes it a very well put together piece. The actors also all do a very good job, and the songs are memorable, better than most Bollywood movies. Most of all, the movie has an infectious youthful spirit that is very hard not to like. A refreshing, at times moving and very funny, blast of summer air. But, here's the thing. And this is more a reflection on society than a fault of the movie, yet it is remarkable to observe how unaware the characters are that the very message of the story, about freedom and making your own choices, is undermined in every way by the way the film ends. Because at the end, after all that talk about not caring about social status and money and living your life **** of the characters are singing and dancing and crying tears of joy because A) they got high-paying jobs or B) they are getting married and fulfilling they social contract. That is how society works, all over the world. All people deep down understand that life is not meant to be slaved away working for money or titles. Everyone wants to ""change the system"" or ""be different."" But at the end of the day, the vast majority of people are too afraid to reach out for true freedom. True freedom, either by individuals leaving the system or working to abolish the system, does not have a happy ending. Freedom is not free. The price for freedom is in blood, and often in isolation. For most, the true price of freedom is too high. And so, like all the characters in this movie, they create a ""false freedom"" in order to fill that gaping hole in their hearts. They make fun of the character who is greedy and openly lives for his love of money, thinking they are different but at the end they submit to the chains of marriage, to the chains of working for a corporate company. The main character, who most boasts about this ""freedom"" is a perfect example of this. He encourages others to choose the majors they are interested in studying, to do what they want with their lives but it just so happens that, conveniently, his own choice in the engineering field will make him a very rich man. It is easy for rich people to tell the poor that money is not important, it is a whole other thing to live that life. So all of that together, 3 Idiots is a delightful movie about characters creating false freedoms and finding joy in them, which is a lie the majority of mankind tells itself each and every day when it wakes up in the morning. Is there no hope left for true freedom? Are there no more warriors left to fight the good fight? Or must we all get married and get corporate jobs? Is a happy lie better than the harsh truth?

S1m0ne,"Simone is a hilarious, inventive satire on the inner workings of Hollywood. Al Pacino gives one of his most refined roles as an aging director who's movies have lost their popularity. One day he meets a fan who is about to pass away in a week due to inoperable brain cancer. Al Pacino receives a package a week later. The package is a computer disc. The disc gives him the ability to create a digital actress ! Once he creates Simone which means simulation one in the movie hinting that she is imaginary not a real person, he is set. His movies regain their momentum, he reconnects with his daughter and wife and everything seems perfect.However when something feels too good to be true or everlasting it usually is. His creation backfires and he is almost arrested for the murder of Simone. He attempts to dispose of the disc by dumping a trunk into an ocean. The disc is the only evidence Simone exists and that he isn't a murderer. When the police retrieve the trunk it is empty. In the end Victor Taransky is let off of the charges because Victor's daughter is computer savvy. She discovers that the Simone program isn't erased on his computer and she restores the program. Then she has Simone release a public video statement that she is alive and that Victor is innocent. There are also a few cameos in the movie by Jay Mohr, Winona Ryder and Rebecca Stamos from X-Men (Mystique character).

Manhattan,"Beautiful and witty, Manhattan is a wonderful work of cinema. Then again, I am a big fan of Woody Allen himself, but that aside the choice of black and white photography helps compliment and boost the film itself. While Annie Hall maybe be slightly more humorous, Manhattan is more serious in its prose and provides a nice balance between the comic and the dramatic. What I find simply wonderful about this film and many others of Allen's is their ability to read like books, with great characters that are deep and realistic rather than stiff and clichÃ. This movie is just simply a masterpiece.","DEC 31, 2011",10.0,comedy
Cherry,"Cherry is a surprising film in that its budget is awful, its filmed hastily but all of that doesn't detract from the fact the film itself, the writing, the acting and the overall feel of the film, is fantastic. Cherry tells the story of a 17 year old boy Aaron (Kyle Gallner) who goes to an Ivy League college on an engineering scholarship despite the fact he loves to draw. In a sketch class he meets Linda (Laura Allen), an older woman who offers to cook him dinner. He goes back to hers and meets her daughter Beth (Britt Robertson) a troubled but clever 14 year old girl. Aaron begins to learn different things from both of them while also becoming a part of their family. Sure the film offers up some cliches (the inappropriate roommate) but it more than makes up for it in heart with a great ending offering up a kind of hope for a family that started out so frayed and a boy that was not yet a man.","OCT 20, 2011",8.0,comedy

Stranger Than Fiction,"An at times funny, but thoroughly sincere and authentic film. Starring Will Ferrell in a career-best performance, Stranger Than Fiction also features good performances from a stellar cast that includes Maggie Gyllenhaal, Dustin Hoffman, Emma Thompson, and Queen Latifah. Together, they help to bring to life a unique premise with a very non-unique core that explores the age old question, ""What would you do if you knew you were about to die?"" A very unique execution of this simple question, Stranger Than Fiction is an incredibly heartfelt film with a very human center that explores humanity and our greatest fear; death. With smart writing and good direction, Stranger Than Fiction quirkiness never gets out of hand and instead delivers on being a smart film that takes its characters seriously and though there is a certain lightness to the film, it can be incredibly dark as it explores death, fear, and the boundaries of our own world. Overall, Stranger Than Fiction is a clever film that showcases Will Ferrell's acting talent.","MAY 22, 2016",8.0,comedy

The soundtrack is great which doesn't even need to be said of a Crowe film. John Cusask plays a unique, but likeable and memorable character in Lloyd Dobler and then Ione Skye gives what is likely the best performance of her career. Say Anything is simply a classic and belongs up there with the rom com classics.","JAN 3, 2016",8.0,comedy

Mighty Aphrodite,"A modern update on Pygmalion starring a hooker with a heart of gold, Mighty Aphrodite is an absolutely hysterical film by director Woody Allen. Blending social commentary with neurosis, Mighty Aphrodite is a play on the Greek tragedies and amended for Allen's style and wit. The end result is a film that references various Greek tragedies throughout and manages to subvert the expectations of its genre, in spite of repeated warnings from the chorus. Inventive, imaginative, quirky, and witty, Mighty Aphrodite is a film that is decidedly Woody Allen, but feels risky and far more adventurous than many of his other more modern films. With a classic turn from the oddball filmmaker and from Mira Sorvino, Mighty Aphrodite is an incredibly charming film. The best part of this film is undoubtedly the chorus. Led by F. Murray Abraham, the chorus is a source of great comedy from interactions with Lenny Weinrib (Woody Allen) to calling Zeus and getting his answering machine, the chorus is hysterical. However, as with all Greek tragedies, they play a key role. They tell of events off-screen, alert us to issues the characters face, and intervene throughout. F. Murray Abraham pops up throughout the film to urge Lenny to not be an idiot or give him advice on how to handle a situation. But, above all, the chorus is there is warn characters about obsession and the path to avoid tragedy. They are incredibly doom and gloom and constantly expect the worst to come around every corner. However, Allen's film subverts this with a largely happy and sound landing. Things work out the way they are should with no miscommunication or other romantic comedy cliches. Instead, Allen takes the depressing endings of Greek tragedies and plays it more along the lines of a rom-com where everybody ends up satisfied. This feels like subversion, if only because of the chorus and Allen's repeated references to Greek plays. One of the most prominent plays referenced in the film is Oedipus. With Jocasta (Olympia Dukakis) and Laius (David Ogden Stiers) in the film, Allen makes overt references, but also adds in Kevin (Michael Rapaport). On a date with with porn star and prostitute Linda Ash (Mira Sorvino), Kevin makes repeated references to how he wants a girl like his mother who takes care of the home and makes dinner, etc. Clearly Oedipal, this date is a precursor to the poor guy finding out Linda made porn films. Needless to say, he did not take kindly. The references continue with a fortune teller named Cassandra (Danielle Ferland) who nobody takes seriously as she warns Lenny about tracking down Linda, the mother of his adopted son, and - along with the chorus - warns him about the trap of obsession. Lenny ignores these warnings and goes behind his wife Amanda's (Helena Bonham Carter) back to find Linda to satisfy his own curiosity (the real killer of people, not that **** about the ozone layer"", as the chorus warns) regarding his brilliant son's roots. The film also introduces Tiresias (Jack Warden), the blind prophet. Warning Lenny as to his wife's potential unfaithfulness, Tiresias sees all and remarks that one would ""have to be blind"" to not see Amanda's positive response to her potential lover. Oh the dramatic irony. Allen treks on with an ending fit for a Greek tragedy, even if it is not tragic and more in line with a romantic comedy. With Lenny having Linda's son and Linda giving birth to a daughter fathered by Lenny, the two meet again once more a few years after the events of the film. However, they both keep the lineage of their children a secret. They are pleased to see one another with both of them happily married to other people. A classic case of dramatic irony with the audience knowing the truth, but both characters ignorant of the truth, the film's ending is honestly perfect. That said, the film does have some faults. After a hot start with a fast and light opening 20 minutes that leaves you in stitches, the next 40-50 minutes are a bit slower. The humor is more subtle as Allen dives into the plot with Linda. Jokes come, but not like the first 20 minutes, which was constant. Instead, some jokes fall a bit flatter or result in simple chuckles. This section is what separates it from Allen's best works, as the final half hour or so is terrific yet again. However, the second act just slacks a bit and fails to live up to great first and third acts of this film. However, Mighty Aphrodite is still an incredibly funny film that is easy entertainment. With a neurotic and nervy turn from Woody Allen and a great bombastic performance from Mira Sorvino, the film is fun and light entertainment. Allen's films manages to always be a breeze to watch, but always truly mentally engaging at the same time with some philosophical thoughts. But, he instead dumps the philosophy here and goes to the source: Greek tragedies. Allen has a thing for the mind of the Greeks and that becomes all the more clear in this film.","JAN 26, 2017",8.0,comedy

Dave Chappelle's Block Party,"Liking this movie will likely involve, in order: a) being a fan of Talib Kweli, Mos Def, Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, etc. b) being a Dave Chapelle fan c) knowing that this is a concert documentary, not a comedy show. I watched it meeting each of those criteria, and I enjoyed it. The film really captured the spontaneity of Dave making the event happen. Dave seemed to try to invite anyone and everyone that might be involved in his life to any degree, regardless of whether or not they already like hip-hop/neo soul music. On stage, Dave was mostly just hosting the musical guests, and there wasn't any formal stand-up act. You get to see the artists backstage with Dave in a more candid, personal light, and the film takes on his personality. My favorite parts are when Dave is rehearsing with the Roots band/Mos Def for a little routine for the concert. It's not a perfectly crafted documentary, but overall, it's just a fun time with ordinary people, allowing you to see many of the performers as regular people as well. If none of this interests you, then don't bother watching.","NOV 24, 2010",8.0,comedy

Galaxy Quest,"`Galaxy Quest': Fighting Bad Aliens, for Real. Whether you love ""Star Trek"" or laugh at it, your starship is about to come in, docking in the form of ""Galaxy Quest,"" an amiable comedy that simultaneously manages to spoof these popular futuristic space adventures and replicate the very elements that have made them so durable. ""Galaxy Quest,"" opening Saturday, spins out of a single joke, about a bunch of washed-up actors from a canceled television series who are enlisted by some credulous interplanetary simpletons to champion them in conflict with a scaly, bellicose villain who has all but exterminated their people. If ""Galaxy Quest"" never attains consistently giddy heights as it plays out its combination of knowing satire and heroic adventure, it nevertheless keeps its tongue firmly in its cheek, offers a few genuine laughs, moves swiftly, if not at warp speed, and is led by a talented cast. The crew includes Tim Allen as the egotistical Jason Nesmith. To his legions of fans, he is Cmdr. Peter Quincy Taggart, of the immortal line ""Never give up; never surrender."" Sigourney Weaver, no stranger to combat with slimy space aliens, plays Gwen DeMarco, known to her fans as Lt. Tawny Madison, the voluptuous communications officer aboard Taggart's ship, Protector. And Alan Rickman is Alexander Dane, who sadly remembers that he once portrayed Richard III in the days before he signed on to become the Spock-like humanoid Dr. Lazarus. These actors and Tony Shalhoub as Fred Kwan, alias Tech Sgt. Chen, and Daryl Mitchell as Tommy Webber, the navigator Lt. Laredo, have been reduced to signing autographs at fan shows for $15 a pop and snipping ribbons at supermarket openings when fate (directed by Dean Parisot from a script by David Howard and Robert Gordon) intervenes. In a scene that skewers the ubiquitous ""Star Trek"" fan conventions, as the testy, disheartened crew copes with costumed cultists, minutiae-obsessed teen-agers and giggling groupies, Nesmith-Taggart is approached by a group of odd creatures he assumes are fans. He dismisses their monotonous babble. The next day, after he wakes up on the floor at home, hung over after a night of solitary drinking, they whisk him off to what he thinks is another re-enactment: a negotiation as Taggart with the evil Sarris (Robin Sachs) on behalf of the gentle Thermians. But when Nesmith-Taggart is miraculously returned, he realizes that he has been aboard a genuine spaceship. It seems that the Thermians, led by Mathesar (Enrico Colantoni), believe the courage- and principle-filled ""Galaxy Quest"" television episodes they have witnessed to be actual historical documents and have sought out Taggart to lead them. ""Alexander,"" Taggart tells the once and future Dr. Lazarus after he rises to the challenge and enlists his old crew, ""this is the role of a lifetime."" So off they go, joined -- in one of the film's best comic conceptions -- by Guy Fleegman (Sam Rockwell), now a convention organizer but once an obscure bit player who died a quick death in episode 81. Throughout the adventure, as the heroes do battle with Sarris and his minions, encounter cannibalistic space creatures who resemble children, face off against assorted monsters and other perils while standing between the Thermians and extinction, Fleegman remains convinced that being an unknown actor, he is fated by the laws of scriptwriting to perish once more. In the parched comic landscape that now stretches over much of planet Earth, ""Galaxy Quest"" may not be a monument to the genre, but it offers a ray of hope for the future.","APR 3, 2016",7.0,comedy

Early on you are given very clear cut rules for time travel, but more than halfway through the film those rules are inexplicably tossed aside.

The Royal Tenenbaums,"As an unfortunate soul who was yet to see The Grand Budapest Hotel, I can safely say that The Royal Tenenbaums is my favorite of Wes Anderson's films. The bleak humour blended with the wonderful performances from an incredible cast bring to life a family struggling to figure out their purpose in the world. Watching them reconcile with one another is really special, and Wes Anderson's style is perfect for this story. This is a movie with a lot of heart that is an extremely enjoyable watch despite its dark themes.","JAN 23, 2022",9.0,comedy
Hot Rod,"Hot Rod is an underrated gem of a movie. The movie's got a really good story and it's about this lad, who's called Rod (Andy Samberg) who's this slacker. He lives with his mother, his brother and his stepfather (Ian Mcshane). However, later in the movie, we find out that Rod's stepfather needs an operation. So, Rod and his crew decide to raise some funds for it and he plans to set a school bus jumping record to earn the money for his stepfather. The movie's got some great acting from all of the cast, especially from Rod, Dave and Frank those three are all honestly brilliant. The movie's got some very funny dialogue, which is given well from the characters throughout this movie. Also, the humour which this movie's got is honestly brilliant, most of the scenes throughout this movie had me dying of laughter, especially the ones with Rod doing the stunts. The pacing for the build ups throughout this movie is very hit and miss, most of the time it works very well and the scenes are very well built up. While, some of the scenes aren't and it sort of ruins those specific scenes being built up. There's surprisingly a good amount of heart throughout this movie, which I wasn't expecting and that's another positive for this movie. Finally, there's some really good love and hate chemistry between Rod and his stepfather throughout this movie and it's really well built up. The love interest between Rod and Denise (Isha Fisher) is decent and it works quite well throughout this movie. The movie's even got a great soundtrack with lots of great songs from Europe and many more. Overall, Hot Rod is an underrated gem of a movie. The movie's got a really good story, great acting, funny dialogue, brilliant humour, hit and miss pacing and a good amount of heart. The movie's even got a really good love and hate relationship between the son and the stepfather, a decent love interest and a great soundtrack.","DEC 10, 2020",7.0,comedy
Mousehunt,"Mouse Hunt is very silly, and quite funny, at the same time completely unrealistic (and kinda stupid). The highlight of this film is definetely its comedic moments and things that happen, the actual dialogue isn't very funny, but then again, I don't think it's supposed to be. The character building is surprisingly great in this film, as they change throughout the film, you start to feel for them, well, not really, more like you start to laugh at them, because they're so stupid and are rubbish at trying to catch the mouse. However, the comedy and character building are the only great things about it, the story's pretty good and kinda moving, the actings good, and everything else about this film is nothing better or worse than mediocre. Mouse Hunt is a typically comedicly silly and charmingly simple family film, and does a good job at what it aims to do entertain it's audience. So I give this film a... 73/100!","JUL 31, 2013",7.0,comedy

Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,"Words cannot describe how wonderful this film was. The story is admittedly daft, but the film itself is witty, sophisticated and hysterically stupid, while being fast, furious and fun as well. The humour is hilarious to the point of sides splitting, from the mocking of the fashion and musical style of the Swinging Sixties period, to countless references to 007, Matt Helm and Our Man Flint. And Austin's catchphrases?... groovy! The film looks amazing, with bright colourful sets and great costumes, and the soundtrack is funky. Then we have Mike Myers brilliant as Austin Powers(better than he was in Cat in the Hat anyway, the less said about that travesty the better), and hysterically over-the-top as the arch-nemesis Dr Evil, and Elizabeth Hurley fabulously sexy as Vanessa Kensington. Overall, wonderful film, better than I thought it would be. Shagadelic, baby! 9/10 Bethany Cox","MAR 27, 2022",9.0,comedy

Chasing Amy,"Chasing Amy is an incredibly funny, touching, and personal, film that, with the backdrop of potty humor, crafts a brilliantly mature and authentic relationship. Ben Affleck and Joey Lauren Adams are both fantastic here and really capture the true essence of their characters and have great chemistry with one another. The writing and direction from Kevin Smith are both great, as is his cameo as Silent Bob with Jason Mewes as Jay. Both are hysterical here and use their brief appearance to its max potential. However, what holds this film back from being truly great is the ending. I appreciate the end result, but how it gets there is idiotic and nearly gave me a headache it was so truly dumb. This ultimately sullies the end product. Fortunately, the film is greatly entertaining and hysterical throughout so it is able to overcome this shortcoming.

This film opens the door of the aspiring acting world of what it takes to make it in the movie industry.

There are so many randomly hilarious moments that come out of nowhere, that make me laugh just thinking about it. Some may say it's a one joke movie, but you couldn't be anymore wrong about this movie. It's as entertaining as they come, and is only 1 hour and 20 minutes as it is, so it isn't overly indulgent like some comedies are. It's a quick, fun, hilarious ride, and is completely original.

The Breakfast Club,"While I slightly prefer Planes, Trains and Automobiles, this along with Ferris Bueller's Day Off is one of John Hughes' better films. It isn't a perfect film I agree as admittedly the characters are clichéd and there are minor logic lapses, but here's the thing- the more I see The Breakfast Club the more I like it. It still has its freshness, and while I never had a detention when I was in school even from what I've heard from people who have this actually makes detentions cool. And it is still relevant not only to the teenagers back then but now too, it does ring true a vast majority of the time what with its justified grievances, self-pitying whinges and hard-hitting home truths. The cinematography is nice and fluid, typical Hughes really, and the soundtrack adds to the film's coolness. Hughes directs wonderfully, and the script and story are well written and I think memorable. While their characters are clichéd, that I agree, the cast do a great job with what they have. Emilio Estevez, Judd Nelson, Ally Sheedy, Anthony Michael Hall and especially Molly Ringwald give very appealing performances and interact well together. In conclusion, I love this film, while not perfect I like it more every time I see it. 10/10 Bethany Cox","MAR 27, 2022",10.0,comedy

Hard to say. Probably most appealing to teenagers. I don't know. I had a good time, and like I said, it went by fast, so it's a good movie. It's just the characters that pull it off. Everyone was a little different. Maybe that made it that much more interesting.

Stranger Than Fiction,"First of all, the story is so smart, clever, complex, but all the while completely simple. The execution of it makes the difference, director Marc Forster did a perfect job with this one. It's different, touching, funny, and most important...thought-provoking! It really makes you think about life. The cast is my absolute favorite thing about the film. I do not like Will Ferrell at all, nor do I like his movies. He's too over the top and rarely funny in my opinion, but here, he acts. He genuinely tries to portray a character, and he succeeds. He really gives a good performance, and to this day, this is the only film of his that I like and will confidently recommend to anyone. Emma Thompson gives a truly remarkable performance as the suicidal author, Karen Eiffel; her performance is so good that I think she deserved an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, but that's just me. I laughed at her, felt for her, and was even weirded out by her quirkiness. It's a well-rounded and highly memorable performance for me. Then there's the famous Dustin Hoffman who was excellently cast, and Maggie Gyllenhaal, who plays one of my all-time favorite movie characters, Miss Pascal, a free spirited Baker who becomes the love interest in the film. It's hard to describe her really, but Gyllenhaal is PERFECT! A stunning performance that I will never forget. Also the small roles of Queen Latifah, Tom Hulce, and Linda Hunt are so nice. The screenplay is another one of my favorite things about the film; the writing and script of this film is smart, fresh, and brilliant. There are many memorable and quotable dialogue scenes. Add to that a brilliant cast and a good director....everything falls perfectly into place. Also the locations used in the film are perfect! It gives the film an indie feel that I absolutely love. Stranger Than Fiction: a great, near perfect comedy film! Completely underrated, in my opinion. I recommend it!","JUN 1, 2013",9.0,comedy

Charlie's Angels,"Charlie's Angels: 8 out of 10: Reading the major press reviews I am struck by a time travel quality of their pans. It is as if they are watching another movie entirely. It's as if they were watching the leaden Charlie's Angels sequel Full Throttle. The first Angels however is a great movie if you keep three things in mind. It is mindless. It is fun. It is mindless fun. Never has eye candy had so many empty calories. As nutritious for your brain as a deep-fried Twinkie and with about as much substance, Charlie's Angels is about as quintessential a summer movie as you can get. This is not a bad thing. With a great soundtrack, three hot girls, solid supporting cast and non-stop action even brainless fun can be… well good. It is not easy to make a film this shallow, this entertaining. (As the sequel proved and come to think of it dozens of movies prove every summer.) In reality there is a fine line between fluffy, bubble headed, featherbrained fun and feeble-minded, half-witted, imbecilic drudgery. Charlie's Angels stays solidly on the featherbrained, fluffy side. It is that rather rare film that is smart enough to keep it simple and needless to say mindlessly fun.","JUL 12, 2014",8.0,comedy

Suddenly realising he is about to die Crick goes in search of the author in hope of changing her mind about killing him off. Will Ferrell gives a subdued but humorous performance in the lead role; his reaction to hearing the narration for the first time is priceless. The movie itself is both heart-warming and intelligent as we see Crick going about his life in awkward fashion and the scenes with potential love interest Ana are a joy to watch.

Bottle Rocket,"This movie I believe was written while Owen (and Luke(?)) and Wes were at university together in Texas in the 1990s and is now seen as a cult comedy hit. Bottle Rocket is all about three friends who team up to escape their boring lifes and pursuit a life of petty crime. This eventually leads to the local criminal 'head honcho' who's played by James Caan, spotting them and convincing them to carry out a large heist - but is it too much for them to handle and will they get away with it? The movie starts with Anthony (played by Luke Wilson) getting out out of a psychiatric ward (which he stayed at due to suffering exhaustion), with his friend Dignans help (played by Owen Wilson), even though he could voluntarily leave, Dignan was keen to try and help him 'escape' so Anthony let him and after they leave, Dignan proudly explains to Anthony his 75 year plan, which documents exactly how their going to live this life of petty crime and get by. Of course there is alot of naivety there and things don't really work out as planned but its Dignans character that you really feel most intrigued by and interested in, in general (maybe im baised as a fan of Owens but I still feel that way). He tries so hard to believe that he has everything planned out and knows how to lead this semi fantastic life that will keep him and his friends going by ok and he clearly craves the responsibility of being the boss, where Anthony on the other hand is alot more dubious and unsure and tries to plan things more practically. Where Dignan is always the over optimist, Anthony is more the worrier but its in Dignans child like optimism and hope that he clearly has alot of belief in, that really makes the viewer feel for him. You worry that it won't be possible for him to carry out his plans and for everything to go just as planned in his 75 year plan and so the movie follows the three friends as they embark on the first stages of this plan... of course, as feared, not everything does go to plan but still Dignan comes across as the ever optimist, who tries to convince Anthony that they can overcome their problems and the three of them travel, staying at a motel for some time where Anthony falls for one of the motels maid, Ines, that happens to only properly speak Spanish, which is a problem considering that Anthony doesn't speak Spanish, so he gets a fellow motel employee to translate for him. This ends up causing problems where Dignan mistakenly gets the wrong message, put it that way! There are definately some funny moments, again its pretty subtle comedy, as in all of Wes Andersons movies but it does definately have its moments. I thought the movie was in some ways pretty sentimental and idealistic I suppose you could say and I think if people had the faith in pursuing the life they want and believing in themselves like Dignan tries so hard to do in this movie, it would be a good thing. The characters in the movie are all fairly complicated and quirky and in a sense I suppose, thinking more negatively, you may feel as if it never really entirely 'gets off the ground', story wise but if you think about it afterwards, I think it works well enough. Its similar to Wes' other films with subtle messages and this particular film I thought was also quite sentimental and kind hearted, in a sense I suppose it has links to the great ol' American dream that they talk about (the general 'they') and the pursuit of some great life... of course you'll have to buy the movie to see if they manage to succeed with their planned life of petty crime and see what happens when their pushed into the heist... surely this is too much for them? I quite enjoyed this movie, although it did get a bit slow in parts, I thought that the dialogue was particularly well thought out, with Dignan and Anthony having some pretty good quotes and of course the acting was good, this movie was a good starting place for the Wilson brothers, Bob Musgrave and as Wes' first film. Considering it didn't have a massive budget and it does have a slightly more independent film feel about it, which I think in a way adds to its charm, it works well. Again don't go in expecting lots of slapstick humour, think of it as a sort of a chronicle of a what happens to a small group of friends and one dreamer who believes he knows how to get through life in a slightly more unconventional way than normal... this is somewhat similar to other Wes movies with more sentimentality in it I feel and I do believe it is worth watching.","NOV 24, 2021",7.0,comedy

It's charming, lovely, smart, and heart-warming. Emma Stone shined like a diamond in this film, combining the best of her acting, gorgeous looks, and charming character. I could not have picked a better couple for this film than Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. Their performance together took my heart to far-away galaxies a hundred times over, and still left me hungry for more! The sheer power of a Steinway and Sons Piano and the soothing, nostalgic sounds it makes, takes this film's power of emotion to a whole other level. The filming was excellent combined with the dancing, music, and setting of each scene.

Despite initial concerns, the musical elements of the film are seamlessly integrated into the story, allowing it to develop organically.

The great musical films have you walking out of the theater with a song in your head that you just can not get out of your mind: Singin' in the Rain, White Christmas, Moulin Rouge's Come What May. None of the songs in La La Land leave any kind of lasting impression. And though Stone and Gosling have good screen presence, it's hard to imagine that there weren't better dancers/singers on offer in LA's sprawling theater scene. Several of the dance scenes and songs seem limited by their talents, and the movie's core message about ambition and creativity would have been much more powerful if the film featured true no-names rather than a highly successful actor and actress.","SEP 29, 2017",5.0,comedy

Nothing wrong with the instrumental music its the songs that i dislike, which is a shame as visually it was stunning throwback towards the golden age of hollywood musicals. The songs emma and ryan are forced into trying to sing are demanding stuff that a skilled singer could really make something out of sadly that was not to be. If these actors had tried to audition for american idol neither ryan or emma would stand a chance of getting in. Yet somehow nobody cares they are lead in a hollywood musical they are still praised to high heavens for la la land its beyond me why all the critics set the bar so incredible low for hollywood actors singing.

La La Land,"La La Land is the new movie of Damien Chazelle, and after Whiplash the expectations are high, although is a musical, so obviously contains flash mobs, everybody singing at the stupidest situation and knowing perfectly the choreography. Despite that, like I said before, the director in his previous work demonstrated all his potential, the problem is that in this film there is none of that. The complex protagonist that wants to reach a goal, making a path marked by obsession, that implies rupture of own canons and lot of sacrifice to finally find itself again in perfection, is lost. Here the protagonists are nothing but stereotypes, they are empty, circular, and there is no evolution at all. Also we have zero development of secondary roles, simple plot and predictable conflict. The outcome did surprise me, totally unexpected, but cannot save this mediocre picture. The songs are great and enjoyable, nothing to say about them, the performances are fine too, up to the occasion. This film is made in order that the viewer leaves the theater feeling well, but really is a setup to deceive the weak-minded.","JAN 21, 2017",4.0,comedy

Snipey and dark, with low chemistry. After suffering thru the beginning, I was a little enthused by the 'pool party' scene, which was finally light, both visually and in mood. But then, it retreated into its marginally directed dirge-y-ness. The wildly over-worked planetarium romance scene looked hokey in this age of great effects... and we are led to believe that two gorgeous adults living in LA are ruminating about a kiss in a way some grade-schoolers might? In fact, that makes me realize, if this film was made based on junior-high students, it may've made a lot more sense.","MAY 17, 2017",4.0,comedy

It's supposed to be L.A. but it feels more like some unmapped area of whitetown. Wish they would have cast someone other than emma stone. Her acting wasn't solid, singing was mediocre at best and the whole time all i could wonder is when was the last time she has eaten a good meal because her rail thin body distracted me the entire time. I felt like if a big gust of win came along she would get blown off set! All in all the movie is watchable but it's not going to blow you away like the wind might do to Ms. Stone.

La La Land,"I liked this movie and knew my mother would love it. She and my sister then saw it and mom did indeed love it. I thought it was pretty good, by no means great. My wife hated it, which I think is a bit strong. This is a throwback to musical films of the past, the ones my mother loved and had the soundtrack albums for when I was growing up. Though it most closely resembles The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, I suspect most of the user reviewers never saw that 1964 French film, which I liked more than La La Land. There are moments in the movie when I got the feeling it was about to start getting really good then it would stall again for me. Neither of the lead actors can sing or dance particularly well, though Emma Stone is better at both than Ryan Gosling. Their acting and chemistry are great. The travelogue of Los Angeles aspect of the film is very appealing and fun. But, ultimately, this is a movie about two beautiful people whose career choices take them in different directions, which is fine, but not that interesting. It is pure escapist entertainment, which, if done right, can be excellent. The story of a mid 20s actress who is giving up and going home to live with her upper middle class parents and the white guy who is going to save traditional jazz music from the likes of John Legend is not that appealing to me. I get why most people really like this movie. I really do. I knew my mom would. I'd rather rewatch The Umbrellas of Cherbourg.","FEB 9, 2017",6.0,comedy
La La Land,"La La Land is a movie that owes its relative success not to the technical quality of the film; editing, script, director, etc.; but instead people's longing for nostalgia, manipulating the audience emotionally, keeping a 'light of hope' alive until the last minute, and of course the leading actors who are loved by both opposite genders. The fact that it left tears and smiles on the audience's face at the end explains why he is so identified with the audience. However, if there is one thing to remember, it is the difference between successful and quality film. In addition, success is subjective, quality (technical) objective data; It would be more rational to compare from this point of view. Whether la la land is a ""dreamland"" as depicted in the movie, or just a fake paradise, the decision is yours. I only respect the ones which touches my brain, not necessarily or only my heart.","NOV 18, 2022",4.0,comedy

La La Land,"Having waited a year since its original release before I finally saw it meant that I could watch it without the typical Oscars hype that surrounded it. And frankly, I just don't get what the hype was all about. The story is a somewhat muddled tale of a struggling actress and a jazz musician who fall in love, though they struggle to keep things together as they chase their dreams. Now, a plain story like this can usually be dressed up in a musical with flashy singing and dancing - neither of which are present here. The songs are repetitive, as it turns out that listening to the exact same chord progression repeated for two hours can become a bit tedious; and Stone and Gosling's ""singing-in-the-shower"" warbles certainly didn't dazzle this viewer. In fact, their restrained musical performances are an embarassment to the resplendant costumes and sets that surround them. What's worst, however, is that its potential did shine through. There are two or three dramatic scenes between Stone and Gosling that are so well written and brilliantly acted, they genuinely show up the mediocrity of the rest. It's not a bad film, by any standards, just very painfully and shamefully average. Finally, I watch enough Strictly Come Dancing to be irked by the poor shaping of Emma Stone's hands during her final musical number with Ryan Gosling. But that's being quite picky, isn't it?","NOV 14, 2017",5.0,comedy

The cast is not not amazing but it does the job and I kinda feel sorry for Ryan Gosling - he is way better than this, but apparently for some mysterious reasons his career is going downhill. I'm sorry, but if this get's best motion picture of year, then academy awards can go to hell, since those are going garbage more and more every year. It's not a bad movie, but it's not great either.

La La Land,"My wife and I purchased this film on one of the streaming services and settled in for a pleasant evening of light entertainment on a big screen tv with sound coming from a couple of thousand dollars worth of audio equipment, but it turns out we were all dressed up with no place to go. That is, this multi-Oscar winner turned out to be a loser that let us down on every front. For those who haven't seen it I won't spoil the story by saying that it appears to be an updated tribute to the old musical romantic comedies. Instead of placing the young boy-girl couple back in time, we see them cavorting on the crowded interstates of modern Los Angeles which feature countless Prius Hybrids rather than elegant RR Silver Clouds. The effect is mildly humorous but not romantic. The lack of musical talent in the two leads is neither funny nor romantic. We were reminded of the fact that long ago most entertainers could sing and dance decently if not wonderfully but today's stars are not that versatile. And it's pretty depressing watching the talent lumber across a screen that the old movie-makers would have killed to use for their productions. We live in a time of technical marvels. This movie made poor use of them. Take the matter of color, for example. The look of the old Hollywood musicals was determined in part by the lack of subtlety of the color film available at the time. Knowing the limitations of the medium the old filmmakers used sets that made a kind of fantastic beauty. Everything looked perfect, though unreal. The control that filmmakers have over color today allows for just about any imaginable look. My question is who would choose to dress the characters as if they were in an old Hollywood fantasy and then photograph them against completely realistic backgrounds featuring brown palm trees, wilted flowers, and roads and buildings that remind us that our country's infrastructure is crumbling (one of the few points that people of all political stripes can agree on). Finally, I'm forced to ask WHY the audience is supposed to care about our lead couple. There's lots of talent out there working its heart out to get some good, steady work. Why should we want this particular duo to make it. They don't seem especially brilliant. When the young lady isn't selected for a part by a rather rude producer, I found myself thinking ""well, I guess he had something else in mind"". I mean, her performance didn't immediately grab me. She didn't jump out at me. And that has happened on occasion hen a great actor does a bit part in a film and you find yourself saying, my god! Who WAS that?! So all in all another mega hit about Hollywood that got great reviews from people who live in that world--I've noticed that film critics seem to give extra points to movies about making movies. I call it the Barton Fink effect. Maybe I'm getting old and have seen too many movies. But frankly I don' think that's the problem with a La La production that just seems flat and ugly.","APR 16, 2017",0.0,comedy

La La Land,"A terrible musical with horrific singing. I mean really, this musical makes GLEE sound good. I mean, dear god. Just Ugh. The main sins of this film include: 1. The obnoxious and distracting camera work. They try and look clever with all these contentious shots. The issue is that ruins the pacing of each scene since it leaves no room for properly edited cuts. 2. The music, the singing and sound mixing are all atrocious. ""Another Day of Sun"" is possibly one of the single worst opening numbers I've witnessed. And I say witnessed, not heard, because you can't hear a damn thing. The music sounds like what you'd hear in an elevator. Competent but boring. The singing is the same, but none of the few decent singers this movie has can harmonise properly. It's hard to notice that problem though, when you can't hear them over the damn music. 3. Yeah... The ""white guy trying to save Jazz"" is problematic as hell. It's like how in RENT all the white people are being gentrified out of their neighbourhood by a black guy... Like, are you freaking kidding me? It doesn't bother me that much, but it's an issue. Look, if you like this. Hey, that's great and.. No, I can't do this. Like, if you enjoyed this, I genuinely feel sorry you haven't been exposed to better musicals. I mean go look up Hairspray's opening on youtube. That's a song about Baltimore, yet it sounds more inviting than LA. Or go watch ""Singing in the Rain"". Sit down and listen to some of the musical numbers from Wicked or Hamilton or The Book of Mormon. Hell, if you're rich enough go see them while you still can. There is a world of far, far, faaaaaaaar superior musicals out there for you to enjoy. La La Land is an insult to them all.","APR 26, 2017",2.0,comedy

La La Land,"La La Land is a poor attempt to copy 1950s era musicals; i.e., it's a musical wannabe, but that genre died out sixty years ago. Neither Gosling nor Stone can sing, but they're in a musical? The plot is impossible and very weak, and after suffering the insult to our intelligence and senses for about 30 minutes, we walked out on this movie, disgusted that we just spent a half hour of our lives we'll never get back - and spent it on a horrible movie that was not the least bit entertaining, memorable or worth twenty bucks. It wouldn't even be worth the time to download a freebie copy from the internet. Our recommendation on La La Land is to SAVE YOUR MONEY!!","FEB 26, 2017",0.0,comedy
La La Land,"La La Land, not quite my tempo. In general, I do not enjoy musicals, so I kept my expectations as low as possible before viewing this one. I do not think I have ever been more bored in my life, and I have literally watched paint dry. I cared a little about Sebastian, because he was devoted in jazz, even in some weird way, but not at all about Mia, who wanted to become an actress but had not even watched ""Rebel Without a Cause"" and did not convince in any other way during the movie about her devotion in acting (e.g., saying something about her favorite scene or actress and how that made her feel, we just see her going through terrible auditions). Someway along the movie we get our scheduled love-fight, meant to temporarily separate the couple, so that the plot can move on. The way the fight escalates is laughable. At this point I realized that the script might have been written by an AI and not a human being. But, anyway, Sebastian makes it up for her, and the couple is about to reunite, but they put their relationship in a pause in order for them to pursue their dreams. That is logical. It turns out that Mia meets someone else, marries him, and has a child. That is also logical and can happen in real life. What is not logical is the fact that they have not kept in touch during all those years and act all surprised when they meet by chance again after 5 years. Doesn't technology exist in this movie? Phone calls? E-mails? Airplanes? I would have fought nail and tooth to reunite with my loved one, and if failed, put some closure, within months, at most. This is so stupid!","APR 24, 2017",1.0,comedy

La La Land,"I feel like I'm taking CRAZY PILLS! La La Land wins the award for most overrated movie of year, perhaps decade. Does anyone remember Crash? The patronizing L.A. movie that trots out endless, unoriginal ""gee it makes you think"" race tropes. Crash, the Movie that beat Crouching Tiger in the Oscars, and then no one ever watched it or thought about it again? That's how overrated La La Land is. La La Land is a little bit different from the stereotypical musical, and wants the viewer to celebrate these tiny progressions as something artistic and revolutionary. There's no art here. There's no deeper truth. This is a sugar-coated musical that mechanically a little bit of conflict, a little bit of drama, a smattering of bittersweet notes in an attempt to seem real and genuine. But La La Land fails, the script is a **** formula out of a community college drama writing course. It's as fake and self-congratulatory as the Hollywood film industry, pretending to be brave, when it's really a cookie cutter drama. The sad thing is that, like Crash, the critics fell for it. The academy will probably fall for La La Land too. This movie will probably take attention and awards away from movies that deserve attention.","FEB 20, 2017",3.0,comedy
