Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"If I'm looking at this movie super critically it deserves a 7, but I'm going to give it an 8 because it's just such a fun movie. This movie isn't here for you to get super invested in its story. It's here to do two things: explain why the Death Star had a built flaw, and explain how the rebels got the Death Star plans. It does those two things very well. The best part of this movie is easily the ending, and that's true for most Star Wars movies. It's very easy to understand, the action is exciting, and it's well animated, choreographed, and acted, there's a lot is going on, but it never feels overwhelming. Finally, and I know that I'm going to sound like I'm joking when I say this but I'm not. The most refreshing thing about this movie is that the two main characters don't kiss at the end. I'm so sick of forced romance plots being shoved into movies that don't need them. This very franchise is guilty of that. They're just happy to exist next to each other, and that's refreshing in this generation of movies. If you want a fun Star Wars movie and nothing more then I'd say pick this one up. It's very fun, it doesn't really overstay your welcome, and it keeps a good pace throughout. By the time you're getting a bit tired of the final fight, it's over and we're into A New Hope territory. It's a fun movie, and that's all it really needed to be.","MAY 5, 2022",8,Fantasy
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"A Stunning masterpiece, which frankly comes as a massive shock following Disney's previous entries in the franchise. This film manages to rewrite the canon is a satisfying way that up to this point was inconceivable from modern Star Wars. The casting is great, the acting is on-point, the effects are generally phenomenal, and the use of practical effects really grounds it in the OT Era. Even the CGI de-aging while imperfect is satisfying enough.","SEP 5, 2022",8,Fantasy
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. For the sake of which everything that was in ""A New Hope"" happened. Star Wars has managed to create a truly dramatic and dark story. Great cast of actors and soundtrack perfectly complemented the whole picture. I would love to see more dark Star Wars like this. Also, the creators did not stint on a couple of nostalgic moments, showing us old and beloved characters. From a small minus, you can cancel a slightly bad attempt to return to the screens of characters whose actors have already left this world, which is why these computer faces and all their facial expressions are very striking.","NOV 27, 2022",9,Fantasy
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"I like this movie more than most people. I just find it to fit my tastes well. I heard it was supposed to be a very gritty war movie but Disney changed a lot. If I saw the original vision of the director, I would be ecstatic. Unfortunately, we don’t have the directors cut. Come one Disney, release their vision. I like how their wasn’t a forced romance which was really refreshing. K2SO was really funny. To me, he had R2 energy but talked. I won’t pretend the movie is perfect. It has pacing problems and some scenes really weren’t necessary. Also, the revived Peter Cushing was really weird but I prefer it to Mandolorian Season 2 Luke. Despite the plethora of problems, it’s still better than the other Disney Star Wars movies excluding Force Awakens. I just like it and that’s my opinion. We can like bad things ok? If I had to rate it without considering my intense enjoyment, it would probably be around 5-6.","AUG 30, 2022",8,Fantasy
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"This movie is very nice and it manages well in the function of explaining something more about star wars, there is not much to say precisely because the film is very nice but it has as its only flaw the fact that it can not make you emotionally bind enough with the main characters.","OCT 2, 2022",8,Fantasy
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"Rogue One: A Star Wars Story is a Star Wars movie that couldn't be more Star Wars. Set aside the Jedi and focused on the component of the Rebellion (finally!) the film does what it has to do. And it does it well.

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"I wasn't moved by Rogue One in the same way that I am by very good movies. It featured far too much forced humour, perhaps to make up for the gloom and melancholy it contained.

Begins with slower but well done character introductions and leads into a spectacular climax.

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"THE GOOD: Great cast and great chemistry between them, especially Jyn and Andor. The script is better than the ones from Episodes VII-VIII-IX combined. At the 90 minute mark I thought that this was a decent SW film but... what a third act!, peak Star Wars. Directly to my Top 2. And Lord Vader? AMAZING staging, Gareth Edwards showed him to us as what he is: the greatest villain ever. THE BAD: Maybe a bit of a slow beginning. Not every character is engaging.","SEP 20, 2022",9,Fantasy
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"Worthy of the Star Wars name. A decent story arc, distinct characters with personality, impressive locales and good action both in space and on the ground. Buildup and pacing is good and never boring, all leading up to the epic finale.

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"I dont know why this movie doesnt have much better reviews. I like this one: The story fits perfectly into the time between Episode 3 and 4, especially the connections with the costumes and the characters are obvious. The visual effects are also great and the action scenes are very good. The ending is good, something different than in many other movies. In addition the movie feels a lot like a Star Wars movie. Only the characters could have been more interesting, and some political correct elements are obvious.","MAY 22, 2022",9,Fantasy

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"After rewatching the entire franchise, it was a bit stunning to realize that Rogue One is the best movie in Star Wars lore. It's gritty, in a way that is fundamentally different from the other films, yet still contains enough levity for it to feel like a crowd pleaser. How it tied together the other films is the work of someone on the level of Michelangelo, how it presented characters, new and old, are exciting, honest, and perfectly executed. One of the greatest standalone movies in any franchise. A true treat to have watched this movie.","OCT 4, 2022",9,Fantasy

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"I'm old enough to remember Empire Strikes Back coming out. Star Wars was the biggest thing from my childhood, and without any hesitation I would call this the best Star Wars film since the original trilogy. It recaptures the magic and tone that none of the subsequent movies could. It is also puts the WARS in there, this is the grittiest and most violent film of the series, not gratuitous, but putting the growing armed conflict front and center. The characters are amazing, the worlds are amazing, and the build up is amazing. Gareth Edwards did what JJ and Rian ""Expectashunzzz"" Johnson completely failed at, and for that, he was fired.","MAR 21, 2023",8,Fantasy
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"Rogue One tells the story that immediately precedes the successful classic Star Wars trilogy, and, as a prequel, it succeeds in creating a climate and creating a desire to watch the films that come next. This film brilliantly shows the vast universe of Star Wars, respects its previously established characters such as Darth Vader, and manages to create epic battles and breathtaking moments. The final sequence of this film is such endless action that it leaves anyone impressed. Fantastic film, one of the best in the Star Wars universe.","NOV 21, 2023",8,Fantasy

Do. Not. Listen to them. This movie... oh, man, this movie...

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"The best Star Wars movie by Disney-Lucasfilm by a wide margin. The scenes with Vader, though unnecessary to the film, are well done and respectful to the character. CGI Leia was pretty cringy. CGI Tarkin was acceptable. The male and female leads are unlikable characters doing the right thing. The droid and the two priests of ""The Religion of the Force"" were the best parts of this movie.","MAR 10, 2019",6,Fantasy
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"This is a strange review to do for one major reason. I have never seen a movie when after I saw it I really can't remember much about it. I don't remember any characters names outside of Vader and Tarkin and they were barely in the movie. This has to be the most forgettable movie I have ever seen or at least in memory. I can't say I hate it ,for sure I can say I didn't like it. So this is tough to score and I even watched it a second time and when it was done I still couldn't remember much of any thing about the movie. I almost want to give this movie credit for being able to pull some thing like that off. To be able to make a movie that is orderless, tasteless, no texture, just plain forgettable is really some thing to me because normally any movie I could give you a real opionion on. I mean I'm not even going to tell you to not see it or avoid it. This is not like TFA or TLJ which are just awful movies which I could easily say there are pure trash. I don't know what more to say really. See it don't see it I don't know.","JUN 11, 2018",4,Fantasy

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"I would say I enjoyed much of the special effects of this movie but had lots of gripes with it. I take my Star Wars seriously as many fans do and I just found the main character to be so lackluster to try and carry this film. Underwhelming characters throughout the film made the film as a whole just 'alright'. The droid was very funny. Darth Vader was cool in the end, but his interactions with Krenig were somewhat cringy, but not as much as the CGI Grand Moff and Leia. Overall I didn't hate it, but It was not very noteworthy either.","NOV 17, 2017",6,Fantasy

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"For existing Star Wars fans only, Rogue One offers little for newcomers to the franchise.

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"Incredible cinematography, incredibly bad scenario. Rogue One, as an adjunct entry to the Star Wars franchise is fascinating in terms of cinematography, casting, scenery and costume, character design and overall CGI quality. However, it fails horribly to deliver a scenario that is up to the Star Wars quality. The quality of the film itself as a motion picture is overshadowed by the horrendous premise and conclusion, combined with mediocre acting.

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"I didn't know about the Star Wars anthology movies until I learnt about Solo. I didn't know anything about it, so I went in completely blind. The only thing I knew about this movie is the Darth Vader scene, and I thought if it has that scene, it must be having plenty such scenes. Turns out that scene is to this movie what Flash and Superman's slow motion fight is to Josstice League: The only one good scene in the entire movie. Most of this movie is just talking, talking and more talking. I won't complain about it though. I didn't know the ""We were on the verge of greatness"" meme was from this. I used to think that meme is about an agriculture scientist from Discovery telling how his experiment failed. So subsequently the ""Are we blind? Deploy the troops!"" meme also had to be from here, another one I didn't know where it was from. I ended up liking K2SO, he was my favourite character from the movie. I felt really bad seeing him die. The action scenes of this movie are very good, now that I think back about it, especially the one with the blind Jedi. The scene where a droid that looked like H2SO gets shot and then the actual H2SO comes from the back saying, ""I hope you knew it was not me."" was hilarious. But that's the only scene I remember, other than the Darth Vader scene of course. Most of the scenes from this movie are very forgettable. Out of the over 2 hour of runtime, I only remember barely 2 minutes from it combined. I don't see the point behind the making of this movie. It just answers a question nobody asked. I wasn't even paying attention because I was waiting for the Darth Vader scene, as I had begun thinking it isn't in this movie until the very end. I could definitely give it a rewatch whenever I get a Disney+ Hotstar connection, but that's really far from today.","JUL 9, 2021",6,Fantasy
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"The movie was interesting, visually great with some great action. However, it falls flat to me because the characters were lacking.

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"Mediocre at best. This film is better than the main line Disney Star Wars films, but if we're honest with ourselves that not saying much. The storyline is dull and predictable, the acting is passable and the visual effects are good. My biggest gripe with the film is the way the ""bad guys"" (the Empire) are portrayed. Instead of the Heroes overcoming incredible odds against a tough enemy, but ultimately being victorious, the Empire is this film are instead bumbling morons who consistantly either do nothing or act to directly thwart their own plans. The best example of this is when the fleet turns up around the data core planet, the Rebels quite literaly could not have won if the Empire fleet had not turned up and ruined everything! Also the blind monk on the beach scene... to quote Han Solo ""thats not how the force works!"" The biggest saving grace of this film is the final scene on Tantive IV with Darth Vader. Possibly one of the best action sequences set to film and providing a clever and much needed tie in to the original trilogy. Although by no means a must watch, if you find yourself at a loose end there are certainly worse things you can watch.","NOV 8, 2018",5,Fantasy

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"Rogue One is better off and more relative in being a 30-minute intro-setup movie for A New Hope and the rest of the original 3 Star Wars movies. But as a movie all its own, as the Star Wars Story it's meant to be, it does fall a tad short on what could've been a very interesting solo Star Wars tale. It's intentions are good, it's build-up is strong, but the movie lacks focus or coherence for the first hour or so. But once our characters begin to set out on the mission of their lives, the gears amp up and so does the emotion. Rogue One goes out like some beautifully tragic pre-movie to a video game, in the most epic fashion imaginable. Including an escape sequence involving an iconic character, that's made to shock your nerves. But outside of it's final lap, Rogue One doesn't really have that appeal or rewatchable quality to it you'd think it'd easily have. Only for its send-off experience, but the movie as a whole as a story, and as an experience is all about the ending and not so much about it's foundation.","MAY 14, 2019",6,Fantasy

Rogue One was devoid of any good characters, and that's really disappointing. I can't even remember the name of the main character. These bland characters cause me to not care in the slightest when they died. I only cared when the robot died because so don't need to give a robot character development. You can't blame the director for this, because of things he has said in interview. That being said, the action scenes are cool, and the CGI was good.

A whole generation of people is growing up with crap Star Wars stories. Everything's too sterile, too kid safe, too merchandise ready.

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"TLDR: Director was lazy and didn't build the hero character up to fit with the narrative, so much so that the movie has you scratching your head and the story becomes ridiculous and forced. The movie would have been really good if they didn't ruin the story. So the main female character's father works for the empire which makes her automatically distrusted in rebel circles due to that reputation. However, to create a strong female character they completely forgot the story they are telling and suddenly she becomes a hero without merit but for some reason the rebels in one scene all gather around her so that she can inspire them with her wisdom as they kneel and look up at her in awe. Now remember she is a nobody at this point, she was captured by the rebels literally minutes earlier and thought to work for the empire and they wanted to use her to connect to the father but here she is giving motivational speeches to rebels that are about to enter battle. The story doesn't make sense. I would understand if she did some heroic act earlier, maybe saved a couple rebels or something then that pure respect and treating her like a hero would have some merit, however she did nothing. She was captured, called an empire spy and then became a rebel hero. Now the story is drivel, it's ridiculous and seems like the director was trying to push some political narrative throughout the movie. But I still recommend watching it for one of the best star wars scenes ever. The introduction of vader to the rebels. That short scene where he fights in the hall way had me jump out of the seat a shout at the screen. It was amazing. I'm not a huge star wars fan but that single scene was the best thing I've seen out of all the movies","MAR 25, 2017",3,Fantasy

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"Here is my reasoning for giving it a 3/10. The first act is boring, uninteresting beyond the fact it's Star Wars, and I don't care about anyone. The second act, is terribly written, characters don't make sense, but there's some good lines and some tension purely based on me liking Mads Mikkelsen as an actor and not wanting him to die because most other actors are doing a bad job. The third act is pretty good, everyone dies which is predictable and bad because the only character I liked was the robot, so I was sad when he died but nobody else mattered. Had to google Chirrut's friends name because I literally didn't know it from this movie because his character didn't mattered. The vader scene is cool, and all around good visuals. Here's the conclusion. I only liked one of the three acts, and I didn't love it, but the visuals were good all around so I can't give it higher than like a 33%.

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"If someone is deprived of cookies for a long time and then they get a cookie - they believe that cookie to be delicious, much more delicious than it actually is. Well, deliciousness is subjective but at any rate they over-exaggerate it's quality, which brings me to Rogue One, which is actually quite a bland film that just cashes in on the franchise. Ok so I like the move away from CGI, but even that was wrecked by their insistence on resurrecting a very dodgy, fake looking Peter Cushing. How do we know he'd have agreed to star in this anyway? Talk about Liberties. So the characters are all pretty bland, especially the lead who has one facial expression for most of the movie. I don't know what Forest Whitaker's up to with that performance either, talk about over the top. Shame he couldn't lend Felicity a few of those facial expressions seeing as he has so many. Someone just make a good Star Wars film please. How hard can it be when you have all that money? Let's have something a bit original, a bit daring, not this spoon-fed pap.","APR 3, 2017",3,Fantasy

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"Absolute garbage, even worse than the Phantom Menace. Every character is a cliche mess of terrible and cringey overacting. The only good part of the movie is the Vader scene at the end and when all the crappy characters die. The ending is the most cliche **** garbage I've ever seen. It's as if the writers read a book about the most overused movie endings in history and used every example they could. The main villain corners the hero, pointing his blaster at her. But instead of shooting her, he decides to give this long monologue first, and the moment before he pulls the trigger, a character who you assumed died (unfortunately he didn't) magically appears and shoots the villain, saving the hero. Instead of finishing him off, they instead walk off into the sunset while the villain is killed by his own creation. Also the last two living characters suddenly make out as they escape despite the fact of having zero chemistry or the slightest hint of attraction to each other throughout the movie. I know Disney likes to pander to children, but please don't use them to write your **** script.","NOV 20, 2017",3,Fantasy
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"The reviews hyped me up for this. So I went in expecting an above average movie. What I found was a cliche fest that didn't bother to create an atmosphere or develop its characters. This movie is all about the final battle, which is OK, but unfortunately there's half a movie before it. The first part of the movie, where the development should be, is soulless exposition. WE'RE HERE, ON THIS PLANET, AND THIS HAPPENED, OH ANOTHER PLANET, THAT HAPPENED, ANOTHER ONE, THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW! It really feels like they went through a checklist of what they wanted to tell the audience and did the minimum effort possible to inform us. We hop from location to location, before we can even start recognizing each one, being told what we should be told and on to the next item on the checklist. A bunch of characters enter the story with no backstory, the starting ones have sudden changes of heart with no explanation. This first part needed to be a 3-hours movie or a miniseries to decently introduce everything they want to introduce for the final battle, but it's only part of a 2-hours movie and got cut to show us the bare minimum, and that decision is what ruined this movie. The final battle is actually entertaining. Completely predictable, cliche and sometimes nonsensical - after you watch it, ask yourself how the male lead got out of where we last saw him and up to the place where he saves the female lead - but it's good CGI and lots of explosions in a beautiful location, what's not to like? In fact this movie would be easily a 7/10 if it started directly at the battle, without wasting our time before it. This is a movie made to profit from nostalgia. If you're not a rabid fan, don't waste your time. Or go directly to the final battle scene.","FEB 13, 2017",3,Fantasy

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"There you have it, it's done: Disney is going to milk the big moribund Star Wars cow into indigestion! you will have one per year or even two during leap years and birthdays! you are going to eat Star Wars until your mouth is open and... may the ""force"" be with you, because you will need it very much. ""The Force Awakens"" didn't really wake me up, but for a first attempt from Disney, it could have been worse... With this ""Rogue One"", we have taken a step forward: we are went from average to bad, because Snape thing is bad, not bad at all no, but very bad! However, it was a matter of embroidering something around the ending that we already know: stealing the plans for the Death Star and the little Princess already alluded to it in episode VI (uh... c Is it 6? I have a doubt now, well, the initial Star Wars from 77, you see...); she mentioned the immense sacrifices and therefore to imagine a suicide mission, why not, I say bank! Only here, the screenwriters at Disney write with their ass, probably because they have faces full of coke that they snort with 100 dollar bills. So, it's just nonsense at the sub-level of this sub-story whose characters are all as lame as each other. Two or three stars come to make a fool of themselves in there, thinking that it will look good on their CV, while the other branques, strangers in the battalion, are paid the minimum wage and play like poor dudes. In fact, it's so bad in the ""Rebellion"" that it looks like gypsies raiding the funfair with their big caravans, after about 1h25, when it (finally) starts to really go crazy . And there, the space and ground battles are going strong and the special effects are unleashed. Better **** than never as they say. Then the end eventually arrives, quite grotesque and in the middle of which the two flank circles come together: it's pathetic! the music starts squealing, trying to make us feel... what? emotion perhaps? no, at most we feel a gentle commiseration, unless it is actually pity. And before that, we have a bunch of bad guys from this descent of losers who want to play “7 mercenaries” on us! we would love to be able to laugh about it if it wasn't so pathetic, really. Not to mention these two characters from the original trilogy recycled here in computer-generated images, they must be turning in their graves. This cold **** in any case, I say respect! I'm wide awake now.","APR 13, 2017",3,Fantasy

Its neat to see it from a different perspective, but the acting, is just horrid.. the female protagonist, is one of the WORST actors Ive ever seen.. The dialog is laughable (even Darth Vader at one point, says something completely juvenile.. Using Force Choke ""Dont choke on your asperations, commander""... So corney, and not Vader at all).. The opening 30mins is a constant jump around, with no clue by the viewer whats going on, and who is who.. Forrest Whitacker does an equally cringe job acting, as the female lead.. Basically, the entire movie, is the lead designer of the original Death Star, and how he was conflicted in doing so, and so built in the ridiculous plot to the original Star Wars.. Deliberately designing the weakness for the rebellion..

Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,"I found the movie to be technically amazing as far as stunts, CGI, costumes and action scenes go. But I didn't find it very entertaining. There's so little backstory given to the main characters and their personalities just didn't really stand out. They simply got ping ponged from one location to the next until all of them eventually died so as not to conflict with the rest of the movies. The dialogue shared between them is mostly related to advancing the plot as opposed to expressing who the characters really are. They seemed like copy and paste cut outs to me. The action scenes in Star Wars movies have always relied on some suspension of disbelief. But the ridiculousness was just too much for me in Rogue One. A droid casually chucking a grenade behind it's back as a gang of storm troopers round the corner. Donnie Yen one shotting a tie fighter out of the sky with a laser crossbow. A group of conveniently placed metal boxes laid out in front of the empire garrison's main door used by the rogue rebels to ambush dozens of hapless, brain dead storm troopers. And of course Donnie Yen walking across a raging battlefield without consequence muttering the same line over and over like a religious fanatic. Apparently the force is no longer needed for fighting people with it. As long as one has faith in the force they can just walk around in god-mode while the force carries out their unstoppable destiny for them. Oh, and of course there's the oft repeated trope of a main character appearing dead, only to then pop up behind the bad guy, just as the bad guy's about to shoot his gun, only to make it seem like the bad guy shot his gun, when it was in fact the good guy who shot the bad guy in the back, which is revealed to the viewer when the bad guy hits the ground dead. *Cue triumphant music* The movie was just dull and comically predictable for me. But I really wasn't that surprised. Rogue One is most likely all the franchise will ever be. A rehash of cliches, references to the original, comedic interludes and CGI simulations of scenes from the originals for nostalgia's sake. With that being said, I thoroughly enjoyed the darth vader scene at the end. That scene was **** amazing.","AUG 28, 2017",3,Fantasy

The Shape of Water,"It is easy to see why Guillermo del Toro's 'The Shape of Water' won Best Picture at the Oscars. It mixes its ideas and concepts with luxurious and exquisitely designed cinematography, ever-present and polished score and a near compulsive obsession with details when it comes to set decoration. All in all, this is a very pretty film to watch. But, this is not what makes it special. It is rather the way this imagery is not shallow and pedantic without any effect. Del Toro puts his money where his mouth is and presents us with true ambitious directing and writing when it comes to presenting the love story between a mute janitor Eliza (Sally Hawkins) working at a top secret research facility during the Cold War era and 'The Asset'; an amphibious and marvelous creature. You wanted diversity? Honestly, it doesn't get more diverse than this. Still, there are a few flaws, unfortunately. Despite the near-perfect pacing of the action and daring but at the same time tamed sex scenes, there are a few hiccups here and there that break the magic of this fantastical love story. Like Giles' (Richard Jenkins), Eliza's only friend, **** approach towards a friendly waiter and a racist scene involving the same waiter not letting a Negro couple sit at the table. Of course, this all makes sense, its the 60s. It is easy to compare 'The Shape of Water' with del Toro's 2006 masterpiece, ""Pan's Labyrinth"", both involving a fantastic hidden world in a political unsettling backdrop, but the magic is cut short here. There is also a scene in which Eliza dreams of singing and dancing with the monster, which is beautiful but is also a bit cringe-worthy. Yet the amphibious creature is more than it seems. It presents supernatural powers of healing and displays superiority against his captor, Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon) a supremacist and self-loathing American man charged with the security of The Asset. Why did it show its powers so late in the film, its a mystery. But at least its powers are renowned, for as Strickland, considering the beast a primitive and inferior being, in the end claims 'F**k, you are a god!' If it wasn't for the sublime and crystal polished execution of all its technical elements (and some artistic ones) this film would have been worse. But, let's not forget that is the imagery and the sound the exclusive elements of cinema. I mean, the Academy definitely holds true to this and respects filmmakers which endorse that idea.","APR 15, 2018",8,Fantasy
The Shape of Water,"The Shape of Water explores how institutional ableism can halt the progression of science, creation of friendships, and effectiveness of a bureaucracy. The Shape of Water is a well-oiled takedown of not only the nuclear family but also the overly romanticized cold war era and suburban family. Eliza Esposito (Sally Hawkins) is a tragic hero, a loving soul trapped in a mute body, forced to deal with brutal workplace harassment. Sally Hawkins gives an excellent performance and Richard Jenkins portrays an equally tortured character, a freelance artist exploited and tooled about by Corporate America who pursues a path of unrequited **** love. The creature effects are on par with del Toro’s past projects, i.e. utterly phenomenal. The Shape of Water’s only major flaw is that Strickland (Michael Shannon) is too cartoonish of a villain.","APR 21, 2020",9,Fantasy

I liked the Crimson Peak movie before that but I could not show success in the same way.I am very pleased that Guillermo del Toro has succeeded in this film, which is a favorite of almost every film. Now let's just say that I'm not really a super movie but I did not give a lot of information about the creature and I could not understand some places for example, what is this creature, what is the place, how it got in and how it got caught. Why all the people behaved close to the elisa while torturing him and he did not see him as a monster the super powers of creation could do a lot of things, but I could not understand some of the details about it, so I finally remember how Elisa eventually turned into something like that and the scar was on the other side. but the movie really took me to a whole new world.

The movie is quite bland to me in the second half of the film. It starts off brilliantly, with a great script and beautiful production design. The film doesn't quite reach those levels in the second half, with it just feeling way too forced and dull. The ending is great though, with a heart-wrenching sequence.

The design of the creature is amazing! The lead actress (Sally Hawkins) compliments the story and the support actor (Richard Jenkins) does a wonderful narration. What I hated. When a world is presented as realistic, it posses a question as to what exactly ""realistic"" means. As far as I know, the only two mythical components are the creature and Elisa. Any government, at any time of handling such a sensitive asset would not behave in this way. Any one who knows about area 51 can tell how guarded alien evidence is handled (Even if it's the 1960's). The creature is not only alien but has proven to poses abilities and the Russians aren't interested when told? How cleaning ladies managed is not only unbelievable but an insult to how sensitive government information is handled. There weren't even guards at the cleaning vans and only one camera that was easily tilted up because they left barrels underneath. Are there no guards watching this kind of sensitive asset or this government can't afford 2 or 5 more guards. This kind of incompetence is very subtle and littered through out the movie. It is every clear that Guillermo Del Toro shows us how characters out wit the government on a bases of clumsiness and luck. With that said; clumsiness and luck aren't uncommon. There is a ton that I love and the pros out weigh the cons. I recommend to not only watch this movie but it falls in my category or must owns. I give the Shape of Water a 8.5 out of 10.

The script, at first is too slow and takes time to establish the main plot, but at the end (in the last 15 minutes) everything is solved fast and forced.

I hope he does not take the Oscar for Best Movie.","FEB 5, 2018",4,Fantasy

The Shape of Water,"As a big fan of Guillermo del Toro, I don't get the hype. Sure, it's a well polished movie with solid performances and dialogue. But it's predictable to the point of being boring and completely lacks the imaginative creativity that is the hallmark of movies like Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy, Cronos and even Pacific Rim, to a lesser extent. Just does not even feel like a del Toro movie to me at all.","FEB 2, 2018",6,Fantasy
The Shape of Water,"The movie was fine while I was watching. I mean... he managed to keep me attentive for two hours, at least. But once it was over and I started thinking about what I'd just seen, I had a hard time remembering anything that WAS NOT mediocre. Del Toro throws and throws scenes in the final film and many of them are useless (in general all the secondary plot lines are omittable), and he also gets involved in agreeing a social message that is too indiscreet to leave the viewer thinking for itself. The last act is almost entirely Hollywood bric-a-brac: if your plot requires all the characters to act like idiots for your ending to have the slightest bit of fun, then you're doing something wrong. The final lines are kitsch worthy of a soap opera for teenagers. Ignore all that.","MAR 6, 2018",5,Fantasy
The Shape of Water,"It is a nice movie technically, the intensity of the scenes and the performances of the cast are what kept me in the movie until the end. Octavia Spencer and Richard Jenkins were great and Michael Shannon was fantastic. But there one major flaw for me personally that made me enjoy the movie way less... I did not believe in their love, The main character and the humanoid amphibians loved is basically just based in their difficulty in communication, because that what they showed us, so it seems really shallow, so i think that took the magic of what could have been a fantastic movie.","JAN 20, 2018",6,Fantasy
The Shape of Water,"I have tried to reconcile my feelings about this film ever since the end credits began. By the time I'd walked into this film, my expectations were high. Not only was I already excited to see a new Del Toro film, being a somewhat ""fan"" of much of his work, the movie had also garnered a lot of hype and praise. Now that the film is in my rearview mirror and steadily fading farther back, I can safely give my review. While visually stunning and well acted, The Shape of Water came off as Abe Sapien playing The Creature from the Black Lagoon. There is no new tale to tell here. There is no fresh look at story telling. The Beauty and the Beast is over 200 years old, and there are any number of incarnations of it. And while the characters are well developed, each having their own quirks, they are poorly used support an unfortunately simple plot. I'd wanted so much more from this film, such as a pace suitable for the plot drivers and a memorable scene or two just as Pan's Labyrinth had (which continues to call itself as a comparable film for Del Toro for me). Sadly I got neither. There were certainly moments, but no scene really stood out as a pinnacle force. As it stands, The Shape of Water is good. Not great, just good. I'll simply have to wait for another art-house movie from Guillermo to be released and hope what will surely be my high expectations aren't dashed.","MAR 28, 2018",5,Fantasy

Because its a fantasy they get to create a world were everything is a charicature, and if this wins an Oscar, then exactly why not a comic book movie like Logan?

Why such an advanced facility doesn't have cameras in the place it needs them the most? Why simple janitor can on her own easily access classified compartments of said facility and for what reason? Main heroine's motivation is really hard to swallow throughout the whole movie. It seems like it misses a good 20 minute chunk where the bonding between 2 lovers would be properly established.

The Shape of Water,"While this is by far Guillermo Del Toro's worst film, it still isn't bad overall by normal standards. Visually it is typical Del Toro. It is engaging and charming. Clever use of framing, setting, even costumes shows a keen eye and clear grasp of his craft. This is among his best visually. Pacing is off, but typical of his work. If you know Del Toro, you come to expect it and just cope. If you are not familiar, his second act is always a the weak part of his films. Don't expect a lot here and you won't be disappointed. Audio is complimentary, without distraction, though it is also not helping to drive it either. It is overall 'meh', but also not unusual for Del Toro. If you know him, this will also not phase you. Most others will not even notice. Character development is not overly deep. The main couple is somewhat deep, but the antagonist is simply a parody. Normally the antagonists have depth and you find some level of sympathy with them, but not here. This is just a mockery, but one that is disconcerting as it mocks everything one should hold dear. I can't get into it without spoilers, but this is the most problematic part of this film. Combined with the overall narrative, this is where the movie falls apart. How it could even be nominated for an Oscar is beyond me. If you have seen Hellboy, you are going to be overly familiar with the whole movie. If you aren't, don't worry because the foreshadowing is so clear that it smacks you in the face and calls you a loser. This is by far the worst story I've seen in some time. The fact that Del Toro wrote this just highlights the trend of directors shouldn't write their movies. From George Lucas to this, great writers will generally never make great directors, and vice versa. Somehow this D list horror/comedy movie in the vein of of ""Saturday the 14th"" and ""Love at First Bite"" is getting an Oscar nod just highlights how the industry has fallen.","MAR 1, 2018",5,Fantasy

The Shape of Water,"I'm in the ""disappointed"" camp too. Guillermo Del Toro obviously despises everything that has to do with traditional values, and made a movie about it. The only three-dimensional characters are the outcasts, the misfits; everyone else is evil, sanctimonius and plain stupid. I don't think this is what the USA in the 60s really were like, even though I have no way of knowing for sure, I see it more as a caricature, a summary of what was wrong cranked up to 11. The movie suffers for it. The antagonist is despicable in every possible way, and this is especially a pity becasue I've always loved Del Toro's magnetic villains. Not just the superb, sad and poetic prince Nuada, after all that was a fantasy movie, but even the Francoist Colonel in Pan's Labyrinth was evil to the core - but also fearless and tougher than nails. The villain in this movie is not only evil, but also weak, clueless, stupid and ridiculed even in the way he pisses! It's the caricature of a villain in a caricature of the USA, for a caricature of a Del Toro movie: unfortunately the director let his sensibilities get the better of his judgement. Definitely not worth a ""Best Film"" Oscar, IMHO.","SEP 10, 2019",5,Fantasy
The Shape of Water,"Bland 'Beauty and the Beast'-type story that throws in every cliché in the book. Ham-fisted messages of treating the unknown with respect, while noble in theory, are really a thinly veiled excuse for del Toro to showcase his (admittedly innocuous) fish porn fantasies. What we really found offensive was the gratuitous cat-head eating scene; it's these more gruesome fetishes we wish del Toro would dial down before he translates them to the big screen. All in all, average at best.","SEP 8, 2018",5,Fantasy

The Shape of Water,Shape of water is a well crafted movie with all the usual trademark del toro charm in effect here. A sometimes interesting very visual journey that tells a very familiar story to a high standard.

This sea-man is in the clutches of a sadistic military security officer who wants to kill and dissect him. So the maid decides she needs to try to rescue this being. Del Toro portrays the early 1960s as a time of oppressive conformity, cold war, **** et cetera, and the story becomes a very obvious parable about the struggles of those who are different from the norm.

The Shape of Water,"This movie is a beautiful paradox --- a wolf in sheep's clothing. I adore Guillermo del Toro's work, but it appears in this case as he is writer/story creator/director, that his angers have melted his own fabric. Parts of this movie are really mind-blowingly beautiful --- The intro (wow what imagery!!!) whether-or-not you think it works, the lady's complexity, her buddy, and the monster's skin and movements ( and breathing in that suit... which doesn't look like a suit to me ), the art throughout the movie in drawings // cinematography // set dressing ... leaves me breathless, the acting and care to echo the look of the original monster... Or to be more exact: Doug Jones acting as the monster, Sally Hawkins soulful mute, Octavia Spencer's perfectly timed humor, Michael Stuhlbarg's subtle inner conflictions ... Richard Jenkins, well, I just love watching his acting .... .. the love. Two people - beings - getting together because they get each other. BUT : and it's a big but : [ spoiler alert ] Del Toro writes-in such a livid attack on America ( the US ) and the American Military, along with questionable points of view -- RE: the sex scenes on mental desire for **** (and actual minutes of burning film with its play-reenactment), and through-out the film specifically outlining the American military and all white Americans as cruel, unjust, and selfish, to the tenth power/squared/cubed... !!!!!! Yes - there was sexism, racism, and a whole bunch of bad stuff ( mafia... ) - there still is in this world. Google ""racism in Mexico"". Try ""white Irish treated as apes in America 1800s"". Even Malcolm X noted racism is the black-white issue in the US - but religion was the culprit of overseas (reference Alex Haley's ""Malcolm X""). But it was highlighted as the *only* way of life for these 2-3 people - it was the **** man, the mute girl, and the black community, against the selfish white American Military and ignorant white American store keeper. This is a fable, ""the creature from the black lagoon"" -- not : the creature vs selfish white United States. It just slowly twists and twists that point --- and leaves me with a what-the-heck-is-this-film-about bad taste after viewing. So gorgeous -- and so .... eeeech .... Ummmm.... what does that have to do with the creature from the lagoon? And okay -- you want to deal with the racism at the time -- show it in all its colors (pun intended) : the Irish being treated as apes and not given jobs, the ""whites"" who did stand up for equality and weren't **** or mute, the Military people that fought for our country to be what it is: free, so we can then duke out the further freedoms of the present day for women's rights, men's rights, animal/land/building rights and you name it.... HE is allowed to do films here -- because it's America !!! Del Toro has a lot of anger spatting out in this film, in one sided ways. I wish there were ways to click and say ""here here!!"" to Rex Reed's review... I saw the movie and a dear friend and I can totally understand what he is talking about. Unfortunately he might be so overwhelmed with its problems (been there myself if that is the case) that some points which make this movie a miss are not noted as well as some points which make it a win, perhaps under Reed's shock and questioning of how so many adore.

No spoilers here, but it wouldn't matter; there are no surprises. I won't fault a film for lack of originality if it's otherwise rewarding to watch. This was not. By the predictable end, contrivances and pacing had worn away whatever sympathy I'd felt obliged as an audience member to try to feel for the characters. I made the mistake of reading reviews, hoping to find some insight into why movies like these are so celebrated critically. But professional critics, in real publications, seem unable to write positively of these sorts of movies in anything other than a prose matching the grandeur of the ""lush visuals"" therein. It's as though a sea creature's spiny appendage pierced through their skulls and deposited a sense not only of the film's significance, but of their own. I'd give it a zero, but some acknowledgement will go to the effort put into the stagnant, boring visual compositions that critics love (and which I don't care about, but take skill to achieve, I would assume), and to the actors for keeping a straight face.","FEB 25, 2018",1,Fantasy

The Shape of Water,"To be honest, the whole premise of a love story between a woman and some weird merman seemed unattractive to me to begin with, but the Oscars did their advertising job in the end. And my intuition did not fail, Shape of Water is boring, weird, and overly-sweet all at the same time. To start with the good things - visually it's well-filmed and the 60's are stylishly presented. It's nothing ground-breaking, but overall solid. The second good aspect are the actors, everyone plays their roles convincingly. I would point out Michael Shannon in particular, he proved that he can be a great antagonist before, and he's done it again, I was actually rooting for his character throughout. However, the story is a dull bizarre mess. To begin with, it is overwhelmingly unoriginal - the sheepish sugar-sweet lonely protagonist, the captive creature that is tortured instead of being communicated with, the army man antagonist. The movie is just a drag, and everything is as predictable as it can be. Now I can buy the ancient overused trope about the protagonist empathizing to some captive intelligent creature, but explicitly having sex with it? And yeah, there's actually plenty of unnecessary nudity (Shannon shags his wife. Ok.) and allusions to the creature's ****. Well, whatever gets you that Oscar, I guess. I mean I'm no prune, but in my opinion nudity is justified when it helps to convey some point and flesh out the story. But this, this just looks like Del Toro's sick creepy sexual fantasies brought to life. Sorry, but my suspension of disbelief just doesn't cover the ""woman gets turned on by slippery scaly aquatic monster"" thing. What's your next move, Del Toro, a movie about furries? To add to that, there's an absolutely redundant meaningless side plot about a **** old man failing to hook up with another guy, and couple of scenes dedicated to showing that Shannon's character has a sexual fetish for silence. That's when you thought this movie couldn' get any more creepy. And since we're at it, I would really question how realistic it is that some random cleaners are allowed access to classified assets in a top-secret research facility. There's also an uncomfortably stereotypical black woman who overcompensates for the muteness of the main character, never managing to finally shut the hell up. Also at one point the movie has a musical number in it, like in some Disney flick. That was also the moment when my facepalm intensity peaked. Yeah, and isn't this merman's design very reminiscent of some sidekick of Hellboy in Del Toro's own movie? Pathetic. So, as they say, best movie my ass.

Once again cruelty and images that were simply UNNECESSARY. - The way the sex scene with the security guy and his wife was filmed was also just really pointless. They couldn't have been under the blanket? Come on! It's always sad to see how all of the things that made the movie rated R, also ruined the whole experience. Because of the things I mentioned above, the movie lost its beauty. Nothing was even as funny as it could have been. I was just waiting for the movie to be over so I could find out how it ends. But it was NOT worth it.","FEB 21, 2018",0,Fantasy
The Shape of Water,"The Shape of Water is by far the most overrated film I have ever seen. I honestly can't understand why critics loved it so much and why this film won so many Best Picture awards. The Shape of Water is a fantasy/romantic film. It's like watching Disney's The Beauty and The Beast in live action with a different setting. The story is awful (a mute woman falls in love with a captured beast/alien), the plot defies any kind of logic (what kind of army lets some janitors mopping around in the high security room where their biggest and top secret asset is stored?), the characters are annoying AF and their decisions are utterly stupid to say the least. I have to say Sally Hawkins steals the show with her acting (even though her lead character is written to be as bland as the rest), and the 1960s period setting fits the film perfectly. But it's not enough to save this mediocre (at best) movie. The Shape of Water is one of a very few movies that I regret watching due to hype. If this film is worthy of winning so many awards, then Micheal Bay's Transformers movies should dominate the Oscars and win at least 10 Academy Awards every time a movie's out.","MAY 6, 2018",2,Fantasy

The Shape of Water,"This is pretty much every creature movie ever. Misunderstood creature with magical healing powers befriended by a powerless woman who tries to help him escape - has been done much better in Frankenstein, King Kong, ET, etc. In case you didn't get the point, let's make the powerless woman mute and throw in some other powerless outcasts: a **** man (this is the 1960's) and an African-American woman. A cartoonishly bad bad guy - haven't we gotten tired of the evil scientist cliche? - some cartoonish Russians, complete with bungled silly passwords (""The eagle takes the pigeon for its prey""), and a creature that looks like a guy in a rubber mask. Lord of the Rings had plenty of guys in rubber masks, but they had actors that could turn them into believably alien creatures. Here it just looks like a guy in a rubber mask. And don't get me started on all the plot absurdities (cleaning women allowed free run of a room with a secret and dangerous creature, for example). With all the hype and awards, I expected much, much more.","MAR 11, 2018",2,Fantasy
The Shape of Water,"This movie is seriously overrated. There is no denying the striking visuals. From dingy apartments to dream-like underwater scenes, the cinematography is beautiful. That gets the movie a 1. Unfortunately, the plot is thin as water and the pace is leaden. The length of the film is twice as long as this short story full of caricatures requires. The movie's biggest flaw is that we are supposed to feel something for the fishman because he is 'intelligent'. Instead he is portrayed as feral with a smaller vocabulary than Koko the gorilla or your family dog... neither one of which should you want to see anyone have sex with. The romance is imaginary and one sided. Towards the end we see Elisa pour her heart out to fishman who doesn't stop eating to even pay attention. This movie is for really lonely women who may find it moving. I found it as romantic as a woman with box of frozen fishsticks and want my two hours back.","NOV 3, 2018",1,Fantasy

Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker,"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker. True evil has returned. And here it is! After 40 years, the space, epic and generally galactic opera about the Skywalker family ended. I can imagine what a huge responsibility it was for the director and the whole team to put an end to such a long story. What can be said about this point. It is clearly better done than a point in one high-profile fantasy series (we will not say the name). J. J. Abrams put a good end to this story, giving credit to each character. Technically the film looks great (space flights and battle scenes). But in the very plot of the whole film, as if something was missing on a larger scale, and if it were not for the finale, then perhaps the 9th part was perceived in the same way as the previous 2 episodes. What else the film was very hooked on is the nostalgic moments of which there were enough in the film and they took for the soul, for this I will immediately give +1 point to the piggy bank.

Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker,"A good movie with a heap of gaping flaws: Every character except Kylo and Rey has no character traits now, it feels like two movies smooshed into one, they set up an interesting story for Poe and go nowhere with it in the third act, the conclusion to Finn's arc is weak, Palpatine's return retcons Anakin's Chosen One prophecy, which was one of the main plot points of Episodes I, II, III, and retrospectively VI, Kylo being counted as a Sith goes against the lore set up in Episode VII, the kiss between Ben and Rey is utterly ridiculous, most character development from Episode VIII is retconned in favor of Abrams' own vision, which retrospectively makes that movie worse because the characters were the whole point, Rose is barely in the movie, Jannah could have been really cool but the writers didn't give her a character, Lando's reintroduction feels cheap and he doesn't really do anything in the movie, Palpatine having a bunch of Star Destroyers under the ground makes zero sense, the Knights of Ren do absolutely nothing... The list goes on. In an attempt to ""fix"" The Last Jedi, the filmmakers created an incoherent, fan-pleasing mess of a film that disrespects both the two movies in the trilogy that came before it and the series as a whole. So, you may be asking, why did I give it a positive rating? I think people get so caught up in the film's admittedly numerous flaws that they forget it also has good qualities. The whole Rey-Palpatine thing isn't executed perfectly, but it does add some extra depth to Rey's character, and provides some interesting character moments. Kylo's redemption is beautifully done. They did a fantastic job honoring Carrie Fisher and her character, even after her passing. Rey and Kylo's friendship is good except for the kiss. The world-building is quite interesting. Babu Frik is awesome. There's a surprising poeticism to the film's final act. The list for this goes on as well. While it certainly has a plethora of flaws, you can still tell the filmmakers tried, and that they cared. Next time you watch it, maybe look for the good qualities, too. 7/10.","JUL 30, 2023",7,Fantasy

Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker,"While this may have been my least favorite movie in the sequel trilogy, it was only because it felt far too rushed. Star Wars has always had way too much stuff crammed into the final movie because the build up in the first two movies never fully completes the vision of the whole trilogy enough to make a properly placed movie. I'm sure this movie would have been LOTR length to have gotten it the way it should have been. I definitely think there was a lot of extended lore packed in, especially with the final battle, that really were put in there to pull from extended sources and lore. Those should have been explored in the previous films more. There are little details about the movie, like the books from the Jedi Temple that Rey saved and learned from, that really made it a bit more cohesive, but they should have decided to make the themes of this film more compressed rather than broad and expansive, leaving the movie feeling rushed and hollow. I don't think this really gave the Sequels justice, but as someone who really binged a lot of Star Wars material because of the Sequels, I think it really is something that is both bolstered and hindered by the saga and universe it resides in. I would say you should not watch this film without seeing at least half of the Clone Wars TV show (really you should watch all of it, it's the best thing done after the disaster that were the Prequels), as that was the only way this movie really made sense at some points. Not my favorite movie by a longshot, but definitely fun for someone who doesn't spend all day dredging through the internet wastes of Star Wars debates.","DEC 12, 2022",7,Fantasy

Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker,"Star Wars The Rise of Skywalker: To celebrate May the 4th it’s time to finally review this masterpiece with spoilers. First it’s great to have J.J Abrams back in the directors chair, nothing was wrong with Ryan Johnson but with Abrams it’s a whole different beast entirely. Everything looks great all the effects are outstandingly beautiful, the whole cast is still great but it’s even better to have Harrison Ford come back as Han again I lost it in the theater. But I think the big stand out is Adam Driver aka Kylo Ren he gets so much development in the movie it’s crazy, I went from hating him to loving him. But the big thing is Palpatine and Rey that is something the fan base was not ready for and it was a great. The final battle was the best in the franchise because of all the voices of the fallen Jedi.

The film tries to be a patch on what was seen in the previous film, and tries to maintain a certain respect that in a certain aspect generates an inconsistency with the ideas raised in The Last Jedi. Sidious's return does not convince, in addition to the fact that the how and why of his return is not explained. Once again there are recycled scenes. Rey is developed in a worse way than in the previous films apart from the forced and vague plow twist relating her to Palpatine. On the other hand, Kylo Ren seems to me to have been better portrayed in this movie and is the most interesting thing in the entire film.

Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker,"Star Wars: Episode IX is the first movie I learnt of with my senses and knowledge of Star Wars intact. Just before this movie was coming I watched all the previous movies so that I could catch up before this movie came. I wasn't born until The Phantom Menace, I didn't know anything about the other movies since I used to think Star Wars is only a cartoon, then when The Force Awakens came I had my board exams going on. And The Last Jedi was getting so much hate I thought Star Wars is just another franchise being done to death like Jurassic Park or The Matrix. So overall saying, this is the first Star Wars movie that I knew how to react on when it released. And that was definitely not a good reaction. So first of all my problem is with how ""convenient"" the plot twists are. How on earth are the plot twists done so badly that there doesn't seem to be anything at stake! Rey and friends are getting **** in sand, the animal inside is friendly. C3PO's memory gets formatted, R2D2 restores it. They don't know where to go, Rey just holds her knife and COMPARES IT WITH THE SURROUNDINGS AND FINDS HER WAY!?! And no, I'm not even getting to the dozen things that happened when she had to defeat Palpatine. Nothing matters in this movie for that matter. What happened to Rey becoming evil? What happened to the rebels on the planet where C3PO's memory was formatted? They were never brought up again. The movie completely massacred everything that Star Wars stands for. I think the problem with all the sequel movies is that they are pandering to a much, much younger generation. Anything that could have been a little too mature was probably thrown out of the window by Mickey Mouse, because then how will the little girls from Middle East have Rey dolls if she did something mature like Luke and Anakin? Palpatine came back to life only so that Rey could smash him again and show how strong and smart she is. Ben Solo died only because he was trying to save Rey for some reason, even though he has Jedi powers so he could have just moved her out of the path. No culture, lifestyle, important character, backstory - nothing happened in here. It was just picking up on the disaster that Episode VIII was. And the worst part in the entire movie was when Rey took, or rather should I say, STOLE the Skywalker surname. What even was that scene? The way Luke and Leia were standing in the sky, they looked like her parents. The second worst for me would be the Rey and Ben kissing scene. I don't know how to say this, but Rey has a very sister-like look to her. Why would Ben ever do that? But of course, not everything is bad about Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Palpatine. Like I said before, it has a really awesome CGI, probably the best in the entire Star Wars franchise. The cinematography was also very good. The background score added to the intensity. And the best part - it's the last movie of the sequel trilogy. Finally this thing ended. We don't have to watch any more of Rey Palpatine anymore. I'm glad I've watched every single Star Wars movie now, so I have been able to catch up with the trend and now I can talk to anyone about Star Wars whenever the topic comes up.","JUL 5, 2021",6,Fantasy

However I went into The Rise Of Skywalker with a bit of a small expectation. I knew the movie was not going to be fantastic but the way this movie was advertised as the ""Finale to the Skywalker Saga"" gave me somewhat a BIT of hope. Instead, What I feel we got was two separate movies rolled together into one. The first half seemed to be ""Damage Control"" to the previous movie (By this I mean trying to fix what people were not happy about) and the second half felt more like a rush to get to the end. It is a shame because so many people are invested into this story as they have fond memories of it from childhood. That's not to say the movie is terrible as I don't think it is but it is easily the worst in the sequel trilogy (In my opinion) It felt like there was no main story flowing through these movies but instead different ideas just thrown in together and putting the ""Star Wars"" Name on it to make some money.","MAR 14, 2021",5,Fantasy

I'll give it credit for some visual sequences that dispel cinematic wonder and a tone that J.J.

Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker,"A film all in all beautiful but disappointing if you look at the rest of the saga. There are enough moments of action and twists throughout the film but there are too many letes that almost fall asleep, then it's all very repetitive and most things seem already seen and others don't really have their heads.

Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker,"Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy where do I begin? This is a terrible movie somehow I rated Matrix Revolutions higher than this. Let's get started: 1) Palpatine What was the point in bringing him back, no explanation except: Somehow Palpatine returned. That is actually a line of dialogue in the movie. 2) Retconing TLJ Now I absolutely loved TLJ and Rian Johnson direction with the franchise and we get no explanation why it is no longer canon it just is by the time the film begins. Everything in TLJ is just thrown away for the sake of crybaby fanboys who didn't like Luke in TLJ and a whole mess of fan service. 3) Kylo Ren TLJ gave us an amazing arc for Kylo Ren killing Snoke off proclaiming he's done with having a master, becoming free from any judgment by an authority figure was all great and what do they decide to do with that storyline? NOTHING, absolutely nothing. His master is now Palpatine all the story built from TLJ is all gone! 4) Fan Service Earlier I said that this film was full of unnecessary Fan Service, let's get started: -Luke's character in TLJ is gone -The Death Star is somehow in great shape -Han is back -Lando is back with no explanation -TLJ is gone from Canon (Biggest fan service of them all) -Rey is a Skywalker -And a whole lot more 5) The Ending At the end of the movie Rey goes back to Tatooine where Luke and Anakin were raised with Anakin/Luke and Leia's lightsaber in her hand and buries the lightsabers IN THE SAND that's right she buries the lightsabers in the SAND on the planet that they hated in the thing Anakin hated the most! Basically Rey gave a middle finger to Anakin and Luke and then she says she is a Skywalker!!! WTH!!! 6) J J Abrams Oh man J J Abrams one of my favorite directors (I'm being sarcastic) the man single handedly destroyed the two biggest space franchises in just 10 years. 10 YEARS!! That's got to be a world record. 7) This is the ending to Star Wars Return of the Jedi was a triumphant ending to the original trilogy and 6 film saga, sure it fell short on The Empire Strikes Back but it still was a good film this however is a frustrating and terrible ending to a 40 Year franchise. There is no payoff at the end and it ultimately feels like a Disney crapped in the franchise right before our eyes.

Whether due to his own lack of imagination, studio meddling, or the abomination that Rian Johnson directed, JJ Abrams has wholly and utterly failed to deliver a satisfying end to this abysmal trilogy. The storyline is infantile and nonsensical, the writing itself is hamfisted, and the climax is a laughable double ex-machina.

Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker,"The Star Wars franchise has been a beloved cultural icon for decades, with its epic space battles, iconic characters, and timeless storytelling. However, the latest installment, ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,"" falls far short of expectations and fails to capture the magic of the previous films. The film's plot is convoluted and disjointed, with unnecessary subplots that add little to the overall story. The pacing is uneven, with action sequences that feel rushed and dialogue scenes that drag on for far too long. The film tries to cram in too many characters and storylines, leaving many of them underdeveloped and ultimately unsatisfying. Moreover, the film's attempts at fan service are heavy-handed and feel forced, with callbacks to previous films that feel out of place and unnecessary. The film also fails to deliver on its promise of a satisfying conclusion to the Skywalker saga, with a resolution that feels rushed and unsatisfying. Additionally, the performances of the cast, including franchise veterans like Daisy Ridley and Adam Driver, feel wooden and uninspired, with little chemistry between characters. Even the iconic score by composer John Williams fails to capture the excitement and wonder of the previous films. Overall, ""Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker"" is a disappointing conclusion to a beloved franchise, failing to deliver on its promise of a satisfying conclusion and feeling like a cheap imitation of the previous films. Fans of the series are better off revisiting the original trilogy than wasting their time with this lackluster installment.","MAR 31, 2023",2,Fantasy

Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker,"The best part of The Last Jedi was Kylo Ren's apparent ascent into the role of main antagonist, subverting his original role as the Darth Vader to Snoke's Palpatine. However, apparently, after that film's very divisive reaction among fans, Disney decided to completely reverse course and fall back into the ""original trilogy rehash"" tactic they used to make The Force Awakens. The result is an extremely awkward finale that spends much time poorly retconning virtually every plot development from its predecessor, while also frantically to fit the existing plotline into a mimic of Return of the Jedi. It'd be petty to not at least mention that the CGI is unsurprisingly up to Disney standards, and at least adds some eye-candy enjoyment to the battle scenes and the like. However, overall, the movie feels like an underwhelming finale to a trilogy completely different than the one actually released. The Rise of Skywalker is not just a bad finale, or a bad sequel.

The acting is very well done, but the visual effects are a little overwhelming here and there. Another thing that annoyed me while watching is that the script paints the magic and the spells to be way more elaborate and way more advanced than the magic depicted in the Harry Potter series, which is supposed to take place around 60 years later.

Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,"Another one of those that critics got wrong. Superior to FBAWTFT that I love. This is a much denser, different and complex film. It moves fast (I guess too fast for some), paced like a thriller as Yates and Heyman said, it's frequently magical and awe inspiring. I was in from the very first shot (fantastic opening set piece by the way). Wasn't bothered or didn't see any of the flaws cited by some. It seems fairly obvious that quite a few elements in there will be lost on non fans, but really, why would you see this film if you're not a HP fan or at the very least, a fan of Fantastic Beasts & Where To Find Them?! It's gorgeously shot by Phillipe Rousselot, beautifully directed by David Yates as always, impeccably acted (Johnny Depp puts in one of his finest performances to date, Law is superb, some intriguing new additions, and the main cast is as excellent as ever), it's also shocking at times, intriguing, mysterious. I don't care about the naysayers, JK is delivering what she's been wanting to tell for a while, and she does an excellent job at that. It's at times whimsical, magical, gorgeous (Mirror Of Erised scene, Hogwarts), powerful, mesmerizing (the third act). I'm positively elated to see what JK has in store for the next three films and for us to get the full picture as this is after all the middle film, or middle part of a five part story. The ending is indeed jaw dropping and I'm sure that she has all the answers as she's proven before on HP and all will make sense in due time.","DEC 8, 2018",9,Fantasy

Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,"This follow up film features plenty of decent special effects and lots of CGI creatures, as was the case in the original film. I particularly enjoyed the choreographed scenes. The plot is a bit confusing, which didn't entirely surprise me given its a 'wizarding world' (i.e. Harry Potter universe) film and I've never been interested in Harry Potter but I watched it as I enjoyed the first 'Fantastic Beasts' film when I saw it on TV and I also enjoyed this follow up. There's a decent cast present, with Jude Law and Johnny Depp among them, plus of course Eddie Redmayne as Newt Scamander. I enjoyed his performance and found it a quite watchable and indeed entertaining film, even though I can't say I fully followed the ins and outs of every plot aspect but that doesn't always entirely matter. From what I've seen, a lot of people weren't much impressed with this film due to the plot being a bit scatter-brained. This didn't overly bother me, as I say and I did enjoy the special effects, although sometimes its more of an issue, such as with full out action films, if the main plot seems utterly implausible then it can put me off the whole film, though I really enjoyed watching this film. It's a nice enough form of escapism and so I'd recommend it for that purpose, although I'm not sure I'd say its better than the first film, its certainly not bad at all. Its surprisingly engrossing really and the CGI creatures have a real charm to them, so I felt, its just not a film to overly analyse or take especially seriously I suppose. I certainly enjoyed it more than I didn't.","NOV 21, 2021",8,Fantasy
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,"The Harry Potter universe is one of the most lucrative and striking cinematic phenomena ever and has faithful admirers. Personally, I am one of many teens who read all the books and saw all the films but I was very disappointed with “Fantastic Beasts”. However, I decided to watch this film and see if there would be any improvement here. And I'm glad I did. Far from being wonderful, its much better than its predecessor. After the events of the first film, Newt Scamander is sent by Dumbledore to Paris in order to look for Credence, who survived. Also alive and gone missing is the fearsome Gellert Grindelwald, responsible for many deaths and atrocities, committed to starting a war for global dominance in which sorcerers are to dominate non-sorcerers. Its a generally better film than its predecessor, as it has a lighter pace and takes much less time to develop. The story told seems to have gained a logical thread and that's a good thing. The use and appearance of magical creatures was not as intense as in the first film, and this may have helped to focus the film on the story which, until now, was too weak and uninteresting. However, too much creativity is also a problem as some ideas in the plot end up useless. The development of the characters improved and the material given to the actors was certainly better. David Yates did a good job and takes advantage of all his experience, as he directed the most adult and developed films in the Harry Potter franchise. The cast, certainly due to a better script and material to work on, achieved better results. Despite all this, it continues to make unforgivable mistakes. Some sub-plots, sequences and even characters, like Flamel for example, are totally unnecessary. Eddie Redmayne finally manages to give Scamander a certain attitude and leadership, although he is still uncharismatic and boring. Katherine Waterston also improves here. Callum Turner is good, Zoë Kravitz was a good addition to the role of the psychologically complex Leta Lestrange and Jude Law shone as the intelligent and young Dumbledore. Less positive was Dan Fogler, who is no longer as funny as in the first film. If this ends up being compensated by gaining dramatic depth, the film gives a terrible excuse to justify his presence, given that the character had been “obliviated”, that is, had his memories erased at the end of the first film. On the negative side, I would highlight the poor performance of Alison Sudol. It was not her fault but the fact is that her sweet and stupid character stopped being sweet and became just stupid. Finally, we need to talk more about Johnny Depp. If the cameo in the first film achieved to hide what his participation was going to be, this film shows us the greatness of the actor in the role of another fearsome villain, who is not far behind Voldemort in malice and cruelty. The actor is good and brought his character to life in a brilliant way. If everything goes well for Depp in the films that follow, this could become one of the most outstanding characters in his career, who has left us great jobs before. Technically, this is a very visual film, thanks to tons of very high quality CGI, as we would expect in the Harry Potter universe. Cinematography has good colors, a good use of light and dark and clear footage. To add aesthetic quality we have the charm of the Thirties, with its props and clothings. Much of the film is set between London and Paris, with a brief and unnecessary passage through Hogwarts, and the sets, in all these moments, were meticulously done. The soundtrack, by James Newton Howard, is good and epic, but not surprising.","JUN 25, 2020",7,Fantasy

Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,"This movie was definitely more in line with the spirit of where the series is heading-the first Fantastic Beasts was a little fluffy. I liked the tone, I liked the pacing and the backstories. I liked the expositions of new characters. I am super interested to learn more about how Nagini's story will her to being the right hand man of Voldemort. I felt like a couple lines were forced, such as ""Grindelwald doesn't value that which is simple."" I get that it was a recall to what Dumbledore says about Voldemort to Harry, but I felt like there was no motivation for that line since Newt would've had no reason to say this based on Newt's experiences with Grindelwald. There were some interesting things that could potentially set up some plot holes in the Potterverse. And I would say that I am not worried at all, but Cursed Child made plenty of mistakes in terms of plot direction that cheapened or poked holes in the Potterverse. I actually like Grindelwald movie version more than Voldemort movie version (book version is a different story), he seems more sophisticated and his motives more reasonable. Overall, I liked the tone. And felt encouraged by this installment. It seems to be following the Potter series in that it improves with each installment.

Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,"In a matter of characters, J.K. Rowling does very well, leading everyone to want more about their story. By being a very long film, often does not have enough plot to tell, making some pure points curl up for big revelations in the end. The production can repeat the sequence of incredible effects of the first film, but with less ""intensity"". The conflict between Dumbledore and Grindewald is the key point of the film.

Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,"J.K. Rowling is a good writer. What she achieved with Harry Potter was surprising, after all she made many children become interested in reading again. Even for me Harry Potter also meant a lot. His books were among the first ones I read as a kid and I continued with my love for the saga during my adolescence and yes let's say that now as an adult I still enjoy the films. The books are part of my library and I now consume these new films and I repeat; I think she is a good writer. Hardly a great one but her work was solid, however and sadly, there's a serious problem: She's not a screenwriter. Maybe someone made her believe it and the people involved in the production allowed it, but even though the characters of this whole universe belong to her, it's incredibly obvious that she's not a good screenwriter and unfortunately this films suffers because of it. Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald is a film completely devoid of structure. Being a film of little more than two hours long, its plot barely advances a little. Evidently they're trying to extend the story, though perhaps too much. Even getting into trouble with her own mythology. Unlike the previous film, in this one, everything feels pretty lackluster. Everything that made the previous film pleasant is completely absent here. All the events feel hurried and misguided, in addition to leaving almost all situations completely open. The theme is interesting, especially for those who already know more or less where the story is going, but the way in which Rowling builds the events feels neglected and what probably would have worked very well in a novel doesn't translate well to the cinematic language and therefore doesn't work as it should. And also I have to say that the film has two very serious problems. The first has to do with its title. By being called Fantastic Beasts the story has to include them even though they're completely unnecessary. The second one is the level of magic shown in these stories, which is far superior to that seen in the Harry Potter films, with the exception of the battle between Dumbledore and Voldermort in Order of the Phoenix. Voldemort being a more powerful and obscure wizard than Grindelwald, I'm surprised that he could never have done something similar to Grindelwald's final attack in this film. And above all, don't fool yourselves, maybe they're selling us Newt Scamander as the main character of this franchise now but frankly it's quite evident that this story is aimed at building the mythical final duel between Albus Dumbledore and Gellert Grindelwald and especially the ultimate fate of the new key character: Credence, who finally gets to know his true identity at the end of this film. Although it's fair to ask if with the little success this film has had at the box office, Warner will move forward with the five films plan. I really don't know that, although frankly there's no point in making five films if you're only going to be sharing crumbs in each installment until they reach the ending. That's not fair to the fans because it honestly seems a very rude way to take more money out of them with what little is being delivered. I said this because the mystery of this film is poor. The biggest revelation only happens in the last two minutes and everything that goes on until that moment is really not essential, it's not really important, they don't give anything really substantial and that disappointed me a lot because I'm a fan of this universe, but it is what it is. The only reason I gave it a five is for one simple reason; The level of production remains at the very first level. The magic of this magical world created by Warner is still there. You can see that technology has advanced and honestly, the film looks excellent. Only some minor problems in which the green screen is very evident, but beyond that, the visual effects, the costumes, the sets, the music. Everything's excellent in those departments. I cannot complain about that at all. Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald was very regular. It wasn't worth the two year wait. It's definitely the most disappointing film of this franchise so far but I could hardly say that it's the scandalous failure that many people are saying it is. I don't see it that way and I don't believe it, but it's very far from what was promised.","NOV 23, 2018",5,Fantasy
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,J.K Rowling and David Yates still don’t give us much **** reason to why these movies exist. Fans rather have more Potter. The Fantastic Beasts stories have yet to fully get off the ground. Despite a likeable cast and some magical moments. The Crimes of Grindelwald is bit over-stuffed with too many characters and subplots. You also have Rowling annoying fans. By messing with the time line and having some characters introduced way too early. To how she originally wrote them. My main problem is how they used the delightful Queenie though. Having her tempted by the dark side is like Mary Poppins tempted by the dark side. To me that worked least of all. Well that and flashbacks of Dumbledore (Jude Law) and villain Grindelwald (Johnny Depp) looking at each other in lust.

The CGI looks great but it's overdone - you feel as though you're being led from one over the top set piece to the next. I'm not crazy about the Harry Potter universe (unlike the people I went with) so a lot of what went on was very confusing. This isn't the film to see if you're not familiar with the franchise.

The sound design, production, CGI, cinematography is all amazing, as expected, and the actors are on top of their game and give rise to some very likable characters. Not to mention, the opening sequence of this movie is the best in the entire Harry Potter franchise.

This time, I made sure to pay attention to every detail, plot point, ect, and....this movie doesn't make sense in the slightest. Like not even a little.

Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,"“Magic blooms... only in rare souls. Still, we must skulk in shadows. But the old ways serve us no longer.” ‘Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald’ is a muddled sequel/prequel that lacks magic and wonder. The most tedious part is realizing there’s going to be four more of these; something I was once comfortable with. This isn’t the type of story that inspired J.K. Rowling to start writing - no, this is a studio movie asking when the script is done. The biggest crime this movie has ever committed is being boring. Still, not everything is bad… David Yates directing during the action sequences was entertaining and delivers some creative set pieces. I mean, the guy knows how to direct a big budget movie and make it look as good as it does. The production design and costumes are excellent as usual for these type of movies. Eddie Redmayne and Dan Fogler are great once again. I believed they chemistry a lot more than first one. However, the characters themselves don’t suit this type of story, especially Jacob whose brought back without a good reason. I guess that memory wipe spell didn’t work because it only took away bad memories, yet he remembers the first world war - so why did he forget in the first? I wonder if this affects the people of New York as well. Katherine Waterston did the best with the material she was given, which isn’t much as her character is put on autopilot. Jude Law as a youngish Dumbledore is perfect casting. Law’s shape and classy approach to the character makes his presence enthralling; too bad he’s screen time is slim. I’m aware this opinion may spark disagreement, but I thought Johnny Depp played Grindelwald with the right charm and dangerous presence for the character to work. While I still believe Colin Farrell would’ve been perfect as this series Voldemort, because I could imagine Farrell growing into that wicked and striking villain. And that’s really it for positives. I gave the first movie credit for avoiding nostalgia and managing to stand on its own two feet, but now it’s trying to build a franchise without telling a good story. The movie is all over the place in terms of storytelling and narrative. I’m not sure about you, but I was struggling to follow what was going on. I thought it was just me at first as I don’t consider myself a fan of the series or know the Wizarding World that well. It was meant for the fans who can easily follow this narrative, right? Well, to my surprise and relief, I was wrong. It’s never a good sign when hardcore fans struggle to explain the entire “plot”. Is it about Newt Scamander? How about Grindelwald? Some of the visual effects looked pretty bad and painfully noticeable when interacting with non-digital performers. I said this once and I’ll say it again, I kinda wish there was more practical work. Overall rating: I don’t know the fate of these movie in the future, but judging on the box office results and the critical reviews from both critics and fans alike, it’s pretty bleak. I’m sure there will be a third movie and fans will see it no matter what while holding a grudge against Rowling. What a time to be alive.","DEC 19, 2018",4,Fantasy
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,"I am a decent HP fan. Not the biggest of fan boys but I definitely have a lot of respect for the series and only want to see it presented in the best light. In my opinion this movie while beautifully done lacked in its ability to develop and present a fluid story. To keep things simple here's what I enjoyed about the film. First this film didn't focus too heavily on the magical creatures like it did in the previous installment. I felt like the first movie relied much to heavily on cute/weird creatures to give a reason of interest to the audience. This time around a decently clear story line was first presented with showing Grindelwald and him being the bad guy. I loved the sets and visuals as well as the characters who were all fairly interesting. Ok... so now the bad. It seems like who ever wrote the script said to hell with a coherent story, lets fill this piece of crap up with as much convoluted story material as possible. Even the beautiful scenery and interesting places the characters go cannot distract one from constantly wondering where did such and such come from or how did she or he get here? Why are the characters here? so on and so forth.. Weird sub plots and characters popping in and out made watching this movie extremely difficult to watch at times. One example is Comma's eye parasite or whatever. The movie clearly eludes to him having some sort of problem with his **** cool. As the story goes on we see him mess with it and take eye drops and such. It finally comes down to him passing out randomly and the main characters pull some squigly creature out of his eye. This part has no meaning to the movie as a whole and I was personally left wondering how did he get the parasite why did they put so much effort in showing us all this information?This is just one example where you're left scratching your head wondering what was the point. I can name 3 other parts of the film with the same head scratching confusion as this example. In summary just wait till the movie hits red box. Its worth renting not paying a crazy movie ticket price to view.","NOV 19, 2018",6,Fantasy
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,"Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Yates and Rowling. The fantasy cosmos the whole world fell in love with is back under the title ""Wizarding World,"" this time around no Potter included. Mr. Newton Artemis Fido ""Newt"" Scamander takes up the torch, a famed Magizoologist known for being expelled from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, his gorgeous and naughty creatures and his duty to helm supposedly five entries. Directed by well-known filmmaker David Yates and written by the author herself behind the books, ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" arrived in theaters two years ago, cooking a spin-off/prequel franchise up that got more positive than negative opinions among the stern fandom. Enjoying acceptable box office numbers both domestic and overseas and mostly positive critical reception thanks to the modest-yet-charming performance of Academy Award-winning Eddie Redmayne, wonderfully crafted visual effects, the unexplored pre-Hogwarts world, the fabulous titular beasts and mythical creatures, an enticing plot twist and the delightful journey across New York; ""FBWFT"" was a pleasant and far-seeing surprise that shocked us sooner rather than later. ""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald"" is the second extension set in this long-running sub-Potterverse, directed by the same director of the last four films in the original saga and penned by prolific writer J. K. Rowling. A bolt from the blue is that even with the creative backbone almost untouched, this second part happens to be a pyrotechnic and enjoyable misfire, plenty of deficiently unified sub-plots that ultimately saturate the not-so-eye-popping visual spectacle, introducing untidily so many narrative threads that, instead of complexity, utterly erode the core story. Admittedly the dark beauty of some gigantic, messy set-pieces works not quite right because of the writing individuality, but still, by composition, they're simply bracing, as ever. Philippe Rousselot also returns as director of photography, which benefits visual cohesion as for the franchise' look and tone even when the action moves from America to Europe, mainly to Paris, France. Some shots really work, others shine, but none of them are part of the confusingly edited, overextended, strange action sequences. As usual, imagery is rich in content, not as cozy, universal and relatable as the previous ones, but at least it's impressively appealing. The titular 'fantastic' adjective is tailor-made for these beasts. The two adorable creatures who stole the show last time come back in order to edge into the spotlight with their naive behavior and mini-treatments; but it's Europe which hypnotizes with engaging animals. The Circus Arcanus holds important gears for the plot, so when madness is unleashed in the Parisian streets, it showcases a range of magnificently designed creatures who take over the screen, and therefore, the audience. Newt's traveling zoo/suitcase gives us short glimpses of unexplored habitats, in which the most prominent feature is a visually overwhelming underwater seaweed-seahorse. They monopolize a large part of the long title, but their greater and short splendor takes place only in the first act in visual terms, as story-wise, the greatest trick comes up. Rowling's widely known for erecting fantasy worlds brimming with mythos, facing good against evil, going through an ambiguous area of grays which create beautiful, knotty stories. The primary thread here is clear and synthetic, but to strengthen it and nourish it she draws upon clumsy narrative saturation that ends up throwing an all-star cast, a few engrossing performances and some gloomy digital effects out. The script has no focus to unfold, its ambition to put too much information into a single two-hour-plus feature is atrocious; Dumbledore's true origins are only tested by giving more plot weight to Jacob Kowalski's love affair, mitigate the prominence of the beasts and deliver a worthy development to its great villain are some of the sins that neither the strongest cinematic spell achieves to break. This is a perplexing mythological disaster of endless derivations that, without the talented central figure, would have been the longest headache of this year at the movies. ""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald"" by David Yates mesmerizes us with gorgeous beasts, good performances and special re-encounters with characters from the original franchise; but a hodgepodge of overlong, untidy plots doesn't enrich the main world as it should, instead, weakens and endangers this new franchise of dissimilar entries. ""The Crimes of Grindelwald"" loses its magic, is darker and more tedious than its predecessor, a longueur which tries to provide emotion and thrill with wrongly placed provocative twists that the only thing they achieve is to sink progressively this magical world which is lost in a mess of sequels, spin-offs, homages and Hollywood rip-offs.","DEC 30, 2018",5,Fantasy

Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,"As a fairly casual HP fan, I didn't like this. I spent the first 2/3 or so of the film more or less just confused as to what was going on. Sometimes I'd remember names from books I'd read a long time ago, but I read them long enough ago that I really lost track of which side-characters were who. FB is filmed well, and has its twists and turns, but it does nothing in the way of filling in any of this background. If you're a serious fan and don't need these details spelled out, that's probably just fine. But for a light fan or someone just stepping into a movie on it's own merits with no previous exposure, that's a fatal flaw. I literally spent most of the time munching tasty popcorn, staring at fantastic beasts, and being generally confused. Moreover, while there was a pretty severe lack of exposition as mentioned above, I really felt that the pace of this movie dragged - even with it only coming in just over two hours. I'm honestly not sure what was done with most of this time. It wasn't overly exciting, and it wasn't overly informative exposition. The pacing really wasn't there.

Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,"The movie is very boring. It feels like the first 90% of the movie is one big first act and it ads a atrociously bad plot twist at the end of the movie along with a battle scene that feels like it should be in the middle of the movie. None of the characters feel like in the last movie, there are a lot of unnecessary sub-plots that go nowhere and there are too many characters. Also the tone of the movie is all over the place. In one scene you have Grindelwald killing an entire family, while in the other you have Newt playing with his creatures. The only praise I can give to this movie is the acting. Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald fails not only as a Harry Potter movie, but as a movie in general.","NOV 15, 2019",1,Fantasy
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,"Crimes of Grindlewald is an objectively bad film, and I know how much people hate when you claim a movie is objectively bad. This one is. Fact - The film has many abrupt jumps where characters will be in one place, and suddenly deep into the story in another, so clearly there was a longer edit of the film and a massive chunk was badly edited out. Non-spoiler: Characters are being chased in a library in a big action scene, hard cut, the same characters are all deep into a giant exposition dump inside a crypt. How did they get here? What's with the change in tone? The directly clearly hopes you'll shut up and eat your popcorn. Fact - This film contradicts its own canon. A character in the first film literally explodes and is absolutely certainly dead, and the start of this film handwaves that character as still being alive. If death doesn't matter anymore in this movie, I don't care about any of the conflict. A character just caught fire and fell to dust? For all I know they're coming back in the next movie. Who cares? Fact - The plot has some the biggest leaps in logic of any Harry Potter movie, bordering on incoherent script writing. In one scene it's explained that an important character actually died a long time ago - but wait - that character was accidentally mistaken for an even more important character. They have to leap through a bunch of hoops as to how this character's whole backstory was an insane, crazy coincidence - in order to introduce an even bigger coincidence on top of that! The big reveal is convoluted at best, and when it's explained poorly as it is here, it's just bad. Fact - JK Rowling is going insane. Dumbledore is **** for no reason. I say ""for no reason"" here because the film is constantly telling you that characters are in love, and that being in love is their motivation for doing something. That's not interesting storytelling, that's just bad writing. Why is Dumbledore not fighting the bad guy? He's **** for him. Why is the hero going after a girl? He wants to bone her. Why is the fat guy chasing the blonde lady? He wants to bone her. Why is the asian lady hanging out with the freak? They seem to be sexually attracted. It's basically safe to assume the only reason anyone gets off their ass in this universe is that they're horny. It's dumb. Fact - No seriously JK Rowling is insane. The whole plot hinges on Grindlewald telling wizards that they're being persecuted by the Ministry of Magic, not being allowed to marry muggles and so forth. Except he also wants only pureblood wizards to rule the world. So muggles have to be removed from power, but it's also cool if you marry them? That seems weird, but fine. So Gindlewald's whole argument rests on wizards being afraid of the terrible ""aurors"" - basically cops who kill bad wizards. He specifically says it's important wizards understand he's not the violent one. So how does he show he's non-violent? In literally the scene after that argument, he tries to destroy the world. What in the everliving hell is this terrible writing!? How would his followers not be mad that he's trying to murder tons of people - including wizards - when that is literally exactly the sort of behavior he's using to turn them to his side!? It's like listening to an actual insane person trying to explain political conspiracies to you.","JUN 16, 2019",0,Fantasy
Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,"As a huge Harry Potter Wizarding World fan I am very disappointed in this movie. It doesn`t possess the charm of the original, the actors are taking themselves waaay to seriously, Grindelwald played by J.D is too mild. Dumbledore played by J.L is like a completely different person than who we got to know in Harry Potter. He is very serious, muggle-fashionable pretty boy that has no charizma whatsoever. I didn`t think Jude Law was gonna bring Dumbledore, and he didn`t. Dear makers of this movie: You can`t cast an actor just because he has piercing blue eyes!!!! Cast an appropriate actor that can bring the characte r and put some contact lenses into his eyes for pete`s sake! And the fashion. Why are the wizards and witches fashionable? The Harry Potter books talk about how the magical people clearly don`t get muggle clothing and they cannot blend in. The first original movies showed this beautifully, with fantastic and exciting costume design. How come in the Fantastic Beasts movies they do not wear robes and hats anymore? Where are the robes and hats??? The story line is a mess, I have absolutely no idea what it was about. This movie is cleary just a money maker, and as a fan of her I have to say, J. K. Rowling should be ashamed of herself for selling out like this.","DEC 6, 2018",2,Fantasy

Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,"The Fantastic Beasts series may be the best example since Annie Hall of a film with the biggest disconnect between the values of its fans and its producers including the (living proof that people do not always improve with prior experience) JK Rowling. It continues a long and confusing annual tradition of the casting of a domestic abuser, found $7 million dollars guilty of beating up his wife, in roles that are a little too on the nose. In case you’re looking for a modicum of bravery and decency in the world, check out Amber Heard’s open letter from after she first filed from divorce from her abuser, which she reread recently at a conference. These are reasons enough to make sure that you do everything you can to avoid paying for this film–stream it illegally, borrow it from your friends, burn yourself a DVD from the library, sneak into the theater after having paid to see Ralph Breaks the Internet (read: my Saturday two weeks ago). With all those caveats, and with the understanding that we will be among the first to dance on that man’s grave when his decisions catch up to him, FB: CoG was kind of a snore, but a dark, brooding snore. Someone has written about the unfortunate trope of lazy storytelling by way of magical slide presentations (with respect to Ego in Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy 2), but after an hour of sleuthing, I can’t find it. So if you find anything that attests to this, send it my way. In the meantime, FB: CoG oftentimes feels novelistic to a fault. Some examples: the way that Leda and her brother argue in the crypt about Credence’s identity is infuriating, because unlike with the convoluted, Shakespearean plot reveals of the HP series, the audience here has not had time to work through the intricacies of the plot reveal ahead of time. The reveal doesn’t have its desired effect of shock and pathos, instead it’s pretty frustrating to listen to these two minor characters quibble over something that happened decades ago, which we don’t have the ability to adjudicate or verify (**** style) to a satisfying end. (Friend brought up the weirdness of how these epic figures from the HP universe are all really invested in nobody C-listers, quoting a reddit post: “Turning Eddie Redmayne, Jude Law and Johnny Depp into side characters for a weird Zoe Kravitz/Ezra Miller family drama was a mistake.”) Ditto the loose end of the murdered house elf scene. Ditto the MacGuffin in the PO Box that basically serves as a magic slide presentation of Leda’s family tree. Ditto Grindelwald snorting an old skull and vomiting WWII. The abundance of magical powerpoints is a real weakness to the momentum of the story. That being said, CoG does move the ball further down the field. It’s a film that seems to have kept up with the age of its fanbase and is likely flying over the heads of a lot of its younger viewers: infanticide, ****, holocaust abound. We are looking at a (blinkered but) fuller picture of the Wizarding World outside of school and the effete world of Quidditch, Gringotts, and the Ministry. One of my favorite aspects of storytelling is the lack of logical coherence of Grindelwald’s philosophy. Grindelwald is not just an earlier Voldemort. He’s not the Morgoth before Sauron. He’s not rhetorically opposed to mixed marriages of wizards and non-magic peoples. He’s nominally opposed to police brutality and the horrors of war. His laissez-faire attitude toward most of the hot button social issues of the HP series makes him a lot more insidious a villain, because it’s not entirely clear what his Evil Plan actually is. Whereas the last movie was about stunted desire, CoG takes on more taboo subjects and makes the investigation and the struggle to understand those taboos central to the story, which maybe isn’t the same thing as making an exciting movie necessarily.","OCT 11, 2019",2,Fantasy

The Dark Tower,"Cinema as mythmaking 101, pay attention. What we have here is a christian and/or metaphysical myth of a LIGHT Tower, A Tower of LIGHT, which keeps the world of waking human beings--and similar worlds--coherent and protected from an outer universe it perceives as monstrous and demonic. Thats one myth-archetype. Next myth is a TV Western gunslinger written only two-dimensionally but brought to life by Idris Elba. That's two myths-archetypes. Next is the Satan-Devil figure, given the 2D writing, done as well as I think Marvel could do him in Matthew's fine performance. That's three myths-archetypes. Then we have the boy-coming-of-age myth, Heroes Journey myth and common sub-myths and tropes. Tried and true mythmaking is what critics get awfully tired of. However, the audience I saw it with cheered and clearly several were seeing it at least a second time. Mythmaking done well is always a crowd pleaser. I liked it. Why? It's done with conviction. Not often do we see a POSITIVE LIGHT Tower as a mythic element in a script. Compare with LOTRings where all the towers and mountains are negative downers. The LOTR Elf kingdom is more hospitable but plays only a minor role. Could this be extended into a series on TV, on film? Hard to say. From skimming the Wikipedia article on the book series, I think making it a young adult film makes more sense than a literal translation of book plot to filmed script. However the film makes little to no attempt to suggest where a sequel to the movie might go. It may be myself and only a few other esoteric-Christian mystics who see in this Dark Tower a LIGHT Tower.","SEP 3, 2017",9,Fantasy

The Dark Tower,"I was originally excited to see this movie when the 1st trailer came out... I hadn't read the books but researched the concepts for the film, getting a general idea of the overarching story. When all the buzz seemed to indicate the movie was a disappointment, I elected to see the film anyway and kept an open mind. If nothing else I'd probably like the leading actors' performance and would see some cool cinematography. The rest of the folks in the theater that saw The Dark Tower with me I think all felt the same way: 'this isn't getting a great buzz, but let's see what it has to offer'. The Dark Tower gives us a glimpse into a gritty reality, one that ties into visually fantastic worlds and concepts, and portrays characters that were interesting and intriguing; characters you end up liking and if anything, you want to see more of what they have to offer. The movie makes me WANT to read the books; I’m not a filmmaker/film critic/in the film industry, but I would venture a guess that the intended outcome of this film was to get folks interested in the series and for me they succeeded. The film has a ""young"" director; Nikolaj Arcel has not made that many movies from what I can tell, and this I think shows: if you are looking for flaws in this film you WILL find them… I suppose I’m just willing to forgive the occasional flaw for the sake of having a good time. We live in a day and age where people want to find things to be upset about, sadly enough. I liked The Dark Tower; it was fun, visually impressive, and only once or twice did its film-making flaws really feel apparent enough to distract. I walked away from this film enjoying the overall movie-going experience.

I knew this movie would never live up to the books, but the movie actually incorporates more of the material then I would've though possible for a 95 minute movie. The story was good, not perfect, but good considering how much material they had to condense to make one movie explain what is going on. The story was a different perspective on the material that and works well as an introduction to The Dark Tower universe. I thought Mcconaughey was effective as the man in black, I still have reservations about Elba playing Roland, but it wasn't bad. All together the movie didn't let me down, and re-enforced the idea that I want to see more of this universe on the screen.

The Dark Tower,"Based on the bestselling book series by highly acclaimed author Stephen King, The last Gunslinger, Roland(Idris Elba), has been locked in an eternal battle with the Man in Black (Matthew McConaughey), determined to prevent him from toppling the Dark Tower, which hold the universe together. With the fate of the worlds at stake, good and evil will collide in the epic battle as only Roland can defend the Tower from the Man in Black. -- I begun watching this with mixed expectation. Was a bit disappointed to see yet film based on 'kids'. That alone makes it hard to take the film seriously. It's a fact there is a limit to how well kids can act compared to full fletched young adult or adult actors/actresses. The ideas and concepts are good. Though not exactly original, with respect to demons eyeing to dominate human world. They still make a good general concept for a good story. However the idea that kids' minds (after being strapped to machines) can be used to destroy the tower, is a really silly concept. I generally like the film as I was watching it. The pacing is alright. Actions are well choreographed. The plots lack depth, and have the problem of being kinda predictable. Characters are all underdeveloped for the most part, except for Roland where the film shows some key aspects of his past. The villain (Man in Black) is pretty cool and ruthless, and have some nice abilities, most notably the ability to command any human to do what he commanded at will, with a simple spoken command. It would be nice if the film delve deeper into his background character and his past. If you like The Mortal Instruments (film), give this a watch.

The Dark Tower,"The Dark Tower is nowhere near as bad as the critics and fans are making it out to be. Despite the trailers making this look like a straight up action film with bad dialogue, it is in fact a fantasy story containing acting and directing so good that you will forget the script's sometimes lackluster lines. Good actors can make a bad line disappear, and these actors do just that. It's very loosely based on the books, and is considered a continuation rather than an adaptation. The movie centers around a psychic boy named Jake, a cowboy-knight named Roland, an evil Man In Black named Walter, and a Dark Tower that holds the universe together by keeping monsters out. The Man In Black wishes to destroy the Tower so he can rule a chaotic universe. He needs Jake to destroy the tower. Jake needs to find Roland to save him from the Man In Black. Roland seeks the Man In Black for revenge. Each character pursues another, and around and around they go. The movie does a better job of laying the groundwork than the first book in the series, in many regards. Of course, the first book is notoriously confusing. Just like the first book, 3 of the main characters have been left out. This non-departure from the source material helps to facilitate a digestable entrypoint for newcomers. Idris Elba is wonderful as Roland. Some people argue he does not fit the description of Roland in the book, and they would be right. Roland is described as an ugly Clint Eastwood/Steven King look alike, who appears emaciated and ancient beyond belief. Mr. Elba is none of these things. However, he understands how to convey all the necessary aspects of the character. He is full of grit and grump, beleaguered, yet heroic. His performance has convinced many a skeptic to sing his praises, with good cause. Tom Taylor plays an excellent Jake. He fully embodies the worry of a troubled boy who may be going insane, but also the innocence and excitement of someone finding a portal to another world. Child actors often get a well-deserved bad rap, but Tom Taylor delivers every line perfectly. Matthew Mcconaughey was really and truly awful as The Man In Black despite having come so far as an actor and playing such wonderful roles in the last few years. As an all powerful wizard, he was neither intimidating nor believable, opting for an over-the-top take on the character that just doesn't work. It's understandable why he went that route. The rest of the movie allows for, and even encourages, over-the-top at times. However, that was the greatest weakness of the film, and Mcconaughey's performance is the embodiment of that weakness. The score varied from average to well-above average, rarely grabbing your attention, but always fueling the emotions on screen. The cinematography, particularly of the first two thirds, is some of the best in years. Praise should also be cast on the editing. Contrary to the cut-per-milisecond style that has become ever so popular in modern movies--and especially action scenes--The Dark Tower does not fear lingering on a beautiful scene and letting you soak in it, or staying with a character as we see emotions fully processed through their face and body. It's as if the editor knew that they didn't need to cut haphazardly to instill a false sense of excitement, or to cut away from a less than genuine performance. They trusted the story, visuals, and acting to hold our attention, and that faith was well placed. At least, it was well placed for the first two thirds, before falling into so-so territory by the last third. The movie should also be praised for doing with $60 million what many others fail to do with $120 milliom. I'm looking at you Assassin's Creed. The ambition of this project far surpasses others, despite the budgetary constraints. The humour peppered here and there was phenominal as well. Marvel has the jarring idea lately that they should throw humour into every nook and cranny possible, hoping the 15 good jokes make up for the 15 that fell flat. No such philosophy is necessary here. For the first time in years, I felt like every joke worked. None of it felt forced. Of course, the movie had its problems. The tone should have been dark. It was too over-the-top for its own good. It added the strange element of futuristic technology that was completely absent in the books, and the technology was overdone in the style of bad science fiction. The costuming department seemed to think they were making a new Matrix movie, instead of the dusty cowboy/fantasty it should have been. It wasn't a great movie, but considering the source material is known for being unfilmable, it's a shock they made a coherent movie at all. I have newfound confidence that they can learn from the mistakes of this film and make a truly great second installment. Hopefully they do, so we may meet the other three main characters (yes, Oy the talking dog counts!), hear some ZZ Top backbeat, and maybe even meet Blaine the Train.","AUG 7, 2017",7,Fantasy

Hence, interpreting is still possible a little different. For an unknowing viewer, the film will indeed be terrible. To the knower is incomparable. The only nuance: the merged final battle. Just a break in the film. For this huge minus.","AUG 3, 2017",8,Fantasy
The Dark Tower,Looking at the many negative reviews I think we can conclude this movie has nothing to do with the books and this is turning off a lot of fans from this series. However out of frustration or disappointment then giving this movie a very negative review does not do it justice. When you can see this movie as a stand alone and look past the books this actually is a very entertaining movie. Idris Elba does a great job as Roland and Tom Taylor is doing potentially even better in my eyes. Overall I enjoyed this movie very much.,"SEP 13, 2020",8,Fantasy
The Dark Tower,"I absolutely loved it. I may be a bit cramped, but the actor play is fantastic, the actors are all cool and play their role wonderfully, action sequences are all how i imagine them to be - dynamic, short and with a couple of tide turns. I really hope to see the sequels.","AUG 11, 2020",10,Fantasy
The Dark Tower,"As someone who hasn't read the King books - and someone who gave up on Marvel movies several years ago - I have absolutely no idea why this film is so maligned in an era where the stock-standard superhero movie reigns so supreme. Nothing here is terribly ""new"", but it's a successful mish-mash of various genres (mostly fantasy and Western) that does what a good blockbuster should: entertain. Furthermore, as someone who hasn't read the King books, I can't say I felt that anything was ""**** I guess it's inevitable that condensing eight beloved books into a single movie is gonna tick SOME people off. As for claims that it's ""incomprehensible"" to newcomers: I'm pretty sure I understood every second of it, no problemo. It's fairly basic stuff, to be sure, but has enough flair to keep one easily engaged for a smidgen over ninety minutes. Methinks you people have gotten just a wee bit spoiled if you find this inadequate; especially given how indiscriminately you all rush off to catch the latest Marvel movie in the cinemas (several times a year, no less)! Oh: and McConaughey's delectable depiction of the villainous Man in Black is simply to die for, and well worth the price of admission alone.","APR 19, 2020",8,Fantasy
The Dark Tower,"Come on. This movie wasn't that bad to have a 4.0 score. Minimum I would give it is a 6/10. Had it's issues, the most glaring of which was that it failed to set up characer backgrounds properly such that if a character died, we feel the impact. I felt nothing when Jake's mom died or even when Walter died. If the emotional impact was felt, the movie could have been an 8 or 9.","OCT 12, 2017",7,Fantasy
The Dark Tower,"Surprised the metascore is so low for this movie. Rented it from Redbox with 0 expectations based on critic reviews. This is not a 34/100 movie. Not great by any means, but competently written, acted, and directed.","NOV 3, 2017",7,Fantasy
The Dark Tower,"The Dark Tower was a good movie. I feel like I’m not allowed to say that unless I explain myself, so here goes: I think this movie should have been called “The Gunslinger” because it was about a gunslinger rescuing a boy from a bad guy. And it does a good job of telling that story. Calling the movie “The Dark Tower” sets up the expectation that the movie will be about the Dark Tower, but its not. We barely see the Dark Tower, and no action whatever takes place there. I think SONY did a very awful job of properly promoting this project, and properly setting the audience’s expectations. It should have been made crystal clear that this was not an attempt to tell the stories from the novels, but rather, an attempt to tell a simple story that will introduce key characters, themes, and mysteries that exist in the Dark Tower universe. It should have been made clear that this was an introduction to this universe, and not the beginning, middle and end of it. It should have been made clear that the characters, themes, and mysteries that were introduced in this movie were not going to be addressed in depth in this film, but instead, will be fleshed out through upcoming TV series and movie sequels. If a person knows all that going in, there is a much better chance that they could just relax and enjoy the show. Unfortunately, and through no fault of their own, the viewers just had no idea what to expect going in, and were turned off by a simple quick storyline, huge themes and mysteries being mentioned and then never addressed again, and feeling like they were JUST getting to know the characters just as the thing ended. I’m super bummed about the bad reviews and the low box office, because now I fear this project will be abandoned… I certainly hope not. But Sony really screwed up.","AUG 9, 2017",10,Fantasy
The Dark Tower,"If you want a scene-by-scene interpretation of the book: forget it. But if (like me) you appreciate the creative translation that is necessary to make a movie work, than you'll be very pleased. Way more engaging, tightly plotted and solidly acted than anything in the book (which was even to King's admission a mess) the movie also boasts a very impressive characterization by Elba and McConaughey while boasting a solid single story (if you don't like open endings) while still allowing for the sequels to be made. Everything about this movie was impressive. Must see.","AUG 23, 2017",9,Fantasy
The Dark Tower,"Too many seriously negative reviews. Let me try to explain, I've read all the books, all 8. This movie is in no way even an adaptation of those books. It is pure Hollywood and is why so many loyal King readers feel their years of waiting for the perfect Dark Tower movie have been cheated and crushed. Especially with the success of Harry Potter and Game of Thrones from book to screen. That being said, this movie is not poorly done. For the budget, they do a great job at bringing a wealth of action and scenery as well as a cast that does a very good job at selling what they've been given. I went with 2 people who have never read the books and both said they enjoyed the film and were now intrigued in the books especially if it is better than what they just watched, which they most certainly are. If you have never read the books, give it a try and don't bother with the negative reviews from fanboys. If you have read the books, understand the perfect Dark Tower movie may never get made and thats OK. Even an average one can bring even more into our universe and have people reading such a fascinating story, which in turn may let to more creative minds than these to develop an even better version.","AUG 10, 2017",7,Fantasy
The Dark Tower,"Having never read the books I cannot compare this film as harshly as the critics have. To me it was a decent action flick, in which Idris Elba does a good job. It felt more like the prologue for a series of indepth movies, but I still respect the effort.","AUG 6, 2017",7,Fantasy
The Dark Tower,"Following in the line of thought that the book is only inspirational for the film, and that this is a new interaction in Roland's search for the Dark Tower, I must say... IT'S AWESOME!!! The only reason I did not give 5 stars for this movie is that I felt it was too short, not better explaining some of the things that are happening in the plot. But probably some of the novel's concepts were left out or only hinted in order to simplify the movie's premise. No harm with that. Given the low ratings, it'll probably won't have a sequel, which is a shame.","AUG 23, 2017",8,Fantasy
The Dark Tower,"Stephen King is probably the most filmed writer. ""The Dark Tower"" — his most famous work. And not without reason. The cycle consists of an eight not small books. They varied in quality, but still dragged them into his world. Rumors about the film adaptation began to circulate in 2007, and ten years later we got a film based on the series of novels. This film everyone was waiting for, because in books there is everything you can love a captivating story: a charismatic protagonist, interesting world, inhabited by different dangers, evil villains, and an interesting mythology of the world. But many fans and sympathizers was suspicious of the film before the premiere. Black Roland, that all sin! Yes, and the film will last only 1.5 hours. Also this film is not the film adaptations of the books of the cycle, and their continuation! This is a controversial step. For fans of the great cash not to do a ""stray"" audience can not understand. But the writers did it! Maybe the fans will complain, they always will be. But for me, as someone who has never read a single book from the series, though, and knows a lot about them, the film exceeded my expectations, which, by the way, was no. Roland — the protagonist of a cycle of novels. Here he plays a talented Idris Elba. Himself Stephen King praised his acting! And even cut some dialogues of Roland, as the Elba, perfectly passed all his facial expressions. I think the Gunslinger could play and Matthew McConaughey, and Idris Elba Man in Black. But we have what we have. Idris Elba has really fine job with the role. Roland is still the same charismatic, and how awesome he is with revolvers! He has his own drama, and not even knowing her backstory from the books, you're still experiencing it with the hero. Matthew McConaughey plays the Man in Black — main villain of the film, which is pumped from the books. Playing McConaughey nice to watch. When he's on screen, it just steals the stage with her charisma. About him the villain we know almost nothing, and he wants to destroy a Dark tower, to rule the world, but thanks to the game McConaughey, he does not seem so flat villain. Roland, though the hero of the books, but not this film. He is one of the main characters. The engine of this movie is the boy Jake, who has the gift of ""the shining"". He foresees things and sees ""the middle world"" is one of the variations of Land where the lives of Roland. The guy behaves heroically, though, and is a small burden to Roland. The movie is 1.5 hours, and we began to forget what it is. Usually blockbusters are now 2 hours or more, and we are already used to this pace. But this timing does not allow the film to sagging in the dynamics. The narrative here is very dynamic and, at times, throws us abruptly from scene to scene. At first it's annoying and it feels like some kind of serial format. But you get used to it. Such dynamics is great for such a simple plot. We have a guy who is being chased by the villain, and a good shot trying to save him and kill the man in black. Everything is simple and without surprises. The series of books was large and there was always a continuation. This film though has the freedom to continue, a complete work. Of course, first and foremost it is perfect for fans of books that finally got really the end. The world of books is varied, but the film didn't show us many of its inhabitants, and in general, feel the lack of budget. The movie ""The Dark Tower "" is not to be confused with the adaptation of another author. Though this film is not an adaptation of the books of the cycle, Stephen King felt here. In the books the dynamics a little, the film is completely dynamic. This is action movie in which the books of Stephen King was almost nothing left. Fans will not be happy, but for people who have not read the book the movie will make a good impression. Yes, Idris Elba is not Clint Eastwood, who Stephen King was inspired by when creating the image by hand but Idris played it well! Before watching the movie don’t have to read the book, which is good. But if you read the whole cycle, you will understand much more. Although, the audience and explain a lot. It is a dynamic, emotional film that will not let you get bored.","AUG 3, 2017",8,Fantasy
The Dark Tower,"Wow,never listen to the critics again. I thought this was a tremendous film. Sometimes I find movies made from books are immediately panned because they don't measure up, which is a warning sign if you don't care because you haven't read the novel or short stories.

The Dark Tower,"The dark force, the dark tower and then there's heroes! Based on the book of the same name. It is a book series, so we can expect a new franchise here. Another fantasy series, but is it worth is the real question. I don't know how famous is the original source, but I did not find the film any good. For me, it was another teen film like the majority of similarly themed films that flopped terribly. But here, an adult holds a prominent role that played by Idris Elba. Maybe this is just an introduction, but still the first impression failed. The youngsters might enjoy it better than the adults. Particularly the teenagers. A teenager having a series of strange dreams about another world is all actually comes true when he enters through a portal to one of those worlds in the same universe. Now he's tailed by a most dangerous force in the universe, but accompanied by a gunslinger, he has to find a way to stop an apocalypse that's going strike his world and to rest of the universe. Being very simple could be the reason I did not enjoy it. Basically, there's no twist in it. What they have called twist was a cliche in this kind of theme. The cast was okay, and so the visuals. But it all points to the story. The sequel could get better, so lets wait and see. In the meantime, I've heard that a completely a new version of the television series is on the development. I hope it works out better than the film franchise. Finally, it is an average film, neither worth nor a waste of time! I hope you make the right decision regarding watching it! 5/10","FEB 3, 2018",5,Fantasy
The Dark Tower,"I honestly don't know how did Matthew and Idris Elba two amazingly great actors ended up performing for such a movie. The story is based on the books, which are quite good, but it just simply doesn't deliver and what was a good plot became a poor story. Acting is pretty good, but that's the only point where I can give it credit. Casual directing style and writing was just average. Visuals pretty messy. So on short this movie is a below average movie, and does nothing special and even messed up the things they could have done a lot better to make the movie better. Simply a waste of talent of the actors.","JUL 7, 2018",4,Fantasy

The Dark Tower,"I was actually surprised by how bad the reviews were for this movie. I'm usually pretty good at guessing Metacritic ratings and thought this would be somewhere in the 60s. It kept my and my wife's interest. I found the action scenes to be reasonably well choreographed and tense, with the exception of the ultimate showdown between the man in black and Roland, which was moderately silly but enjoyable. I read all of the books and thought Idris Alba did a fine job channeling the surly but ultimately sympathetic Roland from the books. The ""fish out of water"" scenes when Roland was in New York were predictable but well executed. The actor who played Jake was capable and unobjectionable. I read all of the books and had a feeling that it would be very difficult to make them into a movie, unless the producers were committed to at least 9 or 10 movies, which isn't realistic. Nevertheless there were aspects of the lore, which they would have done well to incorporate -- for instance, the floating doors/portals, the idea that all things serve the beam, the actual Crimson King and the field of roses surrounding the tower. They made the man in black too much of a caricature to take seriously. To echo other complaints, I felt that the plot was far too rushed. This movie should have been closer to three hours and they needed more build up and back story. Roland's motivation for killing the man in black felt flimsy largely as a result of a poorly staged and executed flashback. The Gunslinger books, for me, are the perfect blend of horror, action, and sci fi. If there's a sequel I'd love for someone with more of an imagination to take a crack at it, like an Aronfsky.","AUG 6, 2017",5,Fantasy
The Dark Tower,"Saw it last night, it wasnt bad. It was mostly okay. Elba and McConaughey were damn good, McConaughey really brought a scary charm to the role. Other than that, it felt condensed and incompletE. It would've helped the script if the movie had only one writer instead two writing teams amounting to a total of five writers, That would have allowed the script to be more focused and have the really good stuff fleshed out. There was also just a lot of points were stuff was obviously cut out, leading to the movie not taking enough chances and quite a few holes. With King, playing it safe usually hurts an adaptation more than it helps.","AUG 9, 2017",6,Fantasy
The Dark Tower,"Three strong central performances and plenty of fan-service carry an otherwise lackluster adaptation of an 8+ book series from Stephen King. Things move at a brisk pace as the movie tries to cram differing material from seven books into roughly an hour and a half, leading to a muddled story that rushes from plot point to plot point when it should be pacing itself and leaving the door open for potential sequels the way the books did. I will say this though, it's faithfulness to the lore of the series did make for a potentially satisfying continuation of The Dark Tower series. It's just that the emphasis on closing Roland's battle with Walter as quickly as possible means that it misses out on the true spirit of the books. The relationship between Roland and Jake is never fleshed out as they barely have a moment to ever sit down and bond. Roland's backstory and the history of Mid-World are also barely touched on. Essentially what I'm trying to say is that the movie delivers a tale that deals with the deeper elements of The Dark Tower series, but simultaneously fails to use them or even talk about them. Something any fan of the books will tell you just isn't possible. The complexities of the story are essential to Roland's quest. Those who have read the series will be able to grasp what's going on, but a lot of newcomers are likely to find themselves lost in regards to anything but the surface conflict of Roland's hunt for Walter. Stylistically the movie is an awkward combination of fantasy and science-fiction. The books were a combination of these two genres, as well as many others, so it's true to form in that regard. It's just not handled all that well here, leaving their union to feel jumbled and perhaps incoherent. At least to anyone who hasn't read through the King books. Everything is beautifully brought to life though. The action scenes themselves are quite impressive and a lot of fun to watch as they show off why Roland is such a force to be reckoned with. Despite it's weaker narrative this adaptation/sequel to The Dark Tower series has plenty of awesome material for longtime Dark Tower fans as well as those who have also enjoyed the larger catalog of King material. It's got a little something from each of the novels in the series, as well as quite a few nods to the larger Stephen King multiverse. The way the movie borrows bits and pieces from all sorts of different areas is sure to prove entertaining to the clued in. The casting is also phenomenal. Idris Elba captures the stoic, cold natured, yet deeply layered and surprisingly human nature of Roland with ease. I just wish he hadn't been given such goofy dialog. Matthew McConaughey is simultaneously menacing and playful. A great Walter/Martin/Randall Flagg/ect. Tom Taylor is the perfect Jake as well as the heart and soul of the film. The scenes and elements that have been adapted here are done quite well. All in all The Dark Tower is an excellently cast film that brings a bunch of material from the books to the big-screen, but fails to bring them all together into a coherent whole. Yet, when all is said and done that which is here is likely to prove a blast for Stephen King's fanbase even if it isn't the truly satisfying adaptation/continuation of his magnum opus that we were all hoping for. It tries to satisfy longtime fans and create some new ones in the process. Ultimately it fails to do either thanks to impenetrable nature of the complex lore and it's flawed attempt at transferring the book's lengthy plot into the film format. Still, there is some good to be found inside.","AUG 18, 2017",6,Fantasy

The Dark Tower,"The Dark Tower is an action movie based on the Stephen King book. It tells the story of The Dark Tower,obviously, which is basicaly the protection of all universe aganist the dark forces,and it´s protected by gunsligers, but THE DARK TOWER can be destroyed using the mind of a kid so a bad guy start to capture kid and put in his crazy machine that starts to detroy THE DARK TOWER, and it only left over only one gunsliger, and we got his drama stuff (that is actualy good) and there is this medium kid that have visions about the Dark Tower and the bad Guy so they go on an epic generic story. If you takes all the sobrenatural stuff this is another action movie so if you`re expecting something awesome and inovator unfortunately this isn`t the movie, and it´s really sad beacause it has potential. One of the Highlits of the movie is the villan, Because he got every thing that you expect of a bad guy he is **** and if you are a little sensive you will hate him (If you like Loki you will love him, really) about the heroes the interaction of then are okay and the actor, actualy the all cast is good. The movie ritm is slow and may be boring but the action scenes are really good, actualy there is one scene that for me it`s the second best action scene tha I ever seen (it only don´t superates that one of the Church, on Kingsman) This is a boring movie with great action scenes that keep you at the universe but not at the story.","DEC 3, 2017",5,Fantasy

The Dark Tower,"I know this IP has previous history, but all I really know is this movie adaptation. The story is centered around a young boy and the movie is rated 12, but it is kind of dark, slow and drab for a kids movie. So I have got to ask who is this movie for? Not one for the kids and not adult enough for the adults. This is universe/reality doesn't seem that well constructed if the mind of a child can bring it all crashing down. Says so in the open credits so no real spoiler, but what a silly premise to build a movie around hey? I get the Gunsmith mythos as it based of an older well known old as time legend due to some bad guys exposition. So that gives the movie a helpful sense of being grounded in the familiar and not feeling totally lost in this universe to what they hell is going on. This is a odd one to rate it wasn't truly bad in any sense, but somehow it feels watered down due to the 12 rating. The Dark Tower simply wasn't dark enough I suppose?","OCT 7, 2018",5,Fantasy

The Dark Tower,"Stephen King's best work, gets a watered down adaption. That feels like the director and screenwriter, both never even read the books. Roland (Idris Elba) in the books is obsessed with getting to the Tower. Here he only cares about revenge on the Man in Black (Matthew McConaughey) who killed his father. While Jake's (Tom Taylor) backstory is a bit tampered with too. I am pretty sure in the book, he got to Roland's world by being shoved in front of a car by a mad man. I am sure Jake being obsessed with drawing Roland and his world is from like the 2nd or 3rd book. The books were quite violent and graphic. With a Western like feel to them. There's not much screenwriter Akiva Goldsman got right. The plot is a incoherent mess that doesn't feel like any of the books. While none of the books are close to PG-13. The best things about this movie is the Idris Elba and Tom Taylor chemistry. As well as the humor of when Roland tries hotdogs or Soda for the first time. McConaughey tries hard to play a cold hearted bastard and succeeds on some levels. Maybe because his character does some evil things. I also liked the mind control scenes. Otherwise I think they needed someone like Willem Dafoe who could play evil in his sleep. All in all, Sony and Akiva Goldsman are where this adaption went wrong. As well as being too short. King's prized possession shouldn't be in the hands of the studio that brought us the Ghostbusters reboot and the Emoji movie. While Goldsman hasn't adapted one book well. The screenwriter of Batman & Robin shouldn't be allowed near anything Stephen King. Especially The Dark Tower. Adapting the Dark Tower, proved he shouldn't have been near it. Dark Tower unfortunately is like the Last Airbender where they tried to fit a whole season into one short movie. Except here it was 7 books in one movie. While the planned series sounds like a mess too when apparently it will skip earlier books and go right into book 5 and a in between book King wrote after book 7. Should have exactly started from book 1 with this movie, it's not that hard.","SEP 27, 2017",6,Fantasy
The Dark Tower,"Adapting a book as complex as The Dark tower series, into a film, is no easy task, and some things just have to be changed in order of making it work. If this was a stand-alone story without any ties to any books, it would be decent, not perfect, but not bad. Because it's not a bad film, the acting isn't bad though there's a severe lack of depth to the cast, Roland stands out as confused, Jake even more so and Walter just pure evil. It's one dimensional, but it works. But I've also read the books, and was expecting so much more, especially since King had talked so much about not wanting this adapted to film, because he care too much about it. The film basically takes the first book and the last book, makes a mash-up and calls it a day. They've completely skipped a LOT that could have been an epic series of films, and they could easily have made 5 2-hour films out of the series and still made good of it. This film needs to be seen as a stand-alone, forget it has anything to do with ""The dark tower"" book series, read the books, see the film, but forget that they have any connections.","AUG 20, 2017",6,Fantasy

Put together, they create a truly compelling setup. Unfortunately, the payoff lands with yawn…or not at all. While there are some interesting visuals and the fights aren't awful, the narrative never takes hold to provide any thrills or surprises.","AUG 3, 2017",4,Fantasy
The Dark Tower,"Quite nice for an sci-fi action movie. Both Bale and Elba played their roles fine. Right, but this is not even close to the one of the most epic book ever written. Single movie, not even 10 movies, likely not even 50 movies could possibly describe that most epic DT universe. That was quite obvious, the book is so great that not even skill of Avatar plus Game of the Thrones creators combined could hardly be enough for DT. I didn't expect anything good, I didn't receive one.","DEC 30, 2017",6,Fantasy
The Dark Tower,"The first thing to understand about the film is that it is not an adaption of The Dark Tower in its entirety, or any of the component books in part. Instead, it is a continuation of the story from the point at which Roland walks out of the Tower in Book 7. True fans looking for a continuation of the story might be rewarded. The rest of the world may be left scratching its collective head. Leaving aside the feeling that the best stuff happened before the film starts, the second thing to understand is that any sense of awe and wonder is undercut by the previews. We’ve seen Roland’s otherworldly (literally) skills, and we’ve seen most of Walter’s magic tricks on Youtube, Apple Trailers, etc. This is a bad thing – what little chance the movie has for awe, wonder, and suspense is blown since we already know what will happen at crucial moments. The best example is when Roland blind-shoots Jake’s would-be captor: the scene is filmed to perfection, but we aren’t on the edge of our seats because it is effectively a re-run. I don’t blame the filmmakers here, but I do blame the preview editors. As for the rest of the film, I’d call it “adequate.” Jake’s earlier scenes are great, but wasted as the troubled-but-visionary character trope gives way to a straight-forward fantasy quest. The vistas are magnificent, but give way to village scenes that look straight out of Costner’s Postman. Walter is evil, but so completely and casually so that we can’t be frightened (and who doesn’t want to destroy a cinematic universe these days? The action is fantastic, but how many other times have we seen someone in a leather duster shoot up a room full of bad guys? The film resolves, but there are a ton of contrived plot devices which cause the movie to skip anything interesting or character-defining (and let’s not forget that one of Steven King’s greatest skills is character development over long periods). As a final (and positive) note, the cast is fantastic. Idris Elba is great as always, Matt McConaughey is silky-smooth, Katheryn Winnick (aka Lagertha of Vikings fame) is nearly perfect, and Lucas Hamilton does a great job of balancing Jake’s psychological “troubles” with a sense of awe and understanding of his destiny. Jackie Earle Haley gives what he has to a throw-away role, as does Claudia Kim. The only weak link is Fran Kranz, whose screen time leaves him without his usual ability to put an indelible stamp on a character. He is woefully underused here, but that’s really the only issue I took with the cast. In the end, I think we deserved a multi-season epic covering the actual books, bringing to life a truly unique fantasy multiverse. I think what we got was something more like a coda: like 1998’s X-Files or Twin Peak’s Fire Walk With Me. Vaguely interesting, but not really satisfying.","AUG 3, 2017",5,Fantasy
The Dark Tower,"The last Gunslinger (Idris Elba) is locked in eternal battle with mysterious Man in Black (Matthew McConaughey), determined to prevent him from toppling the Dark Tower, which holds the universe together. Stephen King has released a lot of books already (most of them fiction), and there’s also a big number of screen adaptations of his work. But this is the first fruitful attempt to bring his „Dark Tower“ saga to the cinemas, which has already disappointed and/or made angry a lot of fans and critics. Controversy was to be expected. King himself and many of his admirers find „Dark Tower“ series his crowning achievement and magnum opus, so there was probably never going to be a way to adapt even part of the eight novels into a movie. At least not in a way that would satisfy both constant readers and those who just came to see a sci-fi/action movie alike. The project was in pre-production hell for quite some time and the various parties had several different approaches to make it all happen. I am not sure what was the motivation behind using the script that they finally used, but to call this a „Dark Tower“ adaptation, or even King adaptation, is kind of stretching it. What they did was to take some elements of the whole big DT mythos, including three of the major characters, and then change it whatever the hell way they wanted. I am not against remixing King per se, and some new things are pretty cool to see on the screen at last – concentration camp for „shining“ children“ and the mentioning of Keystone Earth, for example. But the new story, which is replacing King’s stories, is underwhelmingly shallow to say the least. In 94 minutes, there’s no room on any world, story, character and relationships building that King has famous for. Most of the events happen and pass fast, just because it is supposed to happen, not that it develops organically from what has come before. It’s not a satisfying solution, not for King lovers, not on its own. The only good thing I have to say about the screenplay is that you can follow it without having read any of the King’s work. But then again, it also makes the ending too definite and clear-cut which was never the aim of the series. Matthew McConaughey is good too, ruthless and menacing, although they have changed his character in ways that I don’t quite like, making him kind of boring. If the nemesis has lost much of the mystery surrounding him and has become almost unbeatable, it’s quite hard to hold suspense when he’s around. I also like that Idris Elba has gotten another starring part in major project, but it’s far from his more memorable work such as in „The Wire“. We don’t get to know enough of gunslinger to care about him deeply – I would say it’s actually part of the problem with the book series too. Elba gets to shoot a lot and growl some lines (on screen, he’s actually chattier than in books) but I can’t say he comes across as terribly charismatic or memorable. Still, some call him one of the best things in the movie. As a long-time King fan, I am still kind of glad to have seen a „Dark Tower“ movie, and the visual side is enjoyable enough – mostly locations, some of the action scenes feel a bit generic. But this is not the movie we’ve been waiting for. At best, we can call it a piece of fan fiction, in the form of long-waited movie. Oh, almost forgot. As a long-time fan, I have read almost all of King’s many novels and collections, and consider „Dark Tower“ series not among his best work. Especially limp are the last two parts (6 and 7), and „Keyhole“. The movie is not limp, at least, just not enough fleshed out to justify all the hype and waiting.","AUG 13, 2017",5,Fantasy
The Dark Tower,"I left the Dark Tower series, entertained but longing for something else. It wasn’t a horrible film, it just felt like a “see once and done” film. The story felt rushed, the tone inconsistent and the film suffered from too many character arcs to really flesh anyone out. When you attempt to fit an entire book series into one movie, you set yourself up for the above mentioned issues. I felt the one saving grace was the performances of Idris Elba and Matthew McConaughey, which were both good. In my opinion the film would have done better if it focused on just one of the books instead of trying to encompass the entire series. I do hear they are making it into a TV series which if done correctly should be able to better capture the thematic elements of the books.","AUG 13, 2017",5,Fantasy

The Dark Tower,"Having not read the books, I came to this without a wealth of knowledge about what is clearly a rich and complex universe, therefore I found this experience both frustrating and perplexing in equal measure. This an an entirely surface experience of a story without the slightest semblance of resonance or time for reflection of any kind. The pacing is so fast as to be almost absurd, and the plot tears through event after event with a superficiality that is at once briskly refreshing, yet fills you with a sense of loss at what is clearly only a thin veneer of what it should be. There is some marvellous cinematography, and it certainly doesn't drag, but the brusque script and some mediocre performances let this film down. There is dissonance here in that, whilst not actually a 'bad' film, neither does it have much to recommend it, and I anticipate that fans of the books would feel cheated by this adaption due to the lack of depth. The cinema equivalent of a fast food dinner, acceptable whilst consuming it, yet utterly unsatisfying upon completion. 5.63/10","AUG 31, 2017",6,Fantasy

The Dark Tower,"A Cinematic Odyssey that undertakes the ambitious task of bringing Stephen King's expansive and beloved novel series to the big screen in all of about 90 minutes. Idris Elba's portrayal of the Gunslinger Roland Deschain is fantastic while McConaughey brings a sinister charm to his role as The Man in Black. The problem with this film is that it's incredibly hard to get this story right in 90 minutes and some change. The story and characters feel rushed and underutilized as the film opts for brevity over exploration, leaving crucial aspects of their backgrounds and motivations unexplored. The film isn't without it's merits as the actions sequences, score and the performances of Elba and McConaughey make this a passable introduction to universe that King created. However, like i said, the film's condensed narrative and simplified character arcs sacrifices the depth and world-building that could have allowed viewers to fully immerse themselves in the intricacies of Mid-World and the conflict between Roland and the Man in Black, portrayed by Matthew McConaughey. Overall, I recommend giving it a try but your enjoyment depends on your expectations and familiarity with the source material. I wasn't smartened up to the source material when I last saw this so I was able to find some enjoyment in it based on that.","JAN 4, 2024",5,Fantasy

It's it's own story and it's a crappy one told on a budget with horrible casting, a mushy, utterly banal script and totally standard special effects.

The Dark Tower,"I expected better, to start right off the bat. Much better. Yet another Stephen King saga set to film with some promise, but manages to come up short. I submit the original ""Rose Red"" and ""It"" for evidence, two movies that are impossibly long, and twice as dull. So at least ""The Dark Tower"" spares us the monotony, but even with the prospect of Matthew McConaughey as a sorcerer set to destroy the Universe which is protected by The Tower, the film never bothering to explain how, and the fine actor Idris Elba, fails to grip the imagination. What matters here is the lack of intensity, emotion, and frightening moments you ought to expect given the premise. McConaughey does not come across as evil as he is supposed to be, nor do his followers. For a character supposedly the last great cosmic Gunslinger, Elba does not connect, and that's really the fault of the script. This movie is disjointed, fails to involve the viewer, and worst of all, comes across as yet one more hack sci-fi/superhero cliche. King's formulas have run their course, and the lack of fresh approaches to what could have been a good movie in better hands is wasted. For a film about impending apocalypse, we're left thinking it will be a boring one.","AUG 4, 2017",3,Fantasy
The Dark Tower,"To put it quite simply, this is not a dark tower movie. I have read every single book in the series and have been a fan for years. I was so, so disappointed by this movie, and how poorly it resembles the book series. The only way that I could think of to do the Dark Tower any justice via visual media would be to hand it over to HBO or Showtime to create an unrated series that takes several seasons (at least one per book if not more) to tell the story as it should be told, and even then I would expect them to ruin it as pretty much every HBO and Showtime series has a specific ""style"" with specific elements that they add that is not a part of any original work that they adapt.

The Dark Tower,"Absolute garbage. Let me set the stage: My wife is a huge fan of the books while I had read the first three and fell out of favor with the series. Going in, we had two completely different schools of thought on what to expect. We BOTH walked out disappointed and annoyed. My wife was annoyed that, even though she understood it was after book 7, they fundamentally changed the structure and the world so much that it, in her words, ""felt like a cheap young adult movie about Jake and not enough about the Roland or Randall Flagg"". For me, I walked out feeling more confused than when I went in because the movie runs at a break neck pace, barely takes time to explain anything, and blows from action scene to action scene. Jake, good. Flashbacks! Roland, good! Man in Black, bad! Cross dimensional conflict, oh no! Idris Elba is literally the only good thing about the movie, a fact on which both of us agreed. It's a shame his talent is wasted on such bad writing, a poorly designed plot, lousy cinematography, and poor CGI. McConaughey was AWFUL, almost a caricature of an actor playing a role. So, so bad. It became quite apparent that this movie was stuck in development hell - to use software terminology - for all 10 years of its supposed creation, especially with a running time as short as made-for-TV movies. If this is the best they can do, no one will mourn when the franchise is left to die. It's just a shame that Idris Elba is still chasing after his own summer blockbuster franchise. Here's hoping he at least gets a fair shake to play Bond after Daniel Craig.

The Dark Tower,"God awful. I went in, a fan of the books, with the lowest expectations, knowing what would be on screen would be different, so I'm not nitpicking about small nuance changes, but rather, immense changes that fundamentally change the story, and certainly not for the better. A major shift in character is Roland. Forget about casting Elba(who did fine,as expected), be more concerned with the night and day difference in the character. In the books, a recurring theme is that Roland is constantly faced with incredibly difficult, life and death choices to make. Roland is who he is because of years of his obsession with the tower costing those around him dearly. In this film, Roland is barely even concerned about the tower at all. Not only does not have to make tough choices, he doesn't make any at all. His character guided through the film on a rail. Jake makes the discoveries, Jake makes the strategy choices. Its Jake that leads Roland. Speaking of Jake, well, readers will know that Jake pays the ultimate price, not once but twice in the first book alone. The second time, a result of another one of Roland's tough choices. The line, ""there are other worlds than these"" is used in promotion of the film, but not used anywhere in the film, and certainly not where it comes from in the book, where it is so pivotal, and causes major change in Roland's character. All missing. Another key missing element, is the journey! Every step of the way in the books is an ordeal unto itself. Here they literally jump from place to place, not really having to earn any of it the way they are forced to in the books. It was nice to see little touches, like the rose graffiti on the wall at the end of the movie, or that Walter's base(?!) is at 19-19. That they say ""thankee sai"" in the village. But all is overshadowed by other major elements reduced to line or two, such as the whole concept of ""the world has moved on"" reduced to Roland not knowing what a theme park is. All of Ka, reduced to Walter's one line ""once more around the wheel my friend."" Its not just that its different. Its that it rips the soul from the story and the characters. It does not resemble the story at all. If you loved the books, you'll likely be disappointed or upset. If you never read the books, you'll likely leave wondering what any of that was about, since they do very little explaining for the uninitiated.","AUG 6, 2017",1,Fantasy

The Dark Tower,"He who trusts Sony with his franchise has forgotten the face of his father…. A film adaptation of Stephen King’s epic seven book series The Dark Tower has been along time coming. After languishing in development hell for decades with directors, stars and studios coming and going, 2017 has finally seen the story of Roland of Gilead and his existential quest for the mysterious Dark Tower brought to life on the big screen. Except not really…. Although I haven’t yet reached the conclusion of the story in its original medium, I know enough to know that this film is for the most part completely divorced from the source material. From the opening text its clear that the filmmakers have decided to simplify and streamline the (admittedly meandering) plot of the books into a more straightforward ‘Macguffin’ plot involving the use of children for evil purposes. From there we get a fairly generic ‘save the world’ story revolving around a young boy from modern day New York (Jake played by Tom Taylor) as he journeys to strange new worlds and meets ‘The Gunslinger’ Roland (Idris Elba) all the while pursued by the sinister agents of The Man in Black (Matthew McConaughey). Making Jake the protagonist of this first attempt to adapt The Dark Tower makes perfect sense. In a complex world of parallel universes, ancient cultures and high fantasy, having a character from ‘our world’ to ask the questions is a tried and tested genre trope (think Neo in The Matrix or any of the Doctor’s companions in Doctor Who). Unfortunately, Jake’s attempts to understand just what the hell is going on are met with vague answers, mountains of exposition and throwaway lines that deserve much more explanation than they are given (did he just say ‘Excalibur’?). For some bizarre reason the filmmakers have decided to try and cram the full story of The Dark Tower, complete with a final confrontation between The Gunslinger and The Man in Black, into one 90 minute film. In a world in which EVERYTHING wants to be a multi-film franchise and The Fast and Furious series has no less than eight entries with a ninth on the way…this choice makes no sense on any level. The film itself doesn’t make a lot of sense either, image if someone tried to edit the entire Harry Potter series into a 90 minute fan film on youtube and then put it out in cinemas — there you have The Dark Tower (2017). One of the most frustrating things about the whole debacle is the casting. Idris Elba is great as Roland, with an unspoken world-weariness coupled with a magnetic screen presence, he is an inspired choice for the part (and another reason I was excited to see the adaptation). Likewise McConaughey brings a detached menace to The Man in Black reminiscent of David Tennant’s Killgrave from Jessica Jones, only this time he has the whole universe at his fingertips. Unfortunately both actors are held back by a thread-bare script with very little in the way of ‘character’ to work with and minimal screen time together. In terms of the plot the stakes couldn’t be higher with the Man in Black seeking to bring about THE END OF THE UNIVERSE by destroying The Dark Tower of the title. This should feel like a big deal, but as the film barrels-on, motivations become less and less clear and the point of the whole thing gets lost in amongst conflicting lore and strange tonal choices. As a comparison, The Lord of Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring did a great job of setting up the potential horror of the world under the rule of Sauron, making it very clear what our heroes were fighting for and setting up their motivations for the next 7 hours of screen time. The Dark Tower instead chooses to make Roland and Jake’s quest to take down the Man in Black far more personal, so much so that by the end, the pair seem fairly apathetic about the whole ‘end of the universe’ thing. More than anything The Dark Tower is a massive wasted opportunity. As a book reader (sort of) it’s hard to know what general audiences with no exposure to the series will make of this cinematic mess but judging from the poor box office it doesn’t look like they thought much. What could have been a epic story spanning over a decade in film or TV has fallen at the first hurdle. While some Stephen King’s fans are understandably angry at the failures of this adaptation I can’t say I feel the same way. I think the negative buzz combined with the short run-time prepared me for the worst. I’m not angry, I’m just disappointed.","DEC 17, 2017",2,Fantasy

The Dark Tower,"Is this movie an entertaining 95 minutes? Yes. Good casting choices? Yes, I loved the actors. Does the film have other good qualities...? Not many. This was one of the worst film adaptations of a novel I've seen. When you consider how long this adaptation has been a concept, how many attempts have been made, and the effort spent to achieve this in 2017? I seriously just don't get it. #CashGrab #AudiencesAreStupid #JustGetItDone? All right, only 5000 characters I can post. Let's get this over with: 1) Tone & Mood. Mostly wrong throughout the film. The books are epic in scale, very dark and brooding. Post-apocalyptic, lonely, desolate, etc. While the film occasionally makes you feel that way, mostly it's ""Just Another Action Film"". Many scenes feel forced. Many scenes feel totally artificial. Not sure what the director was looking for, but they failed. 2) Story. The film's title is misleading. It should have been titled ""Jake's Adventure feat. Roland"". This film was really all about Jake. Everyone else is a guest star. 3) Roland's motivation for pursuing the Man In Blank is *completely* different than the novels. It's nonsense. 4) Roland is supposedly *not* a Gunslinger anymore due to the above point. I cannot even begin to describe how much this irks me. 5) Roland embraces Jake as a friend too early/easily and divulges personal information. I'll just blame the 95 minute length for this one. 6) Walter cannot harm Roland *directly* with magic. However, apparently he can harm Roland *indirectly* with magic, by throwing very sharp and fast objects at him. So while Walter *could* have very easily dispatched the Gunslinger these past dozens of years, or when he killed his father, he didn't...because why not??? 6) Not sure why Jake needs an evil stepfather when his equally careless and inconsiderate father from the novels would have sufficed. Unnecessary script change. 7) Post-apocalypse villagers apparently still have working generators for inter-dimensional portal technology? Wow. Besides blatantly violating the novels, you'd think with such portals and technology at their disposal, they'd have better defenses. Why not zip over to Earth and steal some firearms? 8) No explanation of what Gunslingers actually are. Audience is left wondering what's the point of them. 9) Jake's ""shine"" powers are drastically over-mentioned, over-used, overblown compared to novels. Besides cross-dimensional spying on people, he can maintain inter-dimensional portals? Amazing. 10) Apparently Jake killed the creepy house demon with his powers?!? This was not at all obvious during the ""fight"" scene. Good thing Walter mentioned it later, or I wouldn't have known. 11) Roland briefly teaches Jake to use firearms. Then immediately says Jake doesn't actually need them, because his powers are his mind. What was the point? 12) Random attacks of random things in forest, because we needed some action scenes. Roland, gunslinger supremo, doesn't hear Jake leave camp and wake up immediately? 13) Dark Tower will ultimately be *really* easy to find, since you can just follow the gigantic blue attack-beams made by the Breakers. Of course, they'll likely use one of the many high-tech portals just lying around everywhere... 14) Vampires hide from us the fact they are vampires? Would have make henchmen scarier. I guess we'll be surprised later. 15) Hospital treats Gunslinger for various unusual ailments. Neither he nor Jake have forms of ID. No police called, no security guards at hospital. Gunslinger and Jake just stroll out. 16) Firearms shop person easily ambushed by man with firearms. 17) Inter-dimensional portal in NY kitchen left standing open during latter half of movie? No FBI/CIA/NSA called? Chefs just continue cooking and ignoring gaping portal, until Jake and Roland return? Maybe more of Jake's mysterious mind-portal-control nonsense. 18) Jake is awarded title of gunslinger for staying strapped in chair, resisting mind control, and maybe keeping portal open? Whatever. 19) Does Roland reclaim title of gunslinger for himself? Why? His motivations were rescuing Jake, with a side-motivation of revenge on Walter? Yes, rescuing Jake *happened* to have good results for the Tower. But does Roland ever actually admit he cares about saving it and the universe? 20) Roland's father stands in for Cuthbert and Alain? Seems another unnecessary script change, but fine. 21) Besides the occasional comic relief, Roland seems pretty comfy in NY. Why? Totally different from novels when he sees it through Eddie. 22) Walter is supposed to be unpredictable, kind of crazy, chatty, psycho, never-know-what-he'll-do. In movie he's a pretty serious villain. Well, that's almost 5000 characters. So...people of Earth? Can we acquire some film rights and allow independent filmmakers to redo this someday and do it justice?","AUG 4, 2017",3,Fantasy
Captain Marvel,"Captain Marvel is a really cool movie that tells us the story of Carol Denvers in a fresh and quirky way compared to other Marvel movies. Brie Larson is a perfect choice for portraying her, I couldn't think of anyone else! Plus, the chemistry between her and Samuel L. Jackson is really good, since they're great friends IRL, and capable of delivering lots of unforgettable funny moments. Another thing that makes this movie special for me is the amazing Stan Lee tribute in the Marvel intro and cameo, which I gotta say its my favourite one: a simple, yet powerful heartwarming exchange of genuine smiles between Stan and Brie. Thank you Stan, for everything. Don't let anyone fool you! You might have heard bad things about the movie, the character or even the actress herself, I'm just going to say: watch it and judge for yourself, I'm sure it's going to be worth your while.","JUN 1, 2023",10,Fantasy

Captain Marvel,"Now that the controversy about the movie has settled I watched it. I think it is an entertaining movie with some flaws but definitely good. Back then I had no interest because we wanted to see the conclusion after Infinity War and Captain Marvel had not much appeal similar to the comics (Miss Marvel would be better). I like the story with the good twists, the characters or better said the interactions, the Flerken and action sequences. There are some weaknesses too. Nick Furry is a bit out of character (but still really good), Carols character could be a bit more flashed out by the script (Also works well and won me over) and her Kree teammates are uninteresting or better said mostly wasted. Lets say there is no compelling villain in the movie but this was nearly a standard in the MCU but is now fixed. The story is set before the events of the other Marvel movies in 1995. The alien Kree empire is at war with the Skrulls which have impressive shape shifting abilities. An elite group of Kree warriors is sent on a mission. This is the crucial test for the member Vers to proof herself. She had amnesia after a past mission and struggles with this a flashes of past memories. However things will get far more different than anyone expected. Like I said the story works well and was entertaining. The twists are good even if 1 or 2 things are far foreseeable. For an introduction movie it is definitely a better one. The characters are enhancing the movie. Brie Larson as Captain Marvel works well. Maybe they could improve the script more for her but the criticism for her role and acting is not valid for me. Samuel L. Jackson returns as Nick Fury. He is a bit different than before but so enjoyable that I don't mind. Be warned others were more offended than me about this. Of cause Clark Gregg as Phil Coulson is always a plus. He is one of my favorite characters and I would recommend the first 3 seasons of Agent of Shield by the way. Other than those I praise Ben Mendelsohn as Talos who is amazing, Lahana Lynch as Maria Rambeau, both actors who play her daughter Monica Rambeau and Jude Law as Yon Rogg but he is woften eakened by the script. The cast is in total a positive asset but sometimes weakened by the script. The humor works well but to be fair cant keep up with the more humorous Marvel movies. The Flerken is interesting but I think this is just a normal cat that does not hide the true self like all the others ;-). The special effects are top notch as always and I repeat that this is no issue in the MCU. Overall while not one of the best Marvel movies this is not a failure. I was thinking of a 7-8/10 but think a 7 is maybe too low. Lets say I rounded it up to an 8/10.","JAN 11, 2022",8,Fantasy

Captain Marvel,"This story has a sympathetic heroine, good action, great plot twists, great humor and an excellent supporting cast. One of the best being… a cat . Plus, you can actually follow what is going on at every moment. It has not too many characters to confuse the viewer. Nor does it have the visual overdosing that several superhero movies suffer from – dozens of characters or objects fighting each other and so many split-second shots that you have no idea what is actually happening, which in my humble opinion is irritating to most viewers with the possible exception of the very best computergamers… Brie Larson is a ‘Skree’ soldier named Vers who suffers from memory flashes showing her people and places she does not remember. Vers is tasked to bring back a spy who infiltrated their enemy, the Skrull. The Skrull have lizardlike faces but can mimic any other lifeform down to the DNA, which makes it extremely difficult to screen them out. The mission is blown and she is captured but manages to escape during interrogation. Somehow – later to be revealed – Vers possesses huge powers. Using them during her escape, she blasts the Skrull spaceship, which turned out to be orbiting Earth. Vers and the remaining Skrull fall down to earth in the year 1995. She contacts her commander, Jude Law, who is lightyears away, in a 3-dimensional representation using… a payphone. Until the connection is broken by the Earth operator informing that a payment card is required for this long-distance call…. The agent meeting her is none other than Nick Fury / Samuel L. Jackson – and here we have the first SHIELD connection and run-up to creation of the Avengers. On Earth the conflict continues, involving a.o. a spectacular fight on a train between vers and a nice old lady / Skrull, of course. After some prelude, Vers and Fury team up, not being sure who else to trust anymore as even Fury’s sidekick Colson turns out to be an impersonator. As the action progresses, Vers finds out that she herself was actually born on Earth and became Airforce pilot Carol Danvers. Danvers and Fury proceed to follow up with old contacts from Danvers. Down the line it is revealed that actually the Skrulls are a prosecuted minority in Skree territory and a Dr. Lawson of NASA, working together with Danvers, was a Skree agent on Earth but had a change of heart and decided to use the technology she developed to protect the Skrulls, embedding it on a cloaked Skree cruiser orbiting Earth. But she and Danvers were taken out by the Skree before the plot could be completed. Having seen the evidence, Danvers like Lawson has a change of heart and with Fury and an old Airforce colleague, Maria Rambeau, decides to help the Skrull. She finds the cloaked spaceship, where Lawson had already harbored several Skrull, amongst them the family of Skrull Leader Talos. Obviously this turn of events is much to the dislike of Vers her commander, who turns against her. Several skirmishes ensue. (Dan)Vers is now captured by the Skree who try to take away her powers, using an earlier installed control chip. However, Danvers manages to bring her powers under control and defies her captors. Meanwhile Fury, Danvers colleague Rambeau and the Skrulls escape due to the power outage Danvers causes on the ship and with the unlikely help of a cat - who turns out to be a bit more than a cat. When the dust settles, Nick Fury is tasked with finding more superheroes such as Danvers to form an Earth protection force. And the rest, as we say, is history. Avengers history, of which this movie is a worthy prequel.","DEC 27, 2023",8,Fantasy

Captain Marvel,"Coming back with an updated review. I've rewatched this film multiple times since it came out and, honestly, it's just rising to earn the title of my favorite Marvel movie at this point. It just gets better every time. I've come to really appreciate Brie Larson's acting-- the wit and charm her character has. This film really resonates with me and the journey she goes on with gaslighting and identity. Ignore the 0 and 1 ratings, those are likely just the incels that keep trying to lower the film's status. They're pretty easy to spot. This film is ace.","AUG 1, 2022",10,Fantasy
Captain Marvel,"Despite some of the controversy about this movie and along with Larson, I thought it was pretty alright. The plot doesn't make sense in some cases, and there are some contrived moments, such as the fact that Nick Fury, a man who has a high ranking in SHEILD, is dispatched to a strange event at a Blockbuster along with a rookie. I did however really like the twist that the Kree were the villains the whole time, and Carol was brainwashed by them to fight against the ""enemy"" which were really just refugees. There are some funny moments in this movie. Perhaps not as much as other MCU movies, but it is refreshing to not have the characters quip every 2 sentences like in Thor: Love and Thunder. Carol is a bit overpowered at the end, but to be fair the final confrontation between her and Yon-Rogg was pretty funny because of how easily she blasted him away. This movie certainly deserves more than a 3.0, which was the overall audience score at the time that I write this.","APR 17, 2023",7,Fantasy
Captain Marvel,"Fun origin movie, the famous ""popcorn movies"" to watch, however, none of its characters ever feel special, you feel no connections whatsoever with any character (maybe aside from Fury), and the movie doesn't really go anywhere.

Captain Marvel,"I'm rather pleasantly surprised by what I saw, on Twitter I was sold some feminist shit for two francs and six cents, yet another reason to delete Twitter Frankly, I didn't find it intrusive at all in the film and I I even find that it's well managed in fact. We can't just shout about woke propaganda just because the protagonist is a woman, even if it's deliberate. We have to know how to differentiate between stupidly inclusive works based on quotas, other films that go beyond that And here that's the case, we have a coherent character development and we don't just boil it down to its genre, so I find it stupid people who close themselves a priori just for that I had to talk about it because in reality it's an element that has biased a lot of criticism and I find that unfortunate. Indeed when we look at it retrospectively of all the dramas that there have been we realize that it was really just uninteresting political divisions The development of the hero is therefore rather successful in my opinion The writing is not Badly too, I find that it changes from the usual formula of superhero films based on fight -> humor -> emotions -> fight -> humor -> emotions. It mixes well here in any case that's the feeling I had Then, in terms of fx it's amazing we can see directly that it's quite recent, it gives something more to Captain Marvel Concerning the scenario it's not crazy but hey if we go to see a superhero film we don't expect more, unfortunately But in the Marvel chronology it's a good point in the end because it leaves an opening for the sequel (I'm trying to defend the script as best I can)","JUN 18, 2023",7,Fantasy

Ignore the lowest reviews that cite SJW nonsense. I’m a white man in my 40s, and I 100% agree with what Brie Larson ACTUALLY SAID about movie reviewers. The offense taken at her statements—which have been viewed completely out of context—led many racist and sexist trolls to try to ruin this film before anyone saw it. They failed, and I’m glad. This is NOT just a movie about girl power. Carol Danvers is absolutely not OP from the start, nor is she “wooden” and “emotionless.” Carol goes through quite a journey of self rediscovery and realization of the forces that have abused and exploited her for years. This film has all the elements **** superhero film, and does it in a way that both fits well into the MCU and shows young girls that they can be heroes, too, no matter how many times they are knocked down by the world.

Jackson's character get a deeper dive and bigger screen time than usual. I also liked Ben Mendelsohn as Talos. Other cast members, like Jude Law, are fine if forgettable.

Besides the super powers, all the best goalies in the galaxy and Iron Man are there. I must say that I do not really know what to tell so much movies are alike. I am sad to see that the risk taking is limited, but that the evolution of visual quality is very present. Holograms are a bit like black panther without the metallic and gray aspect. Beside the main character is not so captain but Fury and I must say that this actor plays the game to the end. This film can be positioned second in the Marvel environment. And in the last Thanos will take a power that will make him dance. Captain Marvel un nouveau encore... reste plus beaucoup de ces films avant end game. Cette héroïne ne possède rien de particulier. À part les super pouvoirs, tout le meilleur des gardiens de la galaxie et d'Iron Man s’y retrouve. Je dois dire que je ne sais pas vraiment quoi raconter tellement les films se ressemblent. Je suis triste de voir que la prise de risque est limitée, mais que l'évolution qualité des visuels est très présente. Les hologrammes sont un peut comme black panthère sans l'aspect métallique et gris.

There are definitely some great moments with Nick Fury (I am not saying I want a Nick Fury solo movie, please, don't make that a thing) and I really enjoyed some of the moments with the Skrull played by Ben Mendelsohn, but on the whole I found the movie to be a bit lackluster. Certainly not the weakest movie in Marvels line-ups (Thor 2 and Captain America 1 have that privilege) but it just generally wasn't on par with what you expect from Marvel after they have had over a decade to perfect the formula.","NOV 4, 2019",5,Fantasy
Captain Marvel,"""Space invasion, big car chase... truth be told, I was ready to hang it up. 'Till I met you today."" One year later - nobody's talking about this, expect for me right now. All that fuss and name calling over an average by the book superhero movie. One of the blandest and most forgettable movies of last year, which I just remembered to login as watched. Brie Larson, who has proven in the past to be a talented actress with amazing range, but is unfortunately the weakest link in the movie. I thought her performance was incredibly wooden and the least interesting part of the movie. Her line delivery felt really off and there wasn't anything there for me to care about her character. All backstory with very little depth. It might have just been the poor material she was given to work with. I'm sorry, but not once did I believe this is the strongest character in the MCU. The issue is that the movie does a terrible job of actually showing us that she is powerful and important. They tell us rather than show us. Like OK, she shoots lasers, flies around and has some magical glow around her. Am I suppose to be impressed? The story itself is really messy and unfocused. It's trying so hard to be an origin story while also setting up the next installment for future movies, but also having a Bourne element into the mix of connecting pieces to the past. Also I can't believe they did Lee Pace dirty. Not just once, but twice now! However, there are some things I liked in the movie that stopped it from being the worst thing ever. I love the tribute to Stan Lee on the Marvel Studios opening intro, which was such a loving touch to his legacy. The de-aging on Samuel L. Jackson was fantastic and shows us how far technology has come. Although towards the end the effects started to look a bit wonky for some reason. Jackson himself was charismatic and a blast to watch. It was interesting to see a younger and goofy version of Nick Fury before he gets super serious. I love Goose the Cat, just don't let her anywhere near your eyes. The Skrulls were enjoyable ""villains"" and Ben Mendelsohn absolutely shines as one of the Skrulls. And that's really it for positives. Overall rating: ""Being powerful is like being a lady. If you have to tell people you are, you aren't."" - Margaret Thatcher Yes, I actually took a quote from Thatcher. I honestly should just delete my account right now.","MAR 5, 2020",4,Fantasy

(I just really love cats. Sue me!) Cons: Nick Fury is a complete joke in this movie, Carol Danvers is an emotionless character with no flaws and no personality, the movie takes place in the 90s but feels completely inauthentic and inconsistent with the time period, the sexism that Carol experiences is unrealistic and over-the-top, the movie retcons the entire MCU just to make its Mary Sue protagonist seem more important than she really is, and given the fact that Carol is written as an overpowered and flawless character, I never felt that there was any real conflict. All in all, the movie was better than I feared it would be (I was expecting it to be complete garbage), but it was just so bland and boring. I don’t want to see a movie about a talking plank of wood; I want to see a movie with character development and stakes. I want to see a movie that takes place in the 90s (my childhood) that doesn’t feel like modern-day America with characters that tell you how “90s” the movie is every two minutes.

So the fans must assume her story to be something on the same level of the other new characters that were introduced in Phase III, particularly just before Avengers: Endgame. There were Doctor Strange and Black Panther who had their own fun adventures just before Infinity War, which is really needed if the movie wants the audience to actually care about that character when heroes like Spider-Man, Iron Man, Captain America etc are also present on the same screen. But sadly, Captain Marvel wasn't able to live upto the hype. I'm in no means saying that this is an absolutely horrible movie. I really liked it, but only as long as the movie was running. Once the movie was over I was like, ""Wait, why was I so excited again?"". I went to watch the movie as an absolute blank slate. I had heard of Brie Larson giving a controversial statement, but I'm not gonna judge an entire movie over one actress' behaviour. Rather I'd judge it because of the content that was in it. And that's what I'm gonna do. This movie absolutely nails the 90s vibe. The characters look just as ugly as we used to look in our 90s pictures. The introduction of a young Nick Fury, the plot twist, the Stan Lee cameo, the CGI - I liked it all. But what I didn't like was, well, to put it in simpler words, literally everything else. The acting, music, costumes (when Monica was seeing the different colour combinations she saw all the awesome ones and rejected them, and finally chose the ugliest one), and even the revelation of how Nick Fury got an eyepatch were terrible. In my opinion this was the worst MCU movie made in the third phase, not just because it lacked content, it didn't even have any important significance. This movie didn't even need to exist, since Captain Marvel just says in Endgame that she was out protecting the other universes. So the whole point of ""introducing Captain Marvel"" was pointless, as it could have been done just like how Black Widow and Hawkeye were done in The Avengers; give her a cameo in the previous movies and then bring her directly to Endgame.","APR 5, 2021",5,Fantasy

Captain Marvel,"As a fan of superhero movies, I had high expectations for ""Captain Marvel."" However, I must admit that I was deeply disappointed. The film desperately tries to be inclusive and empower women, but its approach results in a forced and inauthentic effort. The biggest problem I found was the way the film presents female empowerment. Instead of creating a strong, believable character, ""Captain Marvel"" seems more interested in pushing a political message than developing a coherent story. Instead of letting us discover for ourselves the power and capability of Carol Danvers, the film constantly bombards us with messages about how incredibly powerful she is. The dialogue and interactions between the characters also leave a lot to be desired. In its attempt to portray Carol Danvers as an inspiring figure for women, the film falls into clichés and stereotypes. Instead of showing her strength and determination through meaningful actions, we are presented with unnatural and unconvincing motivational speeches and phrases. Furthermore, the plot itself lacks depth and originality. It seems like a tour of the common places of the superhero genre, without offering anything new or exciting. The plot twists are predictable and lack impact, making the film feel boring and forgettable. The cast, despite having talented actors, fails to shine due to a weak script and poorly developed characters. Brie Larson, in the role of Carol Danvers, fails to convey the charisma and strength necessary to make the character memorable. The other supporting characters also don't have enough screen time to be properly developed. In terms of direction and production, the film lacks a clear and cohesive vision. The action scenes are confusing and poorly choreographed, making it difficult to follow the action and understand what is happening on screen. In short, ""Captain Marvel"" is a disappointment in many ways. Its attempt to be inclusive and empowering feels forced and inauthentic, and the lack of a solid plot and characters makes the film boring and forgettable. While it is important to promote gender equality in film, this film is not the right example of how to do it effectively and convincingly.","JUN 22, 2023",2,Fantasy

Most has already been said and I agree, it is the worst marvel movie to date because the main character is a Mary Sue. She simply has no hero journey, she is basically invincible, uber powerful and all that is holding her back is toxic masculinity. Once she overcomes this (took her long enough, a whole movie actually) nothing will ever be able to stand in her way again. That is the recipe for a boring movie, a bland character and a lot of hate from the fans. Black Widow is beloved by all, because she has to struggle, she grows, she changes, she entertains, she values her friends, male and female alike, and she is not a plot device to drive home a political message.","JAN 14, 2022",3,Fantasy

I was so bored the whole way through that I checked to see if the movie was over about two dozen times and every single time I did, there as still far too much runtime left. Possibly the worst superhero movie Marvel has ever made. I didn't care about ANYTHING in this movie. The plot, the characters, the ""stakes"", none of it had any meaning to me. I have to wonder who this movie was made for in the first place. I'm a casual MCU viewer (wouldn't really count myself as a ""fan"" yet) and I failed to find anything of value in this movie, so maybe it's for more hardcore fans of the series? Certainly it wasn't for me. If 1/10 was Game of Thrones Season 8 and 5/10 was Avengers: Age of Ultron (a painfully average movie), I'd give this movie a 3/10.","MAY 24, 2022",3,Fantasy

It's so simple. You have to be a extremely bad writer/director/producer to make something so great so bad. It's also extremely unethical to take someone's life's work and change the source material with such disrespect. Then, just to make everything so much worse, you add on top of that fan baiting. Fan Baiting is done on purpose to not only stir up controversy for publicity but also serves as a barrier to real criticism and ensures that the show will succeed because if anyone has a different opinion, they will just be labeled as a ""racist/sexist/transphobe/etc."" and their opinion is ignored. It's a method to make everyone think you're virtuous when really you're just a horrible person spreading hate with anyone who has a different opinion than your own.

Captain Marvel,"So what makes this movie bad? Well, we can start with the fact that they completely destroyed the original Captain Marvel’s story. Mar-Vell is a he, and he saved Carol’s life with his own blood. Not only did they neuter Mar-Vell and turn him into an old woman, but they took his caring and selfless act and made it a twisted manipulation play by the kree. The kind of feminism at play in this “captain marvel” is not the kind you’d find in a respectable female-driven movie like Black Widow. No, this is the virulent, spiteful, arrogant, man-hating kind that really doesn’t show a woman’s best features at play, but really some of the worst. No serious self-reflection. No respect for her natural limits and what makes a woman a woman. No, it’s the kind of woman that really and actually resents being a woman. The kind of woman that really wants to be a man, and can’t help but relish in being overpowered so she can dish out her perceived slights, insecurity, and general overall inferiority complex on anyone not female in either subtle or explicit ways. And if it’s not her doing it, well then the director’s gonna play deus ex machina and make sure all you get from this movie is “girls rule, boys drool.” Sure, Ms. Marvel eventually becomes the posterwoman for women’s grievances in the comics, and thus she becomes a butchered and battered character over time in order to become the epitome of women’s suffering…but that’s not Captain Marvel’s origin story. Ms. Marvel doesn’t even start out like that. Why not just respect the original story? Why not just show Captain Marvel saving Carol and training her to be Ms. Marvel and then do an amazing spinoff with an amazing leading lady in Ms. Marvel who eventually takes the reigns after the original Captain Marvel’s death? Ridiculous pseudo-feminism, that’s why. Propaganda and screeching at the sky trying to force everyone to agree with you because you’re entitled to be treated more seriously than you deserve or are actually entitled to. TLDR: This movie throws out the tesseract plot thread of phase one and makes Nick Fury look like an idiot pawn that somehow stumbled into a position of power; Continuous cheap shots at men and terrible lessons for women; misplaced 90s hits splattered throughout at a vain attempt to make the movie cooler than it was; disrespectful of the actual initial plot and character development of Mar-Vell and Carol Danvers; and finally, just the overall fact that the movie did not even need to exist.

Cinematography is pedestrian. The screenplay is pedestrian. The story of growing up presented here itself is not very compelling. Sorry to say but the child actors here really were very bad at acting (not that that could have been foreseen when they started). The only really neat or special part of this movie is watching the children age as the film progresses, which does not by itself make it deserving of a perfect score for film-making all time.

Not everyone will have this reaction, but this guy's personality when he gets older is insufferable to the point that I wish I could slap him. As a boy, his experiences are some that any boy/man could relate to. As a young adult, he becomes smug and whiney and almost regressed to a teenage state. That being said, this was a very ambitious project by Linklater with a lot of really great material early on, and a couple of great performances by Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke.

From high school on I continued watching because I felt I had to having invested so much time in it.","FEB 7, 2015",5,Drama

Boyhood,"In brief. Want to see a great film about boyhood? See This Boy's Life. Want to see Ethan Hawke's best? See Predestination. Want to save 3 hours? Skip Boyhood. I loved Before Sunset, Sunrise, and Midnight. But Boyhood is not good. DO NOT BELIEVE THE HYPE. Boyhood gets attention for the gimmick of being filmed sporadically over 12 years, so you get to see the kids in the movie grow up. Big whoop. Not an ounce of Hollywood gloss here. The movie goes for realism in the extreme. Homes are dirty, kind of crappy and depressing. It also passes over obvious places other movies would go; it skips cliches. No the step dad does not try to sexually abuse his step daughter. Which was a breath of fresh air. But it also crosses a line of being too realistic in terms of having no real plot. For awhile there IS kind of a plot as the mother deals with a difficult domestic drama. But after that the film sprawls. Example. The dad (minor spoiler, nothing big; probably you'll read about it in any review) seems not entirely to have reached closure with his ex. Maybe is considering getting back with her? But suddenly the movie cuts; it's years later; the dad is with another woman and has had a baby with her. I don't know about you, but between those cuts there might have been some good drama, but it's just skipped. Despite the title, the film dwells on every family member, so it's not like Ethan Hawke is a minor character. Yet they pass over a giant life event. Minor spoiler is now over. Yes stories should flow from character, but there should still be a story. Character reveals itself through the crucible of a crisis. Aside from the drama early on with the mom's domestic issue, there is no crisis here, and no story. When Hitchcock was asked what he thought of slice-of-life stories, he said he preferred to give people a slice of cake. I left this movie hungry for that cake. And besides, so-called slice-of-life stories, the good ones, do have a crisis. It's just that it's subtle. We didn't get that here. There is no depth of the boy's life plumbed here. Just sketchy skit-like scenes semi-related. Another point. Aside from Ethan Hawke, no one in this movie seems to have a positive attitude about anything ever. It's one thing not to be Disney, but this movie mistakes chronic maudlin negativity for drama. A story requires conflict. But much of the activity in this film doesn't rise to the level of actual conflict. Instead it's just a manifestation of some kind of low grade depression that never quits and slowly grinds down the teeth on the gears of your spirit. Even though the movie is too realistic, in other ways it is too unrealistic. There is oddly stilted fake sounding dialog in the first 20 minutes or so. Also, the son (the ""boy"" of the title) encounters adult men who act exactly the same toward him all the time, step dad, teacher, boss, all of them criticize him in exactly the same way, and that's all they do. You could switch out the dialog for all these guys. They are all the same. Except Ethan Hawke. Another unrealistic thing. When the boy finally lands a girlfriend, she just happens to be one of the most beautiful women you've ever seen in a movie. This pimply pug nosed boy, without athleticism, brilliance, money, or particular promise, gets a girlfriend who probably would have thought herself too good for a young George Clooney. It's ridiculous. And they were going for extreme realism? In my own life growing up I encountered some real weird ****. So did friends. They say '**** happens' for a reason. But if this is supposed to be this kid's life, either they skipped over that type of dramatic stuff or he had one heck of a mundane childhood! Also, these people seem to have no center. If they have values or principles or beliefs, that's skipped over too. There is some banter that might try to be passing for philosophy but it amounts to nothing of substance. Yes as an adult paying bills and just trying to survive, you don't go around espousing basic values every day of your life, but these people seem so empty inside, as if they are animals that just happen to be able to speak. There's something off-putting about them from my perspective. They are not like people I have ever known. Ethan Hawke does a good job acting in Boyhood, but why did he agree to do it? Predestination, his other new movie, is sci-fi, but it's also a study of character as revealed and developed through a protagonist's response to a crisis. It is stellar, brilliant, the best of the best. I am chalking it up on my list of the very best films (of any genre) that I have seen. It will be right beside Before Sunset on my BLU Ray shelf. Predestination raised Ethan Hawke in my estimation, and even Boyhood, which I saw a short time later, cannot bring him down entirely. So let me divert you dear reader. See Predestination.

Boyhood,"Boyhood is groundbreaking because it took 12 years to film, but the end result is a movie that is far from satisfying. With a 2 hours 45 minute run time, the film is much too long. I can only surmise that director Richard Linklater became so personally invested in the film that he was unable to leave anything on the cutting room floor. The film is a story is about the life of an adolescent boy, Mason (Ellar Coltrane) and his slightly older sister, Samantha (Lorelei Linklater). You get to watch them grow up from about age 6 until they leave home for college. Patricia Arquette and Ethan Hawke play their divorced parents. Throughout his boyhood, Mason is subdued and reserved. There are no milestones in his life to celebrate, no tragedies to mourn, no joyous moments, no outbursts of anger; just long periods of monotonous existence. His life is like that of a rubber duck on a river. He simply goes where the river of life takes him. The currents and eddies periodically trap him and then take him further downstream. I waited in anticipation for fate to intervene, for tragedy to strike, for something - anything - to happen! Instead, watching Mason evolve into an adult was sort of like watching paint dry. The lives of Mom, Dad and Sister are equally unsatisfying to watch. Samantha has a bigger, naturally ebullient personality, than her brother but the film focuses almost exclusively on Mason and we end up knowing almost nothing about her life. Dad cares about his kids but is a late bloomer and, at least initially, is pretty rough around the edges when it comes to parenting. He sees his kids on weekends, tries hard to engage them in conversation, and gives them the kind of talks that you would expect from a Dad in a movie like Sixteen Candles. The speeches come across as odd because Dad lives with a professional musician in a dirty apartment complete with empty beer bottles, cigarette butts and a little drug paraphernalia. Thus, his words are completely incongruent with the life that he lives. Mom’s life is like a twisted version of Ground Hog Day. She goes back to college, begins dating her professor and ends up marrying him. Over time he becomes an angry alcoholic. Mom leaves him and moves the kids to another part of Texas. Mom then becomes a community college professor, starts dating one of her students, and ends up marrying him. Rinse and repeat. Ultimately, Mom ends up alone and, as Mason leaves for college, wonders if this is all that life has to offer. Minutes after Mason arrives at college he meet a girl, takes a mind altering drug, goes on a hike, watches the sun set, and realizes that he is happy. The ending is a lot like nouvelle cuisine at a highly popular restaurant: The wait is too long and what arrives on the plate is too little to be truly enjoyable.","FEB 14, 2015",6,Drama

Boyhood,"I can see some appeal it this movie, but I think it depends on how you are going to relate to it or if you are even in the right mood to observe+relate rather than just being entertained. I don't care much about the 12 years of real time either, because it only added so much in the overall experience. I would prefer more focused and interesting story-line instead. That being said, it is hard to predict how every other spectator would precept it and from what angle. But one thing, I am quite certain of, is that it dragged too much for what could be much shorted and more eventful tale. The ending was kind of charming though.","FEB 19, 2015",6,Drama
Boyhood,"I'll make things clear from the beginning: I enjoyed 'Boyhood' way more than six out of ten. It has some honestly touching and moving scenes, moments and evolutions. Empathy for the characters is sometimes effortless, sometimes really hard considering some of their choices. 'Boyhood' appear to be in many ways the story of a regular boy (and by extension his ever-changing family) living in America. This movie has no other pretention than to show daily routines and the lukewarmness of reality and it successfully manages to do so. This film features ordinary characters dealing with real life issues such as financial problems, (multiple) separations and divorces, growing up and aging, changing careers, witnessing domestic violence, forging an identity, etc. Acting is poor in overall (excepted for Ethan Hawke obviously) which contributes to make almost all characters look like normal people. Anyway, we have to admit that Richard Linklater made a risky bet on this film and really put all the chances on his side. It's a pity that he had to fall into the trap of conventions far too often and especially by making terrifying adults by their stereotyped characters. With this particular artistic and conceptual approach of filming for 12 years, we have a finished product with no particular plot and that suffers from spasms making it even harder to understand the red line throughout. Too many scenes appear to be anecdotic or meaningless. The beginning isn't a true beginning, the end surely not an end. 'Boyhood' is way more like a documentary about daily life in this first quarter of 21st century than an actual movie.","MAY 4, 2021",6,Drama
Boyhood,"As a movie i enjoy it, but as a Richard Linklater movie it was really disappointing and i think it doesn't live up for the praise the critics has given to it (although i think they were paid off). I still thought it was a good movie that require some effort and i appreciate that. I like it as a journey of growing up with some relatable things and nostalgic events, but other than that it was EXTREMELY FLAWED. A lot of things that happened through the first half and second half were really underdeveloped and If you think about it, it doesn't make sense and you end up seeing it as a mess. The screenplay was good but some parts of it were really forced and written in a poor and unfocused way just to give sense to the scenes. I was expecting the script to be as amazing as the one in the ""Before trilogy"" (directed by Linklater), but it wasn't that good. If the screenplay was like ""Before Sunset"" the movie would be an epic masterpiece, but sadly it wasn't. It is really sad, because in both movies (Boyhood and Before Sunset) there is a huge dependence on the script and that's because it doesn't happen that much on the story of both films. Before Sunset worked really great but Boyhood not so much. I was entertained by it and it's concept was interesting, but it is difficult for me to see it as one of the best movies of 2014.","MAR 14, 2015",6,Drama

Boyhood,"Films with such critical praise are usually fantastic. But that isn't the case with Boyhood. Richard Linklater delivers a boring, gimmick of a movie with next to no redeeming qualities. There's a lot of ham fisted scenes: such as the domestic abuse scene, which felt rushed and on the nose. As someone who's experienced this I can tell you that it's the most generic domestic violence ever put to film. Another thing wrong with this film is how long and boring it is. The film has nothing that makes you keep watching. The main character, I did not like- I thought he was a bit of an ass and I didn't care about the supporting characters (except Ethan Hawk). Speaking of Ethan Hawk, he's by far the best part of the film next to the cinematography and shot composition. It's a technically well made film, but it's boring as hell. If you'd have took about 30 minutes off of the run time, it might have been digestible. But no, it's long, drawn out and pretentious. Linklaters director is noting to get hype about its fine. Nothing worse nothing more. The script was okay but could feel a bit cheesy at times. Overall this is a boring, unmemorable and unrewarding experience that doesn't deserve most of the praise it's getting.","SEP 7, 2016",4,Drama
Boyhood,"The idea behind this film was a fantastic one. It sought to do what no previous film had ever attempted, that being filming the actors over several years as they grew rather than trying to cast others who looked similar at various ages. That in and of itself is a remarkable feat. However, like many films that try to accurately emulate what real life is like, this story didn't have much of a plot. It is understandably difficult to have an overarching theme when trying portray the life and struggles of an adolescent boy. That is perhaps why this particular film seemed to wander significantly. There were a couple of really good scenes and a few powerful lessons that one could take away from this motion picture, but simply good scenes, unfortunately, do not make a good movie.","AUG 26, 2021",6,Drama

Boyhood,"At the end of the 165 minute film, I started to cry. I cried for about 10 minutes at how bad this movie was. I could not believe that I had wasted 2 hours and 45 minutes on a film that has accurately represented American mediocrity. I wasn't just blown away by the mediocrity of the film, I was also blown away by the films portrayal of a mediocre family. Do not mistake the intent of this critique, I wanted to honestly and accurately portray what I felt after watching this film. There are way too many things that were decidedly unprofessional, and mind you, I am taking it lightly on the children's' acting. There was one very interesting dynamic of the film that goes far beyond the screen which merits the only point I have to offer this pathetic film. Let us begin this dreadful evaluation. There are many things that make this film disgustingly unappealing. The simple fact that it took 12 years to come up with mediocrity just shows lack of creativity. I did not enjoy watching a portrayal of a mediocre mother making extremely idiotic decisions whilst raising two children. Who still marks the doorframe to check up on height? Samantha using a phone during her elementary school years? That seems like bad parenting, just like the majority of this movie. Who pays money for cursing? While I grew up, if my parents heard cursing no matter where we were, someone was going to have it (I was an only child). Now don't get me wrong, my parents were never ""abusive"". They were aware of how to discipline in a controlled fashion and still manage to create a sense of respect and admiration from me. Next up, collecting rocks? Are you kidding? My parents made sure I never got into dirty habits such as collecting rocks or running around barefoot, or drinking at 15, or even having a cell phone. My parents never went on vacations without me during my developing years, my parents didn't allow me to say ""whatever"" as a response. My father never liked me playing video games, my father didn't drink until I was old enough to understand what occasion I should drink (age 20). Obviously I mention these things because the opposite of what happened to me happened in the film. All the things that you expect from an incredibly cliché family is included in the film, such as divorce (multiple). Drinking problems, high school problems, and college problems. If you name the ridiculous fad off the top of your head, it's probably here. Cliché divorced dad that give presents to make up for being a somewhat lousy father. Taking your kids to watch a game? Jesus, really? I can't take even remembering the film. Constant moving? Oh woe is me. Abuse? Woe is me. Don't worry I won't need to delve into the leftist stance this movie has, I would rather not stoop low enough as to talk about politics but this film shamelessly did so. Disappointed at father for a bad decision? Woe is me. The teachers advice in the darkroom was insightful at best. ""Seniors having fun"", that quote in my book is like a sin. Getting home late and ignoring advice? I did that once, lived outside for a week afterwards. This cast gave me a small tumor from rage. Finally the only redeeming quality of the film was the fact that they made the story so broad and mediocre that most critics could relate and feel empathy for the film. The only strategy that worked is making the story broad enough for people to relate to it, despite it being complete trash. Final Sentence: Boyhood is a good title because the kid never became a man.","JAN 19, 2017",1,Drama

Boyhood,"I watched boyhood and oh my... well, I don't know if I should share but the film makes you feel as though you SHOULD think it's a classic because you are watching these people age and develop, but in reality they definitely do age but develop very little. It's as disjointed a film as you would expect from the way it was filmed over such a long period, it doesn't struggle to be coherent because there's absolutely no challenge in that respect for it to do so. There's nothing artful about the way the film is put together, it's a sequence of moments, which makes sense if you think about the last scene, a scene which tries to make this profound link, like a series of moments with nothing really changing but it feels flat, and again maybe that is the point, that it should feel flat and banal because that's more realistic but the film also tries to be something else by having several linking scenes with sombre indie songs playing in the background, the songs are so tacked on and don't reflect the mood well at all. Whether it's his character or just bad acting, Mason is underwhelming, and so is his sister through most of the film, funnily enough they both seem to act better as young kids, but as they grow the cracks start to show in the performances, I get they have been directed to act as naturally and realistically as possible but it comes across as just awkward bad acting in some scenes, which should have been cut or edited better, the editing was the worst thing about the film, far too many pointless cuts and lingering shots that do nothing, one sweeping shot is so bad it sticks out like a sore thumb. The editing was poor in terms of the sequence of moments as well, it was a basic timeline, but it was put together with no flair. In my opinion the best thing about the film was Patricia Arquette and her character, she was a very realistic mother, and the nuance to her performance reminded me of my own mom, I thought her performance was the best in the film, Ethan Hawke was good as well, and he absolutely carries the scenes with the kids. I don't think it should be viewed as groundbreaking just because ageing happens to the characters, it should be judged as just another film, I was ready to enjoy this film, and I found it relatively enjoyable, and it wasn't that the pacing was too slow, just that it felt monotonous, the film gets better, it has peaks and troughs. Maybe i'm missing the profundity of the understated realism that is the films essence, but it would feel more profound for me if i looked through some of my own family photographs and reminisced, the sentiment was lost on me, I didn't feel it but maybe that's because i have a cold stone for a heart","FEB 25, 2015",2,Drama

It should therefore not be surprising that the film exceeds 2 hours 40 minutes, because in truth, it could have been worse... although as it stands, this very psycho-social thing is already out of date before being finished or possibly consumed.

Boyhood,"This is one of the worst movies I have seen in years. I had to fight myself to finish it. I agree with all the comments that this was an ambitious project. Twelve years to make a movie is, if nothing else, an exercise in patience. I think it is an admirable accomplishment with the best of intentions. However, all the effort provided absolutely zero benefit to the lackluster story. The story started bad, then it got worse. I can see no other reason for all the positive reviews accept for the fact that it was such an ambitious project. All the ambition in the world did not make the product any good. Using the same actors as the children aged did not add any value to the movie. What was the point? It was just a bad story. What makes in more annoying is that they had twelve years to put together a good movie and this is what we got!? I have nothing against Patricia Arquette but her performance was certainly not worthy of any specific notoriety. The only reason she got an oscar was for commitment to the film but certainly not for her performance. It has been a long time since I have been mad that I wasted time on a movie but today, I see my streak is over. I am flat out pissed that I wasted my time on this movie.

Boyhood,A film where the cinematographic force is as strong as that of a mouse. The dialogues are interesting ... but when putting it in place we put it next to where the mediocre movies are placed. Mediocre in the sense of wanting to evoke literature and not the cinema. A shameful movie.,"AUG 17, 2018",1,Drama
Boyhood,"So this is one of the most boring movies ever made. No, I did not dislike it because it was long. I don't mind long movies. First, the cinematography is fine, the dad and the mom were great but that's pretty much it. The boy is the most unlikable character I've ever seen a movie be completely about, that wasn't trying to make the character unlikable. The early parts were fine, it had a sense of slow progression but looking back a mere 45 minutes you realize so much had happened since then. If anything, the idea behind the film is the best part: watching a boy grow up before our eyes. This is done well. But when the boy is a jaded **** for the majority of the movie (once he becomes a teenager) it's just bad. No matter how much work the crew did, or Richard Linklater, if the movie **** then it **** ****. I'm assuming people like this movie because of the obscenely high scores it gets and sort of a lemming effect, but I encourage you to look at the movie critically and objectively. I saw some people giving it a 10/10 because it had no melodrama, which is okay in some cases, but I would rather that this movie have a bunch of melodrama than the multiple flat scenes with awful writing. I think he was trying to be hip in a few scenes but it just fell flat. The movie has a clear aesthetic and tone, and it's pretty clear what he was trying to do. And I applaud the work he put into it. 12 years is a long time to work on a project. But that doesn't change the fact the kid is annoying, nothing interesting ever happens (even though multiple times it seems like it's going to). Another thing I find wrong with it is the fact that it's 3 hours long. Again, nothing wrong with 3 hour movies, in fact I enjoy them more because they usually have a longer and usually more wholesome story (which Boyhood had admittedly). But there were so many points that it could have ended on. There were multiple scenes where I actually thought ""and this is the end I guess, wow that was a great ending"" and then another scene starts. The actual ending itself was actually pretty bad too. They did LSD in a valley or something and then it cuts to black. The car ride to college was a much better place to end. Speaking of which, there were a lot of other things that seemed like they would lead to more interesting things but never did. I won't go into detail in case you still want to slog through it 15 months later. My final beef is that every side character that gets only one scene, or is only in it for a short time is intentionally unlikable, but in a manipulative sort of way. The drunk abusing father, the unencouraging teacher, the ""cool"" older kids that peer pressure, etc. Richard created these two dimensional characters to create the illusion of adversity. To make a sense of drama or progression. That he proved them wrong or something. But as I watched it I felt like he was just throwing cliches at me to try and get me to care. There were other side characters that weren't like that though. Imagine how everyone in a restaurant sees you as an extra in the story of their life. But they were also just two or one dimensional, and rarely got any development. The family (mother, father, kid and sister) were really the only ones with development. The sister was trash, and only there in the end because she had to be, and was probably just the lesser of the awfulness that is child actors at the beginning who auditioned. The kid was as I said before unlikable and annoying. But the parents actually had some depth and the actors did an incredible job with their material. I will end on a quote that I think sums up this movie perfectly: ""This is the most true to life movie that's ever been made when you think about it. When you get to the end you just want to die."" -Jay from Half in the Bag","OCT 7, 2015",2,Drama

Moonlight,"Wanted to see as many 2016 films as possible, especially those that won or were nominated for the big awards. Took me a while to see 'Moonlight', with the controversy it garnered when it was announced for the Best Picture Oscar and the amount of hate it's got here part of me was wary. Finally getting round to seeing 'Moonlight', it turned out that it was more than well worth the while and that the wariness was not needed. 'Moonlight' is not a perfect film and may not have been my personal pick for the Best Picture award (for me that was 'La La Land' though that is not a popular opinion it seems). Truly admired what it set out to do and found it a brave and powerful film, despite what the detractors say there is far more to 'Moonlight's' appeal than politics, sexuality and race (clearly trying to find conspiracy theories and reasons for why a film they dislike is loved by others, without taking into account that the film simply just connected to and resonated with those who liked it). 'Moonlight' does end on an anti-climactic note, some of the last act is a bit rushed. A longer length would have helped as a result, it also would have helped make a couple of events in the first act a little clearer and not so choppy. It may not say much new, despite the ground-breaking concept on paper with the exploration of lives rarely seen on film, and doesn't always have subtlety. Then again it is tackling far from subtle themes and a heavy subject, so that sort of was going to be inevitable. However, 'Moonlight' is an exceptionally well made film. The cinematography and editing are some of the most eye-pleasing and best of that year, and can't find anything to fault the expertly handled direction. The music is cleverly mixed and has haunting power and fluidity. Regarding the writing, it is not perfect, at times as said a little heavy-handed and vague in parts, but it is thought-provoking and handles very ambitious, relevant, important themes with power, truth and (mostly) delicacy. The story makes the most of the three act structure, it's handled simply but not simplistically and also handled cleverly and with passion, honesty and intelligence. Found myself relating quite a lot to and being moved significantly by the story and found the film handled a heavy and sensitive subject matter with a lot of relevance and importance today more than admirably. Can't fault the acting, doing wonders with compellingly real characters and strongly defined character relationships (especially the central one). Much has been made of Maharshala Ali and Naomie Harris and deservedly with two of the best performances that year, Ali especially is extraordinary. It is easy though to overlook Alex R. Hibbert, Trevante Rhodes and Ashton Sanders and one shouldn't, as they are just as worthy (particularly Sanders). Overall, didn't completely blow me away but very well done and with a lot to admire. 8/10 Bethany Cox","MAR 17, 2022",8,Drama

Moonlight,"Moonlight takes the spot for my second favorite movie of all time. The concept/theme is interesting but the way it’s executed is out of this world and makes that concept/theme so much deeper and more engaging. The writing, directing and acting are all great and this is a movie that proves that you don’t need to have a total A-list cast to make a fantastic and Academy award winning movie; the only actor in this movie who I knew before seeing it was Mahershala Ali, who gave a phenomenal performance and deserved the Academy award that he won for his work in the movie. Chiron is a unique and complex character and it’s really engaging to watch how his personality affects him and his relationships with those he cares about as he grows up. The structure of this movie is also really cool, as it’s divided into 3 sections that each detail a part of Chiron’s life and how he changes as he goes from a boy to a teenager to an adult while still remaining the same in many ways. This is a film that showcases that no matter how old you get or how much mental development you go through, you’ll still be the same person in a lot of ways. The way that the movie flows and transitions through these 3 sections is great and doesn’t feel disruptive to it at all or cause any awkward or abrupt moments. Another thing that makes this movie more unique and complex than it may appear at first glance is how the movie is described in a google search. You’ll see it as “**** & lesbian/Drama” or “Drama/LGBT” and a synopsis will talk about falling in love. I definitely agree with the drama, and it’s undeniable that Chiron is a **** character, but this movie isn’t about romance or LGBTQ related themes. It certainly includes them and makes sure we know about them, but Moonlight is really a coming of age story that’s rare and underrepresented in cinema and that’s part of what makes this movie as good as it is. I’m sure that there are people in the real world who have stories similar to that of Chiron and yet we never hear about any of them. Moonlight is a film about stories we don’t normally hear or care about. The struggle that Chiron goes through is a product of his upbringing and the environment that surrounds him throughout his life, and it’s a struggle that I’m sure so many other people will be able to relate to. This movie speaks to and for all of those people, and in that way it’s a fascinating work of art. Via all of this, Moonlight is incredibly realistic and accurate of real world situations, something I always appreciate in a film. This movie is a must-see for people who appreciate the genres that form it’s story and plot and well deserves the Academy award for Best Picture that it won.","AUG 19, 2021",10,Drama

Moonlight,"I'm pretty surprised by how positive this movie has been reviewed. Many of the character relationships make little to no sense based on what is occurring in the movie. This is a dark coming of age tale, but loses much of it's believability early on in the movie. To start, the bullies of the movie recognize the main character as **** long before he himself does, almost making it seem as though because they call him **** he then turns ****. It is hard to care overmuch about the main character as he has maybe 25 lines in the entire movie, and anytime he does talk it's 4-5 word sentences followed by long stretches of silence. I guess this was supposed to be an interesting character trait, but when the movie contains nothing but dialog and the main character doesn't talk it seems like a bit of a problem. It's exacerbated by the fact that every other character in the movie constantly points it out. The best friend/lover is equally confusing throughout the movie. His sexuality is seemingly fluid ranging from dude bro misogyny to handjibbers at the beach. At least the friend/lover was charismatic and for me the only redeeming actor in the movie. Every other character could have been played by anyone, the mom especially lacked presence in the film with the exception of the scene in which she forcibly takes money from her son. Not a bad movie, but it left much to be desired. The music and cinematography were strong, but total lack of likeable characters, and odd character choices felt like it detracted from the any real entertainment value that could have been found here. The biggest problem was the main characters arc, troubled **** kid in broken home beats the **** out of bully, disappears, comes back as a drug peddler. In the interim has not touched another person man or women, comes back and I guess gets back with his childhood hand jibber giver for love ever after?

Moonlight,"I wanted to like Moonlight. Really, I did. But I can't. I don't know what it is about the film but it just frustrates me. I screened this film as part of my research into the representation of sexuality and gender in film, believing that this was a significant work. And it is: the Academy Award for Best Picture winner and one of the most highly rated films on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic. Naturally, with all the praise the film was lavished with, I was excited. When the movie ended I was in a state of confusion. Confusion because when the credits started rolling my first thought was ""Is that it?"". I often like films that are subtle in the way they work and Moonlight is an extremely subtle movie yet at the same time it bears the subtlety of a brick to the face; Moonlight is the equivalent of someone tapping you on the shoulder, punching you and then running away before you have a chance to realise what's happening. The film is too conventional and tries too hard to be experimental with it's simplicity: our protagonist Chiron is met with a number of issues throughout his life which are generic, cliched and frankly uninteresting - people claim that this movie is ""all too real"" but for me it seemed like a shopping list of typical film issues that had all been neatly shoehorned to create the perfect tragic character. The problem I have with this is that a lot of the issues are unresolved by the time the film ends, but perhaps that was the entire point, but then again I stopped caring in the last 10 minutes. You see if you're going to go for a film with deep meaning you have to make one that's actively engaging. (Not that I would consider the film deep, it's more a shallow grave of ideas.) What bothers me most about the film isn't even regarding the film itself but the reviews. It honestly feels as though this film has been lauded by the masses out of fear that to hold a contrarian view would mark you as either a racist or ****. You might read this and think I sound ridiculous but there are existing reviews that criticise this film based purely on its artistic merits, and the people writing those have been attacked for those exact reasons. Heck, I read an article suggesting that Moonlight itself is racist and I'll admit that they brought up some valid arguments. I've glossed over much of the other elements that went into the making of this film and although you may think I'll criticise them, because I do not like the film, you are wrong. The performances are for the most part fantastic, Mahershala Ali in particular was deserving of his Oscar, the film is well-directed and has some great cinematography, the only problem I have is the screenplay and how forced some of the dialogue is. So Moonlight was a great disappointment for me. A film I was excited for but one which ultimately failed to meet my expectations. While there are many brilliant things about this film there is simply one thing that is too significant to prevent the film from being anywhere near a masterpiece. Honestly? They should have let La La Land keep the award.","FEB 12, 2018",6,Drama

Moonlight,"It's been done before, but not by you. Also, I'll be honest and say I didn't really get it. Let me get this out the way first, Moonlight is a well written, well-acted, and well told story about identity in my opinion of course. Now that that's out of the way, I couldn't help but feel I've seen this before. I'll unpack that last statement soon, but first I'll discuss the production quality. The cinematography was very good. The camera was very loose and fluid in a bunch allowing for sweeps, pans, and overall movement that allowed the movie to feel grounded, funny enough. Certain compositions stood out to me, mostly the close-ups of characters where they are centered. The lighting for many interior shots gave certain scenes a dream-like quality to them. The soundtrack was subtle, but the parts of it I loved the absolute most were the multiple renditions of 'Little's Theme' throughout. This beautifully gentle and peaceful piano piece, that starts off tender and shy, then becomes 'Chiron's Theme' and becomes deeper in tone with the same melody, and finally it becomes this confused violin piece in 'Black's Theme'. Each rendition just spoke to what Little was going through in the film, at first he was small and innocent, then growing up, and finally he was confused about who he really is. Licensed music parts were good too, with the first song lyrics we hear in the film being 'Every **** is a star' I felt spoke to partly what this film was trying to say. And the use of Classic Man spoke to what Black was trying to feel for himself. The characters were well written and acted. I genuinely have nothing more to add to that statement. No one really stood out to me, as everyone worked well together I felt. The story was fine too. Once again, that's my genuine take there, nothing more to add. I usually have more to say about these things, but in all honesty, I found Moonlight to be unoriginal and not really anything special. I'll admit that the movies status among people may have tainted my view of the film as I was watching it, but afterwards I tried to separate those expectations and judge the film by its own merit. From my own findings I found a lot of the plot to be contrived and typical. A story about this young boy who is bullied at school (for being ****) with a rough childhood and parents who aren't really there for him, he finds some older person who looks after them and acts a second parent, the boy has a childhood friend who is the only constant good thing for them throughout and who really understands (them) and vice versa, at some point the bullying gets out of hand, and the kid is sent to the principle's office and is reluctant to give up the names of the aggressors out of fear of them, the boy shares some ""romantic"" and tender moment (maybe while smoking and outside) with the childhood friend (and maybe looses their virginity). Even the ending where they meet up again int the future and things seem like they haven't changed between them. The storyline regarding Little/Chiron/Blacks sexuality was also very bare bones to be honest. He's **** and shy, gets bullied, but this one guy who seems like a real Chad is the only one who he's really cool with in some way and then they stare into each others eyes, kiss, then the Chad boy tries to hide his true feelings by doing something with the bullies that he doesn't want to, but does because he has a reputation to uphold. I just feel like I've seen this before, I don't know. And I know I'm not providing any exact evidence of movies I found to be similar, and it's honestly because I'm blanking on them, but I just think of every one of those YA type movies like Lady Bird, or any John Greene book adaptation. Something along those lines. And once again, I had the expectations for the film, but even then, I never watched it thinking, ""Oh this scene must be why this won and Oscar."", or ""I can't wait for the part that people say is the best part of Moonlight."" etc. I just watched it. The movies good, but funnily enough I just found it shallower than was promised.","FEB 2, 2023",6,Drama
Moonlight,"There is, somehow, an interesting story here, as well as some good acting. There are also some good scenes (particularly those involving his ""adopted"" father). However, the cinematography and direction bear resemblance to the average home movie. There is also a huge gap in the story between an incident that happens in high school and Chiron as an adult. What passions does Chiron have other than the fact that he is ****? What does he even do for a living as an adult? Most of these characters are stereotypes rather than well-drawn human beings.","JAN 8, 2017",5,Drama

It's a solid first film, and I can't wait to see what the writer and director do next! My biggest complaint is the performance of Naomi Harris. Her character is so unbelievable that it really took me out of the film. It wouldn't have bothered me so much if her character hadn't played such a big role.

There have been similar films such as this which go through a boy's life as they grow up in a rather messed-up part of the world/family; examples include ""City of God"", ""Do The Right Thing"" and ""Gran Torino"", yet this film is nowhere close to the aura and sheer beauty of these films.","JAN 27, 2017",6,Drama

Because I could not find a single white or any other race people, even in the background. The happy parts are, it is surprisingly a very interesting theme. I loved the storyline. The three phases of a man's life. How things around us can influence to build a personality. Sometimes in a good sense, but according to this film, there are some dramatic turns. Though the end was very simple, but I liked the first episode. It had potential to be a message film, but the later parts turned differently. Most importantly realistic narrative. More like it is about the life cycle. Feels like a short and suburban version of 'Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter and Spring'. All the actors were so good. The screenplay was adapted from a book. Looks like it's a breakthrough for the director. I hope he keeps up the momentum and gives us the best products in the future. This film is not for everyone, mainly because of the theme. Initial parts were okay, but the latter developments were unexpected. It is one of the good films of the year, not the best. 7/10","FEB 25, 2017",6,Drama

The 1st & 2nd acts felt so organic, it presents situations that people may feel related to, because it was very well made and close to real life situations. Once the 3rd act starts, there is a little ""situation"" involving the encounter of two characters. That ""situation"" felt too unreal, & cheap. It's something that just doesn't happen in real life, and felt forced so that these two characters meet each other. That organic feeling from the first two acts just felt destroyed by that 3rd act and made me feel disconnected & angry by a long time.

Lightyear,"This is an enjoyable watch. A nice story featuring Buzz in the film role Andy from Toy Story first saw him in, that led to him wanting the famous Buzz toy featured in said Toy Story films. It has some interesting twists although its not greatly memorable in and of itself. It felt a bit like a long TV show, rather than a particularly good, large scale film as such. It explains the origins of the famous 'to **** beyond' catchphrase. I thought the inclusion of a cat character was a bit random - its kind of sweet but also, as I say, random. I wouldn't say this is great but its not a bad film either - its a pretty ok, reasonably good film of its type, I reckon. I'd recommend it if it sounds of interest, yes.","AUG 14, 2022",7,Drama

But the truth is that it delivers, there is action, comedy and good characters (you can see the gross budget from afar, the animation and designs are very beautiful). The kiss scene is just a peak, nothing to be horrified about. The issue is that many people said that this was not a movie for children and they talk about a progressive agenda, but the truth is that they are second nature and nothing important. It contributes nothing, changes nothing and generates nothing. It is just a show of affection between two individuals who love each other. For me, if you go in thinking that you are going to see a bad movie, it will end up looking like a bad movie. Just go, look at it, enjoy it (if you can) and draw your own conclusions.","SEP 8, 2022",7,Drama
Lightyear,"Lightyear is a very good film. It's not great but it is a very well crafted Pixar movie with some stunning animation. The level of animation displayed here is absolutely incredible. The footage of the landscapes as well as the facial expressions of Buzz and other characters are so realistic it is kind of scary. Chris Evans does a decent job of replacing Tim Allen and after a while his voice basically became Buzz. I wished there was more of an emotional punch but that relationship with Alisha really got me. The plot is actually rather complicated and some kids might not be able to understand what the heck is going on in the last act of the film. Lightyear in some ways feels like one of the Star Trek films. Michael Giacchino's score feels very patriotic and heroic which I really enjoyed. The 'Infinite MOEtion' cue is stunning. Overall though, it is really well done and entertaining although parents might appreciate this more than kids.","SEP 1, 2022",8,Drama

This Pixar film is easily one of the top 5 I've seen, and I've seen all of them except for Soul. Maybe top 3. Let's start with the good. It's a beautiful film with great direction and the pacing was great. Now the **** was a little predictable knowing who the villain was going to be and the villain changing his tune. But other than that, I really enjoyed it. Lastly, I guess some people were upset that Tim Allen wasn't Buzz. This is completely idiotic since in reality most talking toys don't have the actual voice of the actor. Chris Evans has a very ""Buzz"" voice and it worked well.

Unfortunately, the film gets lost in the middle and towards the end it gets a bit boring but it's easy to watch, mainly because the film is seriously beautiful and I don't even know how to create such realistic lighting in an animation.

Pointless film when it has nothing to do with the REAL Buzz Lightyear who is actually a deranged toy - that is his USP. Poor and predictable lead character surrounded by even more dreary characters. The usual political inserts (not a fan , even if they align with my own views) that have no business in a film of this kind (or at least what it is trying to be). At least I managed to stay awake, unlike the Turning Red experience (soooo bad). Sox was the only high point although he was more like a character from Looney Tunes in relation to what he pulled out of his bag of tricks. It's just a shame that Soul wasn't their last film, the last two would hardly be regarded swansongs.","SEP 20, 2022",5,Drama

Lightyear,"All of Pixar’s films that they released on Disney+ should have been released in theaters. This however feels like it actually should have been released on Disney+. Very disappointing in my eyes but it’s not as bad as some people claim it is. It’s got elements of the Pixar charm with a VERY fun side character in Sox. Sox is honestly my favorite part of the movie and the only character that made me laugh when the movie wanted me to laugh plus the animation here is great. The film looks gorgeous the entire time especially the space scenes. While I do miss Tim Allen as Buzz, Chris Evans does do a good job at making the character feel similar but adding his own charm to it. None of the performances here are bad but the characters other than Buzz aren’t very good. They have very little to almost no character development and are kind of just blank slates standing around waiting for development that just never comes. I can only name maybe one slight personality trait for the side characters but other than that, I couldn’t tell you what their goals or motivations are. The only side character that I liked is written out at the beginning of the movie after a great little fast forward in time scene. The story and villain are honestly the weakest parts for me. The story is surprisingly bland and basic for Pixar standards. It feels half baked and half formed. The foundations are there but the actual structure itself is weak and wobbly. The villain goes into spoiler territory so I won’t say much but it’s BAD. The villain honestly **** and the reveal about the villain is just the worst. We don’t get any development with the villain and they are just there at points even though they are screaming that they are important. Even the music from the legend Michael Giacchino feels underwhelming as well. Honestly, you can probably pass on this as this doesn’t really contribute that much to the Toy Story franchise at large.","JUN 25, 2022",5,Drama

Lightyear,"As a diehard fan of the original Toy Story movies, I can see how this Buzz character became ""Toy Buzz"". this movie has some wonderful visual callbacks to the original films but lacks in-character. The side cast is terrible, not funny and generic. The ""Plot Twist"" doesn't add up with the canon of the original series, and as a fan, it's weird for me. I will stick to the ""Buzz Lightyear Of Star Command"" tv show. It's an enjoyable ride, but nothing more.","JUN 18, 2022",6,Drama
Lightyear,"The movie is forgettable and does not feel like the kind of thing that would have set the world on fire in 1993. For me at least, the conceit that the movie was released in 1993 is where it falls apart since it relies on science fiction tropes that evolved more recently regarding time travel (especially in a post-Back to the Future world). Buzz doesn't really have much of an arc either.","AUG 4, 2022",6,Drama
Lightyear,"A Buzz Lightyear film that wasn’t really a Buzz Lightyear film. While the animation and effects were very impressive, the storytelling fell through in a major way. They were definitely able to take some elements from the Toy Story series and transition it to this film to create parallels between the toy Buzz and the “real” Buzz, yet the overall story heavily derails from what Buzz at his core is; an action hero. Instead of the story being about a grand adventure or stopping a universe-ending evil like Zurg, the story instead resorts to being an overly drawn out version of the “Up” opening sequence. It may have worked with different setups and characters, but not with a character that’s supposed to be an action hero. I get that this film was heavily inspired by the pandemic; with the shutdowns, time moving differently, and everything seemingly passing by as if it never happened, and that can make for a good story. They just chose the wrong setting for it in my opinion.","JUN 20, 2022",6,Drama
Lightyear,"If it weren't for that dumb irrelevant text crawl at the beginning and the fact that Toy Story has already established lore about the character of Buzz Lightyear, I honestly would've accepted the choices made in this film. Ignoring that, the film is a pretty straightforward and fun adventure film that I can definitely see kids enjoying. It's got the Pixar charm of amazing and beautiful animation with a stellar score from Michael Giacchino. The voice over work is okay, there are some scenes where I feel the actors aren't properly conveying the emotion of the scene well. It also suffers from a weak story, bad writing and not very likeable characters. It's not as bad as people make it out to be but it's definitely not as stellar as it should be.","JUL 21, 2022",5,Drama
Lightyear,"As with most other Pixar offerings, ""Lightyear"" serves up a visually resplendent feast of solid storytelling and clean character work. Where the rubber really meets the road, however, is in this movie's relation to its source material. A kind of ""Kill-Bill-to-Pulp-Fiction"" dynamic is at work here, so to speak, with ""Lightyear"" representing a piece of media within another piece of media — that being ""Toy Story."" Tragically, what should be the movie's biggest selling point ends up actually being its most substantive issue, with so much of its attempts at being its own thing ultimately flying in the face of the world in which it spawned from. Whether one looks at the retcons employed or the narrative inconsistencies therein, fans of the ""Toy Story"" trilogy may find themselves getting frustrated in their attempts at connecting this to the other films. Again, it's a real shame, because I think everything's decently executed. I just find the reasons behind the existentiality of the film to be a little weak overall.","JUN 19, 2022",6,Drama
Lightyear,"Misguided, origin story is expertly animated as always by the Pixar team, but is so 'derivative' of so many previous anime science fiction films that you can see the story miles ahead. The fact is that if only the Pixar team simply made a straight forward space adventure film , then it would have been more accepted by audiences. Instead, it feels like they have aspirations to make a hard core sci-fi anime, that is shoehorned into this 'franchise'. People are expecting a straight forward origin story for Buzz, and not a subversion of expectations that is being presented here. Not a bad watch, but still a disappointment.","JUL 14, 2022",6,Drama
Lightyear,"Right up front, this movie states that the action figure of Buzz Lightyear owned by Andy in the Toy Story movies was inspired by this adventure. Chris Evans voices the Space Ranger as he ventures on an intergalactic mission that leaves him and his crew stranded on a strange planet. The story follows relatively typical space challenges, so it's up to the writing and characters to set it apart. The writing is seldom clever or original and the characters are scrappy but not really funny (with the exception of the robot cat Sox voiced by Peter Sohn). The outer space animation and sci-fi visuals are grand and attractive. Those expecting to see the original franchise echoed in this origin story will not find the stylized style or rollocking humor of those classics. It's an acceptable adventure for kids that lacks much of the charm of its predecessors. NOTE: There's been some uproar over the depiction of a lesbian couple, but I applaud Pixar for taking the stand for normality.","JUN 27, 2022",6,Drama
Lightyear,"Lightyear starts off pretty strong, the first 30 minutes or so are entertaining and the time travel is intersting, however after that, the movie really goes dowhill as the unfunny and annoying sidekicks join the mission, followed by a confusing and borderline nonscensical **** always the movie is gorgeous in some places, but that doesn't save this mess of a movie.","JUL 31, 2022",4,Drama

Lightyear,"It Didn't Feel Like A Buzz Lightyear Movie. The Buzz in this movie doesn't resemble the character in the Toy Story Movies and BLoSC show in characterization. But my main gripes are in the abandonment of continuity. Buzz is introduced in the original Toy Story movie saying ""I protect the Galaxy from the Evil Emperor Zurg, sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance!"", which this movie doesn't line up with AT ALL. And Toy Story 2 establishes Zurg as Buzz's father, as a narrative pastiche, which again, is abandoned. And none of the movie is in line with the canon established by Buzz Lightyear of Star Command. It was a well-executed fan-fiction, but not even close to resembling what I (or, I'd wager /most/ BLoSC fans) wanted. If you switch out the names and changed Buzz's face, it would be... fine. As a standalone sci-fi movie, it was watchable. But my disappointment outweighs that by a lot.","JUN 27, 2022",4,Drama

In fact, I think the movie would have been better without that reference. Because in terms of scifi story with time travel, it is pretty good. If certain parts are repetitive, it is more an effect of the story. The cat is a fun addition. This is a Pixar movie, so you know you get solid visuals. Good action. The music was a mix bag for me. The sounds effects were strong and I had no problem with the voices over. I give the movie 68%. Disney made a big mistake by using Buzz instead of a new hero. They tried a cheap cashing with nostalgia and alienated Pixar's fan. Do yourself a favour and watch the movie by thinking that Buzz isn't there.

The Wolf of Wall street is full of chaotic fun about a freshly married business man who goes from a good husband to his supportive wife, to a psychotic drug addicted maniac that sleeps with every girl around the block and you truly see how he develops into the biggest antagonist that you feel uneasy cheering for. It's a long film yes, but there is not one dull moment where you'll be bored; one second you think Jordan is about to change and it's all about to end peacefully, but everyone is fooled by all the out of nowhere stunts he will pull on us.","DEC 8, 2020",9,Drama

The Wolf of Wall Street,"The cinematic masterpiece, 'The Wolf of Wall Street,' is a compelling recommendation for discerning viewers. Although its extended duration, initially surpassing a daunting four-hour mark before editing, and its liberal use of profanity may give pause to certain audiences, I contend that these elements are integral to fully immersing oneself in the film's immersive narrative. The film's intention is unequivocally to provide a captivating and enjoyable experience, a goal it undoubtedly achieves.

The Wolf of Wall Street,"I didn't care for the characters, but I damn did have a great time watching 'The Wolf of Wall Street'. It's absolutely nuts, and I mean that in a positive way. Leonardo DiCaprio simply never puts an acting foot wrong, this is the sixth film I've seen of his and I love (fwiw: all 9/10+) them all. Phenomenal actor! He is outstanding here as Jordan Belfort, the guy this film is based upon. As noted, I didn't really ever care for Jordan but DiCaprio makes it impossible not to enjoy watching events throughout. Jonah Hill (Donnie) comes in with a very good performance, the type of which I hadn't previously seen from him; closest being, in terms of quality, 'Moneyball'. Margot Robbie, meanwhile, isn't easy to forget as Naomi. Though none of the following standout big, it's pleasant to see Jon Bernthal, Matthew McConaughey and Jon Favreau, among others, appear. The almost three hour run time, aside from a couple of moments, goes by fairly quickly. A big reason for that is the sheer bonkers nature of the plot, which goes in so many different directions it's impressive. It doesn't, as I've already mentioned, breed likeability for the characters but I definitely had a fun time watching it all unfold. I guess it depends on what you, as a viewer, prefer. I got the desired amount of entertainment.","MAR 12, 2021",9,Drama
The Wolf of Wall Street,"The film, directed by Martin Scorsese and starring Leonardo DiCaprio, was a thrilling portrayal of the wild and debaucherous life of Jordan Belfort, a stockbroker who rose to fame in the 1990s. DiCaprio's performance was outstanding - he truly embodied the persona of Belfort, making him both charismatic and despicable at the same time. The supporting cast, including Jonah Hill and Margot Robbie, were also fantastic, bringing depth and nuance to their roles.

His range is on full display on ""The Wolf Of Wall Street"" I'm absolutely certain that this film alone has inspired hundreds if not thousands to pursue a stockbroker career. Thank you Martin Scorsese. The film is engaging, funny, and even at times like the ending, thought provoking. Scorsese does a phenomenal job highlighting what life was probably like at Stratton Oakmont, a real company that was lower than pond scum and scammed the hell out of thousands. The story of Belfort is also incredible and well complimented by Leos phenomenal acting. Can we also get a nod for Jonah Hill and Margot? They acted the hell out of their roles! This is the best acting I've seen in a film hands down. The dedication to the characters by the cast is unmatched by any other film in the last ten or so years. The acting, scenery, music, real story, and environment make this a cult classic. Thank you Scorsese.

The Wolf of Wall Street,"Jordan Belfort's life in a way that only Martin Scorsese can tell! The narrative here flows very well, and with each scene we become more excited to know where everything will lead. The characters are very charismatic and the cast, in addition to containing several Hollywood names, is very well cast, with a clear emphasis on Leonardo DiCaprio, who gets into character and faces several difficult scenes and Margot Robbie, who goes far beyond a body beautiful, given his performance in the last arc. The film features several comical scenes, ""plays"" with several serious themes, but without encouraging them, which requires precise dexterity on the part of the direction. The photography, soundtrack, set design and costumes are on point, which makes its identity even more unique. In conclusion, some people may have failed to understand the importance of the work and ended up misjudging it. All we have left is precisely the reflection of what is being watched, because some themes are still present in society, and there is no point in pretending as if they did not exist, especially when it comes to the financial market, which is psychological suicide.","MAY 17, 2020",9,Drama

The Wolf of Wall Street,"As an investment man myself, I find Wolf of Wallstreet extremely disrespectful to day traders. And that’s why I love this movie. You see, unlike other movies which require extensive knowledge of the stock market to really fully enjoy, Wolf Of Wallstreet is a tale of drugs, sex and honour (except that last part). And everyone loves drugs and sex (this is purely hypothetical mom). First, the characters of WOW are so vibrant. I constantly find myself laughing at their adorably hilarious moments, snorting white powder, doing the devils tangle and most of the time both. And the rich problems they face are just so stupid in nature that it makes the film so entertaining. Laundering money (clearly never heard of Crown Casino), cheating on their wives without them knowing, having an hour minute delay before the lemons kick in, these characters are just stupid fun. They are also emotional though. We see a drug fuelled Jorden tear his family apart when faced with losing his child and wife, when faced with death, Jorden wants to die on drugs – we even see him try to save his closest friend Donnie by alerting him that he was wired when snitching to the feds. That said, Wolf of Wall Street’ story is good but nothing revolutionary. Basing itself of Jorden Belfort’s time, manipulating the stock market and running a penny stock scam, it’s clear to any investment orientated person that WOW is not a movie directly about that. It’s sensationalised. You’re not going to learn anything about stocks, other than how corrupt the big players on wall street can be. The Story is complete though with an ending that has reasonable closure and couldn’t have been done a lot better. When it comes to cinematography, the movie doesn’t do anything too special. There are no crazy pan shots, nothing too high tech. They do a decent job of the huge orgy scenes and special effects when the characters are taking drugs. Other then that, they maybe could have done a bit more in the boat scene and used more expensive shots to really sell that multi, multi-millionaire feeling. Overall definitely a favourite movie of mine but from a critical perspective probably about a 7-8, as while in terms of purely technical aspects, it’s really like a 6, it gains some points for being entertaining and highly pop cultural.","DEC 22, 2021",8,Drama

Jonah Hill is great, and steady through out.

The Wolf of Wall Street,"I really don't know what to think about this movie: it has incredible actors that deliver flawless performances, but it made me feel very disgusted with myself. At some point I felt like I was literally watching a porno film for the amount of nudity present (both full frontal female and male and not to mention both hetero and **** sexual orgies just randomly). Don't get me wrong though, the women are gorgeous and you would probably do the same as Leonardo's character if you were in his position. There's also A LOT of drugs. SO DO NOT BRING KIDS TO THIS MOVIE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. The question you ask yourself while walking out is was all this extreme content really necessary to illustrate the simple theme of how greed and corruption destroy people? This movie was definitely engineered in order to shock and trust me it succeeded, but left me very startled at the same time. The script itself is very well written and it is probably one of Leonardo's best performances to date, but the movie content itself just gets in the way most of the time. However, Dicaprio's speeches in front of his entire staff are quite incredible. Overall, as I mentioned before, I really don't know what to make of this movie.

The Wolf of Wall Street,"The moral of the story is unclear and the running time is self-indulgent. There may be an underlying message of ""everyone is corrupt"" or the ""this is America"" line might be the significant moral, but overall this film has no real value. Essentially one hour of the three hours of running time is devoted to shots of debauchery, naked women, sex, drugs, more drugs, and lavish lifestyles, plus more naked women. The plethora of ""filler"" content made the film seem to go on forever as I often found myself looking at my watch. Obviously, Jordan Belfort sold his story rights to this film and a lot of the debauchery actually happened so you may say ""but it isn't unrealistic."" And you're likely completely correct. However, the real question may not be the realistic nature of the story, but whether a story like this deserves to be told - all at the financial benefit of the criminal. He may have said he's giving all of his profit to those who he harmed in doing all the acts this film glorifies, but the FBI says he actually has failed to give much of anything of the $1M plus he's made off of the rights alone to anyone but himself. As for the film as a stand alone: The characters range from unappealing to appalling. The plot is schizophrenic. The moral of the story seems to be immoral behaviour has no real consequence. The running time could have been 3 minutes and I would have benefited just as much from this film. If you like watching a 2000s hip-hop music video staring white guys, mixed with soft-core porn for 3 hours - watch this film. Otherwise - skip this film and find something useful to do with 3 hours of your life.","JAN 12, 2014",4,Drama
The Wolf of Wall Street,"The biggest issue with this movie, which knocked it down from a movie that could have been an 8 or 9 to a 4, was that it was far too long. I really enjoyed the first hour or so of the movie, from Belfort's introduction to the brokerage industry through the creation of Stratton Oakmont and their decision to move away from selling penny stocks solely to lower and middle class folks and instead trying to create relationships (and sell those stocks) to wealthier clients. I enjoyed the initial showing of the opulence, fraud, and craziness that was the Stratton Oakmont at least of Belfort's characterization. But then that portion of the film went on... and on... and on... and it added nothing to the understanding of the characters. I got it at 90 minutes into the film: these were bad men who were willing to do awful things to make themselves as wealthy as possible. The continued at great length portrayals of their awfulness did not make me think they were more awful, but instead took me out of the film and made me so bored that, by the time the action actually picked up again (when Belfort realized he was under investigation, his meeting with the FBI agents, and his move to get his money out of the US), I just couldn't get back into it. The movie could have easily cut a half hour off the run time and I would have felt it would have ended with a better result. For example, I felt the entire IPO Day scene was unnecessary. We already knew Donnie was a jerk, the fish eating/firing scene added nothing. We already knew that, at least according to Belfort, Stratton Oakmont viewed him as a something akin to a cult leader. We didn't need him herding the sheep after Madden tried to speak. That scene also seemed the most hollow and untrue to me in the film. I also think the film could have been better had they done some more research BEYOND Belfort's memoir, and didn't just essentially present Belfort's memoir as fact. I would have found it much more interesting to have seen Belfort's rendition juxtaposed with what others (who said the environment was much more tame) said. Other point: too much was focused on the Naomi relationship. It was clear from moment one that she liked Belfort solely for his money and the lifestyle he could provide. They didn't need to treat it like it was some crazy reveal, like we didn't get that he was delusional about their relationship. I didn't get pulled back into the movie until the very last scene, where Belfort was doing the sales motivational speech, and you got pulled back into what made his group able to pull off the sort of fraud they did: they were able to convince buyers that they needed something that they did not actually need. Short version: could have been a great movie, had a great start, but was at least a half hour too long and stuck too close to Belfort's telling as opposed to trying to provide some more objective truth.","DEC 29, 2014",4,Drama

The Wolf of Wall Street,"Well, Maybe you would like to go and see this one for its appealing sex, drugs and money promises. However, the film is intriguingly skillful. It uses Scorsese's mastery and that of course along with an extremely able line up of actors and crew in virtually all aspects of film making except one. The question what does the film tell? To make a long story short, it basically is a sales pitch. Scorsese sells us - no matter if we are hungry-for-success-sales-persons or such that feel disadvantaged by the ongoings of financial crisis or stock market in general seeking for insight or if we just want to know what's behind it - he sells us the life style of this super-dooper-bigwig-broker probably as good as it gets. It's a train of thrill and excitement going uphill and there is a sense of tweaked decency in context of either keeping the game going or not being true to oneself. Having said that, the film is based on the book of the very broker, Jordan Belfort and, thus, serves as a commercial for it, not mentioning the probability of royalties paid to Mr. Belfort along with the film. Hence, the film reflects Mr. Belfort's perspective. A salesman who proficiently peddles his story and along with it his view of the world. The insight material and sadly the film making art too chiefly serves as bait to catch our attention. The man behind this broker's features remains in the dark. There may be a lot of so called private matters, nonetheless, when it comes to questions of Belfort's identity the film draws a blank. Nothing. What drives him? Given the vehicle nature of money, the mystery prevails about where he wants it to take him. So it is cut down to a fast ride with nowhere to go. That can be fun, sure. But a three hour movie of the world's most celebrated film maker? I don't know. Why could Belfort go so far away from himself? Why do only external limits seem to have an effect in his world, where and when and how did he loose touch with seemingly all of his inner values, feelings? Such an obviously empty person is hard to bear, despite the excellent performance of Leonardo Di Caprio. So isn't there any human left inside this broker-dummy? The film doesn't tell. Even when Belfort finally hits rock bottom, how does he deal with real life, his poor past, relatives, friends, loneliness? Well the film doesn't tell. It's cut to tennis in the joint, and cut to a continuous selling career. In this respect, the film, this form of the American Dream without any inner cultural, emotional response, even seemingly proposing the utter irrelevance of such things, unwillingly, is a horror film. I do not want to spoil your movie night, nevertheless, I have the feeling it's not necessary to embellish Mr. Belfort's memoirs any further. So, go see it if you must, it can be fun, then again, you might as well save the money for a rainy day.","JAN 25, 2014",4,Drama
The Wolf of Wall Street,"In a movie about the excesses of Wall street brokers in the 1990s ""the Wolf Of Wall Street"" is excessive in all aspects starting with a movie that, running at 3 hours, could have easily been cut by an hour. You will see at least 3-4 scenes more than you need to showing the excess of drugs whether cocaine, Quaaludes or whatever else is on hand. After one scene of fellatio it is almost quarantined that there will be a dozen more. If you miss that full frontal nude scene--women only, of course--just wait a few minutes as there are so many repeats of the scene, using different women, over the three hours you aren't really missing anything. Whether it be orgies of sex or luxury or curse words it almost makes the story meaningless. It does leave the question why a man who owns a 170 foot yacht wouldn't own his own jet or at least rent one to go to Las Vegas but then the excessive orgy on the plane wouldn't have the same outcome. It is one of the many missteps in this film. ""The Wolf Of Wall Street"" is based on the book, and true story, by Jordan Belfort who made his fortune during the 1990s when the stock market made millionaires of many young men. Terence Winter wrote the screenplay and Martin Scorsese directed the film working with Leonardo DiCaprio for the fifth time. DiCaprio plays his second rich man this year, after starring as Gatsby, but Jordan Belfort is more interested in himself than he is in a woman or women, though he has sex with many of them. He also has 2 slapstick scenes, one with Jonah Hill, that shows his comedic talent and he is much more relaxed in this film than he has been in awhile. This is one of his better performances though he too has excessive, unnecessary scenes and goes a little overboard here and there. Jonah Hill, as Belfort's best friend and business partner, gets too hammy here and there to raise the empathy of the audience to accept the fact that he is not a 'bad' person. Kyle Chandler plays the FBI man who doesn't seem capable of a smile. The women in the film are there to play the wives, mothers, girlfriends and hookers. Would you accept Rob Reiner as DiCaprio's father? He does a good job as does Jean Dujardin, Jon Favreau and Jon Bernthal. With ""Magic Mike"", ""Mud"", ""Dallas Buyers Club"" Matthew McConaughey adds the cherry to the top of his winning acting streak in ""The Wolf Of Wall Street"" playing Mark Hanna, a very successful Wall street broker who seems to have invented excessiveness. His role calls for him to be over the top and he takes it just far enough. As in most Scorsese movies all the production values are first rate except for the editing in this one. It seems as if the director was rushed and the picture was being released before he finished his job. Whether he would have cut the movie and removed a lot of the excessive excessivenes, if not by an hour at least by 30 minutes, hopefully he will when it comes out on DVD or the viewer can fast forward through all the repetitions.","DEC 24, 2013",4,Drama

I didn't mind, because that is how our super star, Leo Dicaprio plays with a delicious appetite. Every other word may be and at times, I wanted to leave because after 300 uses of ****ing---it loses emphasis. (506 **** uses) There is an important message here. The moral errosion, the twisted deceit and the overwhelming lack of a solid plot, this is what is out there in the world. Especially in the US. Now, as for my rating of six, I did not love the movie. I thought it had its pros and cons. For starters, cut the sex scenes down, trim down the use of **** (which I am not offended by, but it definitely loses emphasis) and show if Belfort was in any way full of remorse. The second half of the picture is better, gaining personal ground and...well,the whole point was to share this ridiculous story, to batter our minds with a genuine question of ""why?"". My feelings are somewhat mixed. Some scenes are too long when you get th point, entertaining here and there, and it never fails to show you. I am not a prude. I just think it went over the top, which is what is should have done, but there is something about WOWS that I couldn't connect to. If you're debating whether or not to see it, please do. There is a lot of mixed reaction on here, and especially in the theatre. Cheers.","DEC 30, 2013",6,Drama
The Wolf of Wall Street,This is supposed to be a comedy? I saw this as a sad cautionary tale against self indulgent pathetic hedonistic depraved lifestyles. At the 50 minute mark yeah it more than made it's point already. Another 2 hours to wrap this all up? Not sure I am going to make it to the end?,"SEP 4, 2023",4,Drama
The Wolf of Wall Street,"I am a gigantic Scorsese fan. I go back to Mean Streets. There is no problem with the direction and the acting is top notch, especially Jonah Hill who keeps getting better with each performance. It is a true adaptation of Belfort's novel. The pace can be electrifying at times, so good you forget the 3 hour running time. Cinematically, it has subtle moments of genius. So why a mediocre review? Personal prejudice with the subject matter. While watching this movie, you wait for redemption or at least true punishment. You expect Jake LaMotta to live a sad life, Henry Hill to crumble and Joe Pesci was doomed in both Goodfellas and Casino. They were satisfying endings because in the moral mind of the audience, they reaped what they had sown. I don't believe I am spoiling anything when I say Belfort has not really been given, what most of our recently recession minds would consider, a gigantic cross to bear. I believe the mixed reviews you are seeing have a lot to do with the time of release. Most people won't get past the "" These are the clowns that killed the economy"" feeling. The Wolf comes at you hard and doesn't let up. It is a spot-on take of the excess of boiler room bandits. Movie making wise, Scorsese remains a master and his muse DiCaprio brilliant. Another time and another place, maybe I would enjoy it. For me, it was too exhausting. It was excess on the excess. I know it was real to the core, I have met some of the characters. These are empty people. I guess I am just at that stage in life where I want to escape when I go to the movies. The Wolf is great film making, but it is also a horrendous story about horrendous people.","JAN 14, 2014",4,Drama
The Wolf of Wall Street,"Very shallow movie. With a very simplistic, tiresome plot. If you can call it a plot that is. Guy does illegal things, makes a lot of money, lives in debauchery. FBI catches on and then eventually strikes a deal with him. That's basically it. Other than Dicaprio's performance and a few funny scenes, there isn't much to recommend here. One would think Scorcese and Dicaprio would want to aim higher at this point in their careers.","MAR 19, 2014",6,Drama
The Wolf of Wall Street,"Wolf of Wall Street is one of my top 3 picks for most over-rated movie of the year (after Inside Llewyn Davis and Fruitvale Station). It’s a portrayal of Wall Street in the 1980’s. If you were alive and over 18 back then you already know this was a time of excess, immorality and corruption. Scorsese presents all this in truly over-the-top fashion, while offering no insight or enlightenment about any of it. At 3 hours, the movie is way, way too long. It drags, in part, because several scenes are repeated over and over. The movie also borrows heavily from previous Scorsese movies, especially Goodfellas, and you may find yourself saying, “I’ve seen this before.” What Wolf lacks in originality, Scorsese tries to make up for through excess. Despite lots of beautiful naked women, Scorsese amps the level of cursing, drug use and orgies to the point where it actually becomes boring and monotonous. Impossible, you say? I wish! Still want to see this move, but need an excuse? Thinking of playing the “my girlfriend is a Leonardo DiCaprio fan” card? Don’t, she’s going to be disappointed, too. Leo’s not very sexy when he’s on Quaaludes (frequently) or when he’s repeatedly cheating on his wives (constantly). Whether you’re male or female, it’s hard to feel much affinity with DiCaprio’s character (Jordan Belfort) and DiCaprio’s acting, while physical in nature (think Matthew Perry-The Whole Nine Yards), isn’t compelling. Jonah Hill’s portrayal of Donnie Azoff provides some laughs, but ultimately his character isn’t very likeable either. The movie is so uninspiring the only thoughts it provokes are along the lines of, “If I had that much money, there’s no way I would have screwed things up so badly.” This movie is for hard-core Scorsese fans only.","FEB 6, 2014",5,Drama
The Wolf of Wall Street,"A few of my all time favorite films came from Scorsese. His track record is remarkable. But this film is another story. Yes, remarkable acting. Several remarkable scenes. In spite of this I found myself board, board, board. The repetition of unfortunate behavior, making the same point over and over, the three hour stretch of waiting for the story to evolve, several absurd scenes lending nothing to the content, did I say boring? Never thought I'd hear those words coming from me about a Scorsese film. Save your money and time on this one. There are too many other terrific films to see. Or stay home and watch Gangs of New York, Hugo, or Good Fellas. All worth watching over and over. I won't watch The Wolf of Wall Street again.","DEC 31, 2013",5,Drama
The Wolf of Wall Street,"""The Wolf of Wall Street"" 10 Scale Rating: 6.5 (Decent) ... The Good: DiCaprio was absolutely amazing and deserving of his Oscar nomination. Jonah Hill has really come a long way as an actor and was great as well. The cast all around deserved accolades. The story itself was interesting and Scorsese grabs your interest five minutes in. The Bad: It is way too long and contains way too much filler. The film is about excess and I get that, but there were far too many scenes depicting it. It felt like of the three hours the movie takes to complete, two of them were lengthy sex, alcohol and drugs binges. That fact severely limited how good the film could be.","NOV 12, 2014",6,Drama

The Wolf of Wall Street,"Had great hopes going in as I love these kind of self-made man movies with for better or worse endings, but felt the storytelling in ""Wolf"" rambled on loosely like an elderly relative getting carried away with less important details of a story from days gone by. No tightness to the direction whatsoever and felt very little connection to any of the characters, not because of any morality reasons but most seemed just simply underdeveloped and uninteresting. This movie was done in the style of Goodfellas and seeing this just made me appreciate even more how amazing that film is. For example DiCaprio occasionally ""breaks character"" to talk to the audience as narrator (a la Ray Liotta's character). In Goodfellas this to me was striking in the moments and way he would break dialogue, in this film it just felt bland and could care less who the character was talking to. Also a good chunk of the movie deals with the his world falling apart around him but felt little empathy or urgency surrounding it. Would I normally compare any movie to one such as Goodfellas, no. And I still don't hold it to the same standard but when it's made by the same guy who is clearly trying to do a modern day version of it, I thought it felt way short.","JAN 11, 2014",4,Drama
The Wolf of Wall Street,"The Wolf of Wall Street was really disappointing and I'm a big fan of Martin Scorsese. I mean the movie is fun and catches you for a while, but after two hours seeing nothing more but drugs abuse and undiscriminated sex activity it becomes boring. The same message of excess could be transmitted with a quarter or less of what is shown in the film. When the protagonist finally is crushed by his lifestyle you expect the most amazing and genius part of a classic Scorsese's picture, the fall of the character until his destruction. However this thing does not occur at anytime; its true that he lost important things but there is nothing more. In that sense this film is not like his other ones, for example Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Goodfellas and The Departed. That enormous learning about life does not fit within this story and that's a shame because it could. What saves the movie is DiCaprio performance, although he never gives a bad one; the edition is marvelous as always and all the scenarios that are used are amazing.","FEB 17, 2014",5,Drama
The Wolf of Wall Street,"Ignore reviews that have very low ratings. They know nothing about this industry and assume that their opinion makes some difference. There is much drug and sex action in this film so if that is not with you, don't see it. If you want to see what it was really like and can deal with drugs, sex, and alcohol and the truth about the times in this business, see it. I did this very type of thing for about 30 years starting in 1984 for The then largest Merrill and moved up to the Swiss banks like UBS eventually. i did get licensed and knew many people that only wanted to make for themselves and they did. The pressure to ""smile and dial"" was right on in the film and we all made money and spent it like mad. I went through the crash of '87 and many others. We drank a lot, had sex a lot, many used drugs a lot, and went very nuts. The penny stock trash was something that actually did happen and still does. You could know nothing about finances, and investment planning, but if you could sell, that is all that mattered. Another great film that is right on about this is Boiler Room with many stars and shows how nasty brokers can get. Don't bring children or people totally against the reality of drugs, booze, n boobs. It is long and could be shorter but is worth seeing. Just stay through the whole thing.","DEC 28, 2013",5,Drama
The Wolf of Wall Street,"Hey you! Have you been so let down after experiencing something there was a lot of hype for? Lower your expectations and you will find that The Wolf Of Wall street is at least entertaining. DiCaprios performance is as ever, and quite the same. Margot Robbies acting was sub par, I gets thats the price you pay when hiring an adult entertainer. I do say that Jonah Hills character in this was well done in comparison to his other works. The brief narrations in this movie irked me, as they narration wasnt well done and never seemed to capture the emotion of the given scene. What else could I say about this movie that's not necessarily negative? If you want to watch a movie about massive debauchery and not think too much, I say this movie will do the trick.","JUL 6, 2014",5,Drama
The Wolf of Wall Street,"I love the films of Martin Scorsese but I wish Thelma Schoonmaker his editor, would have cut an hour off this run-on spectacle of greed, sex and drugs that is suppose to shock us. Like the Aunt Margret character who states at one point... yeah I lived through the 60's. I was feeling like Scorsese thought his audience wasn't sophisticated enough to understand the excess these guys thrived on. I think we got that in the first half hour. Too bad we don't get to see a little more dimension of this guy, but instead time is wasted on the same old repetitive behavior over and over again sex, drugs, sex, drugs, greed, greed, greed. This movie had so many great things going for it but just goes over the top to try to be funny but instead is just plain obnoxious. Too bad so many talents were wasted because of the lack of tightening up and cutting scenes and developing other characters to counter the balance of the the over-all story.

""Leo"" and ""Marty"" can claim all they like in interviews that their intention was to make a movie about an amoral **** without judgment. However, in so reserving such judgment, they effectively sanction every vile action depicted (on which I think enough has already been written). Storytellers have a responsibility to do more than make something that's technically sound (which this movie assuredly is hence the 2 rating, rather than 0) they have a responsibility to tell a story worth telling. And, unless you're trying to relate to simply the white, rich, racist, misogynistic, megalomaniacs of the US (of which I have no doubt there are many), I just don't think this story's worth telling.

The Wolf of Wall Street,"The worst sin of this movie is that it drags along, self indulging in drugs abuse scenes and unsuccessfully trying to depict sex scenes with some more meaning than soft porn. At some points it just plainly goes overboard to a ""fear and loathing in Las Vegas"" style and zero-meaning scenes. The filler about drugs, sex and testosterone takes the stage away from the real movie, ending up probably pleasing just those who we're looking for it, and not much more. In fact, there's actually something more to the movie, but while it's well depicted by a good director and actors, in the end it results quite thin and uncertain, leaving a sense of emptiness for how the movie evolves.

The Wolf of Wall Street,"I confess I had some curiosity and some expectations when I went to see this movie. Scorcese and Di Caprio are two of the biggest names in the current film scene, and both have provided us with some nice films. So I wasn't surprised with the fuss around the movie but, when I saw it, I was very disappointed. The film is based on an autobiographical book written by Jordan Belfort, a stockbroker who quickly enriched, through financial maneuvers of high risk and zero legality. The book describes not only the business but the life of luxury, drugs and sex that he took, and the way he eventually paid for it. The film, as far as we understand, is quite faithful to the book's account, and the book also makes an apparently true story. The film resembles ""Goodfellas"" in many ways, but with great differences in which the gangster movie gets the better of it. The main problem of this film lies in three essential points: The first point is the apparent glorification of the fraud and Belfort's dissolute lifestyle. The message passed by the film is ""crime pays"". It spends more than an hour telling us, in detail, the outrages of Belfort and his team of **** without any need, shocking some public, who leave the cinema with the feeling that the film passes an ethically wrong message, and society does not need to receive it because it receives enough bad influences. The second essential point is the absence of a counterpoint to the scenes of excesses shown. Okay, Belfort is a swine, drug addict and corrupt who has gotten rich too fast and too easy. So? Where is the counterpoint to that? He committed crimes, but what are the effects of his crimes? Who lost out on Belfort's crimes? How can audiences truly realize the size of his mistakes? The public never gets these answers because the film gets too lost in the details of Belfort's scandals. The movie makes people think that Belfort never harmed anyone, and that he was just crazy, or smart. The third negative point is the construction of the characters. They are black-and-white, without the psychological complexity and refinement that we find in ""Goodfellas"", for example. There's no such thing here. The characters are summed up as junkies, sex offenders, eccentrics, some bored cops and little else. DiCaprio was well enough in his role, but being such an abject role, it's impossible to like and enjoy his performance. I think Scorcese thought this film as a comedy, but the truth is that it is not funny. The film is morally shocking, not funny. So, it was a bad idea. This film would have been excellent if it had been conceived as a drama and had behind it some moral balance. That was not the case. It is a mad journey through senseless immorality, without notion and without any pretext than easy laughter, and this is quite unpleasant.","APR 24, 2018",1,Drama
The Wolf of Wall Street,"Scorsese has never recaptured his great years of Taxi Driver and Raging Bull. Any film that lionises a low life like Jordan Belfort does not deserve a good review.

The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1,"Dear Stephanie Meyer, You Ripped off Buffy the vampire slayer and Southern Vampire Mysteries and have been far too successful with it. This films pacing is off, acting is wooden and there is no humour except for the terribly written dialogue and ugly unconvincing CGI. Bella is barely a character and more of cardboard cut out, who really isn't a very good example to young women. This girl is badly harmed after having sex with her husband, but its ok cause he didn't mean to do it. That's very reminiscent of what a lot of women in physically abusive relationships say. It may be fantasy, but teenagers and younger are heavily influenced by what they read and watch so I'm gonna ask Stephanie Meyer.... Can you either stop writing books OR have Buffy (you already stole the characters romance why not the whole character) and have an empowering woman that teens can look up to and not feel repressed by her male counter parts.","JAN 2, 2012",8,Drama

Maybe because restrictions faced in penning down things are way different from those in bringing them alive on the screen. But yet again, there can be a slight difference and not change things drastically. This movie does follow this rule. Detailing is important in both the modes, books and movie, but the ways are different. The movie lacks this detailing. The director has tried to detail things in his way but they make things boring.

The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1,"This was actually my favorite Twilight movie so far. I didn't see any of them until last fall. Watched them with my sister and we both really liked the first one. I felt like the first half of the second one was good too, but overall not as good as the first. I thought the third one was awful. But this one? I really really enjoyed it. If you aren't into this sort of thing, you're not gonna like it. And if you are new to the series, don't start here. Saw it with someone who hadn't seen much of the other movies, and to them the first half hour was crazy boring, but to people who are into the story, it is great. Obviously, if you already know you don't like the Twilight movies or books, why would you ever go to this movie? You're not gonna like it. But if you are a fan, you will probably love it, and if you are the kind of person who likes movies in general as long as they are good for what they are meant to be, then you might enjoy it too, though you wouldn't want to start here, you'd want to go back and watch the movies from the start.

Yes, there is some seriously suspect special effects and make-up work going on here, but if we can live with Tom Cruise in a blond wig, then I guess we can do the same for Peter Facinelli. Go see this movie if you have already seen the other two, otherwise move on to something that you might enjoy more (after consulting your friends on Metacritic, of course).

The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1,"I must say I appreciate Bill Condon's vision for Breaking Dawn Part 1, but unfortunately his vision wasn't enough to redeem the Twilight saga from past failures. The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Part 1 is by far the most mature and visually fascinating movie of the franchise thus far. It's satisfying to see improvements in many areas including the acting, and dialogue and pleasing to be able to enjoy memorable scenes from the book that work on screen. There wasn't one boring moment which seemed to be one of the many problems in it's predecessors, but it created another problem. Though it was the shortest of all Twilight films, it had much to cover and packing it into not even two hours wasn't the best solution. I found many scenes cut way too short which is very unfortunate because the emotion and tension created in many of the scenes, such as Bella and Edward making love for the first time, were like nothing Twilight fans ever experienced before, while others, such as the werewolves speaking telepathically, created great tension but made me feel like I was watching a melodramatic cartoon. The acting was greatly improved. Kristin Stewart's performance walking down the isle at her wedding ceremony was very relieving and surprising to be honest. It might not be the performance of the year, but she created the emotion in that scene. I never thought Robert Pattinson needed much improvement but you definitely get a greater feel of what he's capable of in terms of his performance, and Taylor Lautner, although it wasn't the best, improved which was all we could ask for. There are plenty of laughs and memorable moments. Maybe too many for one movie. Breaking Dawn Part 1 wasn't the best of the saga, but it wasn't the worst. There was enough to be satisfied but too much in too little time to create the movie we were all hoping for.","FEB 6, 2012",5,Drama

The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1,"It can be considered in two different ways: a movie about a teenage and her undying love for an undead who wants to be changed into a vampire to stop her aging while living amongst a strange fantasy world that not even your concerned parents can know about. Or it can be considered as one of the boldest and daring twilight film to date considering the maturity of the subject about pregnancy and Bella's pro-life choice. Either way, its not a twilight movie without some of its moments. Moments that do shine are more towards the beginning (the wedding scene and her romantic-""painful"" honeymoon) and the 20 mins that happened at the last part (the most disturbing birth scene that I've seen since Rosemary's Baby). The movie is more melodramatic and full of humorous moments (intentional or unintentional) from Jacob's pack to his imprinting which shows that Taylor's best acting was in Eclipse. Kristen Stewart does have the vain she showed in New Moon, in her expressions of a skeleton-like figure she does however show quiet determination which is probably her best acting in this series. During the end, the birth scene is incredibly powerful and disturbing: bones cracking, Bella's agony and scream for the baby to come out, Rosalie's attempt to save her but ultimately cause more stress while the two suitors comfort and take position in helping the dying Bella. Bottomline: Hardcore fans only! It still doesn't improve on the script but you don't consider it due to the fact that its actually mature, darker and deeper in meaning then the three other films. Its a well-made film, has a likeable main character and has a strong message (not to marry young and always wear protection whether it be an 100-something vampire) about pro-life BUT is bogged down by the dialogue and script","NOV 25, 2011",6,Drama

The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1,"It seems like every time I ask someone what they thought of this movie I either get a really positive or really negative review. I am going to be 100% honest when I say I am a die hard twilight fan. I love the characters and the story. I must say that I was expecting something a lot different from what I saw at the midnight release. The main parts I remember in the movie are wedding, honey moon, and birth. I will tell you one thing, they certainly did push an R rating for this movie. It some parts towards the end it is simply disturbing and I was left with disgusting images of a very sick Bella. I felt a lot of emotions during this movie. I liked the intense scenes and I like how Bella had seemed to found her voice. This is by no means my favorite movie though. I think the previous movie, Eclipse, was a lot better written and produced. This movie is better then the first installment, Twilight, but not by much. I am very disappointed with that I saw. I hope that the next movie is more light hearted and uplifting then this one because I would had for the series to end like this one did. The ending was drawn out and obviously easy to guess.

I had a smile on my face from start to finish and there were quite a few times I actually laughed because the movie was played off as being serious but was epicly failing to do so.

The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1,"I have a question. What made you get into the line to see thiz movie in the first place? Just to see good looking faces or you want to see Edward and Bella hot honeymoon. If that is the case then you have got it all. Finally, the end of thiz saga will be completed in thiz last chapter where the chain of major events occurs such as the wedding, Bella pregnancy and the last battle. Robert Pattinson and Kristen Stewart are still in the spotlight, carrying their iconic figures. They both seem to have fun with their roles, however, their acting skills have shown either no decline or an improvement. Get ready for some mellow madness, because the story will grow more intimate. If you are a true fan of thiz franchise, you will be one of them who cheers and screams throughout the movie. You will see the marriage, the honeymoon night and yeah, a lot of kissing coming! What if you are not one of them? O ow! We have got a little problem here. You have definitely got into the wrong theater. Your nightmare is about to begin. It is pretty awkward and monotone to see the couple always flirt and pamper each other. I appreciate the first TWILIGHT (2008), there were some real romantic atmospheres there. But further and further away, the chemistry between Edward and Bella looks even more like badly overacting. It has already happened since NEW MOON (2009) and ECLIPSE (2010). It is Taylor Lautner as Jacob Black who gives a better performance. The other regular Cast members like Billy Burke, Ashley Greene, Jackson Rathbone, Kellan Lutz, Nikki Reed and Peter Facinelli made an exact impression of the previous movies. Three previous movies are directed by three different Directors and it happens in thiz sequel as well. Thiz time, the movie is directed by Bill Condon who is the man behind smash musical hit DREAMGIRLS in 2006. Cutting the last part into two movies was a terrible idea in the first place. Recently, HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS (2010-2011) had done the same, dividing their final installment into two movies but in that case it looked like a reasonable idea, considering the basic materials are too thick and so much to tell.

The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1,"I have to chuckle at one review I'm reading right now, who says this movie should be viewed as ""light hearted entertainment. Breaking Dawn - Part 1 has nothing light about it, except for the few scenes in which the director tries to make you laugh. With an overall grim tone, and plenty of soap operatic drama for all, the latest Twilight movie does manage to keep you watching the whole thing, if you didn't already want to run before it started. The major issue I had with the movie is that the plot is very light. In terms of events, we had a wedding, a single night of sex, and a birth. Oh, and throw in some twisted dreams that I'm sure had Kristen Stewart shuddering herself. While the movie attempts to stretch this out, coming in at just under two hours, much of it seems needless, as though they are trying to convince you that it's really not just a money grab by splitting it into two movies. There are moments that I enjoyed. Robert Pattinson manages to create a good role out of not such great opportunities, as his brooding character portrayals are getting better. The emotions evoked by much of the main cast are spot on. Billy Burke claims most of the movie's humour, with his quips to Edward, and they are quite enjoyable. Not being a huge fan of the series, these moments kept me entertained for the most part. Special effects are dreary, to say the least, but those expecting great special effects for a movie that is more about the inability of many characters to emote, are in the wrong theatre. This inability is dealt with in this movie, which is what helps its view-ability. I did not watch New Moon, or Eclipse, having sworn off the series after seeing Twilight. However, with Breaking Dawn - Part 1, I feel as though I can now go to Part 2 next year, give them more of my money, and enjoy myself. That is the point of the movie, so despite its problems, it succeeds. Oh, and P.S. If you don't normally stay for credits, please do this time.","NOV 21, 2011",5,Drama

Breaking Dawn is my favorite book in the Whole series and frankly I thought it could be so much better. I absolutely love the cast but some scenes were so bad in terms of acting like the first scene between Edward and Bella. Bill Condon left so many important details out. Some scenes that were so emotionally strong for me in the book were a joke in the movie like the wolves gathering which was suppose to be a big turn in jacobs' life and perspective. That scene in the book was sad and uneasy: Jacob had to make a huge choice that I think starts his maturity through the book. The honeymoon could be a lot better and the chess scenes were unnecessasry. The wedding scene were amazing. The dress was fabulous. The birth scene could be so much better if the director was more daring. This movie could be raised to a whole new level but the director didn't use the potential of the book in the movie. There were some great scenes but overall after watching this movie again I can say that I was disappointed.

They're cheaper to produce than your standard blockbuster, but raking in enormous amount of dough worldwide, averaging around $700 mill per movie! No wonder its producer decided to 'break' (no pun intended) its last book into two 'parts'. As with any such 'money grabbing' exercise, it ruins pacing completely. The first 45 min involves almost lingering shots of Bella having 'marriage' jitters. By around mid film, the actual plot started to move and BAM!! To be continued!

The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1,"As far as the series goes, this movie was by far the worst. The first movie was nice because it was a refreshing fantasy romance novelty. Boy meets girl. Girl discovers that boy is a vampire. Evil vampire chases girl for blood. Boy and family kill evil vampire. After that movie, the rest of the films just took a jump off a clip. The rest of the movies just use the same recycled plot. We spend 3/4 of the movie listening to dialog. Finally at the end, there's a big vampire fight and the good guys win. I can live with that, but do they really have to give us the same old bland story for every movie? In this story, we spend roughly half of the movie watching a newlywed couple make love in the bed, the livingroom, the beach, and everywhere else they can think of. C'mmon...I'm eating nachos and I don't want to puke before the end of the movie. After THAT was finally over, we spend the next 35% of the movie talking about how Bella might DIE! At the end...WHEW! She's not dead! Of course no Twilight movie would be complete without a big battle with werewolves and vampires. The dogs look as artificial as ever. The vampires fight like they all have chronic constipation. Oh yeah, the good guys **** there really aren't any real bad guys and there really isn't much at stake.

The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1,"As an ex-Twilight fan, I woke up to the fact that the Twilight saga has an awful plot and character development. I used to crazily love the saga until i sadly realized the huge defects Meyer made in the series. Now, I am sad to say that this film and the Twilight saga in general is the most disappointing thing I have ever seen in my whole life. The reasons to prove this are: (1) It promotes a bad influence towards teenagers, (2) It does NOT portray real romance, and it instead portrays inappropriate methods to maintain a couple despite claims that it promotes abstinence, (3) The series itself is inundated with an awful, poorly-written plot and wooden, Mary-Sueish characters, (4) Cliches appear ubiquitous in the four books, (5) It has an awful fanbase, which gave the books a label of being overrated, (6) The most important reason is the portrayal of Bella Swan herself. She is the main reason why I hate this damn series. Bella is a bad role model, which is proven by her inability to go without her vampire boyfriend. Overall, I give the Twilight series in general a mediocre rating due to its profoundly bad impact to my life and its cardboard characters together with a plot and writing style that is supposed to be designed for younger immature children. SMeyer needs to upgrade her writing style.:|","DEC 2, 2011",3,Drama
The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1,"I'm giving this movie a 2, not because I'm a hater, but because that it what it deserved. Yes, I am a male and no, I do not hate the Twilight Saga. Up until this movie, I was actually starting to kinda like it. I always enjoyed watching it with my girlfriend and it had just the right mixture of romance, action, suspense and CGI. However, a lot of that universally appealing stuff was thrown out here. The majority of the movie was spent watching the couple trying to have sex. Usually in PG-13 movies, you get a sexual innuendo or implied sex scene but here, they focused entirely too much on it. The only action that happened, happened toward the end and that was promptly ruined by the absolutely grotesque imagery of a dying Bella giving birth to a vampireous creature. She dies while giving birth and is bitten repeatedly by Edward in an attempt to revive her. It was a mixture of a slasher film with pregnancy... not good. Also the whole idea of Jacob loving a baby in a romantic way, is borderline wrong. I don't really know what else to say about it other than, I wouldn't see it again. I gave it a 2 because I thought the series did a good job up until now and the 1 or 0 that it deserved would be harsh. Hopefully they used this is a semi-plot building movie and the next installment will do better.","JUN 26, 2013",2,Drama

This year the game has chosen 16 years old Ketniss and her friend Peeta, who loves her, but it is a big secret. They have to become enemies and friendship since childhood has no matter. Only one of 24 players can win. For characters this is an effort to survive, for the audience this is a show. The best thing about the film is the plot (written by Suzanne Collins), which is extremely exciting. The sounds and decorations create a complete picture. The performances are great too!

The Hunger Games,"This film is the adaptation of a literary trilogy by Suzanne Collins. I didn't read them, I have no particular intention of doing that, so I will ignore the books and focus on the film. And what I have to say is very positive. The film brings a dystopian view of humanity: Panem is a nation divided into 12 districts, where people live and work to sustain the luxury and power of the ruling and social elite, who lives in the Capital. After a brutal civil war, the elite set up the Hunger Games in memory of that carnage, and to remember the loyalty that each district owes to the Capital. In the games, which are a mix of Big Brother, FIFA World Cup and ""Apocalypse Now"", two teenagers (male and female) from each district fight to the death, or better say, try to keep on living until everyone has died. This film tells us the gaming experience of Katniss Everdeen, a young woman from District 12 who offers herself in the place of her younger sister. There is some details in this film that I think are not well explained. One of them is the title: was there hunger? The whole environment around who is Katniss and what her life was like in District 12 before the reaping seems too chalky to be clear. That's a big problem but if we chose to ignore it the film flows, and it does it wonderfully after the reaping scene. One of the things that most caught my attention is the similarity between Panem and the ancient Rome, either by the character's names, the environment of the Capital, or by the idea of having deadly games as entertainment (kind of modern gladiators, you see?), whether by using the eagle as a symbol of power. The similarity is evident... and purposeful. Jennifer Lawrence proved to be perfectly up to the challenge and maintains a good cooperation with Josh Hutcherson, who is never quite as interesting as she is. Lawrence also makes a very good work when she shares the screen with Willow Shields, who gave life to Primrose. The romantic interest in Liam Hemsworth's character, however, is as cold as winter. In the supporting cast, we can highlight the good performances of Wes Bentley, Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson, Toby Jones, Lenny Kravitz, Amandla Stenberg and, most especially, a huge Donald Sutherland, cold and majestic in the shoes of the dictator Snow. At first glance, Stanley Tucci seems histrionic and annoying, but if we look at his character as a satire of a thousand and one talk and reality show hosts around the world, his work acquires another consistency and relevance. In addition to a great cast and a good story, the film has excellent production values: careful cinematography with good contrast, but which fails to abuse the unstable camera movement; excellent sets and costumes, good CGI and sound effects. The soundtrack deserves a special mention for its effectiveness and beauty. Composed by James Newton Howard, it is one of those that remains in the ear long after we have seen the film. Full of action and with an excellent story, this film may not be perfect but it left good premises for the sequel that inevitably happened. It is worth seeing, but I don't know how much younger children are prepared to see and, above all, to understand the story told.","MAY 1, 2020",9,Thriller

The Hunger Games,"Starting the 2012 reviews a little far in, are we? Unfortunately, starting with 2012 and moving forward, I haven't seen as many movies as I would like to. I'm hoping to change that, but let's review what I have seen, shall we? I'll be the first to point out that I didn't read ""The Hunger Games."" I had no idea what the book was about when I went to see the film (I only saw it because my mom loved the books and the trailers looked good). I can safely say that the film delivered. Wonderfully acted (especially by Jennifer Lawrence) and action-packed while still featuring an interesting story and great characters, ""The Hunger Games"" manages to avoid falling into ""YA no man's land"" like many of the films ""inspired"" by ""Harry Potter"" and ""Twilight"" that we've seen throughout the 2010s. Some may disagree with me giving it a score this high, but I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Hunger Games"" from start to finish and I think it's definitely worth a look.","DEC 19, 2016",10,Thriller
The Hunger Games,"Actually good! Jannifer Lawrence gives a good performance in the film. It's not one of his best, but it's still satisfactory. Woody Harrelson and Alexander Ludwig also do a good job. The film's dystopian atmosphere is sustainable, given the greater depth covered in later films. The characters are mostly uninteresting. They are not worked on correctly, resulting in a very pseudo-psychopathic artificiality, appealing to dehumanization. The soundtrack is absent and the special effects, for the time, are not bad. And the theme reminds me a lot of ""Battle Royale"", which at the time of the book's release, didn't even dream of being a rage.","SEP 6, 2019",7,Thriller
The Hunger Games,"The Hunger Games is a good and action-packed movie with a little love story at its core. I've never read the books of ""The Hunger Games"", but I thought it was a great movie! The only bad thing about the movie, in my opinion, is that there was hardly any character development. But this could be because I didn't read the books. A pity anyway! There are no other complaints on my part. The story is well staged and very understandable. The acting performance is wonderful. Especially by Jennifer Lawrence. At the beginning one is slowly introduced into the movie, but this is no problem. This makes the story easy to understand. Then the movie becomes more and more thrilling during the course of the story. The ""Hunger Games"" are also very well done. In the games you also see a little violence, but not too much. At least the violence shouldn't be the focus, but the ""Hunger Games"" themselves. The movie also has a little love story at its core (of which I don't want to anticipate too much), which is also sweetly brought to a close. Conclusion: The Hunger Games is not a movie you MUST have seen. But it's a good movie! From my side I can recommend the film with a clear conscience!","MAY 6, 2019",8,Thriller

The Hunger Games,"Why The Hunger Games? The Hunger Games is based on the books that Suzanne Collins wrote. The world of Panem is where this movie takes place. Panem has 12 Districts, all who have to provide the Capital with a resource. Such as District 12 supplies the Capital with coal, District 5 with power to all the districts and the Capital, and District 7 with lumber. Every year all the districts have to send one boy and one girl, from the ages 12 to 18, to the Capital to fight to the death till only one remains. This act of cruelty is to keep all the districts from fighting one another, or worse, fighting the capital. After this one victor remains he/she goes back to their district to live the rest of their life in peace and riches. This is called The Hunger Games. Entertaining 1 2 3 4 Kept dozing off in the middle of the movie and couldn’t stay focused. Most parts of the movie were really good but had more down parts to it. Some parts of the movie could have been better but it was still really good. Kept me fully entertained and I didn’t want the movie to end. Evidence: I give this movie a 4/4 for entertainment. This movie keeps you on your toes through the whole movie and I never got bored with it. When you think things are going to slow down they don’t. This movie is a very exciting movie. It’s exciting because you never know what’s around the corner. Some of the things that happen, you don’t realize it’s going to happen. Did the actors work good together 1 2 3 4 The actors didn’t work well together and could have done a lot better. Some actors worked well together and all the others didn’t. Only a few of the actors didn’t work well together. All the actors made the movie come together and worked excellent together. Evidence: I gave the actors a 4/4. I believe that the actors worked well together. When you think about who should act in this movie, you don’t think of any other actors that could have filled that roll. All the actors worked very well together and I liked the chemistry that all the actors had together. It also helps that the actors have had other jobs before this one so they are experienced. The best actor from this movie, in my opinion, is Katniss ( Jennifer Lawrence ). She follows her role very well compared to the book. Length of the movie 1 2 3 4 It was to short or long. It was to short or long but the movie was okay. It could have been longer or shorter but was a good length. It was just the right length. Evidence: I give the length of the movie a 3/4. The length of the movie was okay. I think they could have made it longer if they wanted too but it was a good length. If it would have been longer it could have made it boring. Movies are usually 2 hours long so the movie fits into that range, but with everything going on in this movie I feel like it could have been longer. If they would have made it a shorter movie I feel like they would have left things out and it would have ended up being a bad movie. Was the movie related to the book 1 2 3 4 The movie was nothing like the book. Left out or added a lot of things that weren’t in the book. Only left out or added a few things to the movie. The movie followed the book exactly. Evidence: I gave this movie a 3/4 for following the book. This movie did really well with sticking to the movie. There was some little thing left out of the movie that were in the book, like the cat in the movie was a different color than the cat in the book. They also left out a part that was in the book but wasn’t in the movie, it was when Katniss went into the woods to her father’s cabin. Some of these things are little things but you can tell if you pay attention. How well did you like the movie 1 2 3 4 I didn’t like this movie at all. It was an okay movie. It was a good movie but not my favorite. It is my favorite movie. Evidence: I gave this movie a 4/4 for how well I liked the movie. This movie is one of my favorite movies. It has a lot of action in it which makes it fun. It has a little love story which makes it a nice couples movie. It is overall a great movie to watch with friends and family. Overall I give this movie a 3/4 . This movie is one of my favorite movies and I really feel like it should get this rating.

The Hunger Games,"I loved all of Suzanne Collins' novels in this series, The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and Mockingjay. The films are also very well produced. For fans that gravitate toward film franchises that are precisely complimentary to their source material (e.g. the Harry Potter and Millenium [Stieg Larsson] book and film series', amongst others), you may enjoy The Hunger Games film franchise. Indeed, most aspects of these four films faithfully follow the details of Collins' novels, except (primarily) for the portrayal of Katniss Everdeen. According to Collins, Katniss is small is stature (smaller than Clove, much smaller than Cato), thin but strong for her age, with an olive complexion, long black straight hair, and grey eyes. Whilst Jennifer Lawrence is an excellent performer, she was just so ill-suited to the role of Katniss, if indeed narrative accuracy was of any concern to Lionsgate. If Katniss/Jennifer were not the protagonist, instrumental to virtually every scene of the four films, such character inconsistency would not be so significant. Yet, she is and it is, which - for myself - ultimately detracted from the ability to be absorbed by the story. In conclusion, the films are very good, provided one has not read the books previously.","JUN 14, 2019",4,Thriller

I kept facepalming because of all the errors that were made. Important characters and events are kept out of the movie. There is no character development at all. It's like the writer expect everyone to have read the books before seeing this, and I bet over half of the people who saw this, didn't. So disappointed.","AUG 15, 2013",5,Thriller

The Hunger Games,"The Hunger Games is an overall disappointment. The book tells you that this ""game"" comes with brutality, and the movie tells you brutality can't be found only glimpses of disturbing imagery can. For the technical categories The Hunger Games is an achievement. The pace destroys the movie though. Movies are kind of like music. They have timing. The Hunger Games threw events at you bam bam bam bam! It tried to fit everything in so well that the movies pace was to uneasy and fast leaving it with boringness and unpleasantsy.","APR 21, 2013",5,Thriller
The Hunger Games,"Why did I watch it? I had never heard of the Hunger Games series prior to the film coming out, proof if needed that I'm obviously not a 'young adult anymore! the other half came in with this the other day so I gave into the hype and gave it a go. What's it all about? Set in a fictional American dystopian future, a new nation called Panem is divided into 12 distinct districts and controlled by the powerful and rich Capitol. As punishment for an uprising some years before, The Capitol organise a yearly competition known as the Hunger Games where each district must send 2 competitors, one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18, known as tributes. The children are left to fight until the death until only one survives and is declared the champion. Should you watch it? I was largely non-fussed by The Hunger Games. Having not read the books I've no idea how the adaptation compares but as a standalone film it wasn't bad but it wasn't too great either. The story borrows elements from The Truman Show, Running Man and Blade Runner among others. I should plead ignorance in having not yet seen Battle Royale, but I'm aware that the plot is remarkably similar. The point being that the plot is not awfully original. The directing and editing in the districts did not work for me. The shaky camera work and chop editing might have been selected to create a sense of disorganisation and panic in the districts during tribute selection but I found it too much. Another gripe I had was the use of flashbacks by Gary Ross. Flashbacks of unseen footage provide the viewer with an opportunity to see what has previously occured and can be plot aids but why did Ross choose to show flashbacks of scenes we had already seen, one in particular several times over. I clearly missed the importance of the scene. I felt the film was dumbed down in places, definitely in terms of violence, which I can understand with this being a Hollywood production with children involved but also with some of the script. A prime example being at the end when the game organiser announces that the rules are being changed spontaneously again, It is so obvious what the rule change is going to be but yet the characters are made to listen to the full announcement with a few more seconds afterwards to digest the ramifications. There are decent performances from Jennifer Lawrence and Woody Allen so its far from all bad.","NOV 10, 2012",6,Thriller
The Hunger Games,"How summit keep insisting on teenage dumb movies? People said that this movie is great, but not even jennifer lawrence save this crap,i hope the sequels gets better.","DEC 9, 2014",4,Thriller
The Hunger Games,"Whilst this is far from the best film and I fully accept that I am not the target audience, I did manage to have a good time watching it. The world and the story completely lacks subtlety. The subtext is as obvious as it could possibly be. The production design also totally lacks subtlety, the depiction of future higher class society is obnoxious. The portrayal of the working class is equally stereotypical. The concept that the upper class are evil and the lower class are heroes lacks the intricacies of real life and the moral decisions are less believable because of this. Some of the visual effects are not the best. The night scenes are a bit too dark. The shaky camera is too intense and generally the cinematography is disappointing. I really didn’t like the costume and makeup design of the aristocrats. But through these faults there is an engaging and shining beacon in this film. The character writing. The characters are so well drawn and their motivations so believable that you can’t help but get drawn into the story. The lead character is especially believable, she is vulnerable, strong and a hero. The sound design is good and I especially liked the composed music. It’s not the most original, Battle Royale (2000) is one example of a similar story but the characters and how they are acted make this worthwhile.","OCT 18, 2023",6,Thriller
The Hunger Games,I give this rating 4/10 because i watched it to many times they make dumb choices in the movie . Grade for hunger games B Grade for catching fire D.,"APR 11, 2014",4,Thriller
The Hunger Games,"Extremely overrated! There was a lot of hype for this film and I can't believe that so many people were drawn in by this movie. Now we have another mediocre film series based on a novel for teenagers. The best thing about this film is that it spawned the career of Jennifer Lawrence, who has shown off her chops in a lot of better films. I won't be watching another one of these films.","FEB 6, 2015",5,Thriller
The Hunger Games,"The first hour of the film is preamble to the actual ""games"" and the costumes we're treated to at ""The Capital"" seem straight out of Terry Gilliam's comic dystopian film Brazil. There's nothing in the movie to indicate that anyone involved in the production knows the first thing about bushcraft. Heck, it isn't even clear if the action in the woods is real or the creation of some ""Matrix""-like computer system which permits the show-runners of the Games to call up beasts and fireworks at the touch of a console key. Then there's the matter of the justification for holding the games. Is it a punishment for a rebellion or a patriotic exercise? What exactly is the motivation for the participants? Maybe you have to read the books to get it. All in all, the film struck me as a young adult production and in contrast to many reviews I thought it slow, superficial, and short on story. The acting was fine but the cast had so little to work with I wouldn't recommend the film to any except diehard fans of the novels and to them I would say don't expect much.","DEC 29, 2017",6,Thriller
The Hunger Games,"Look, in my head, this film was much better, I saw it recently and noticed that most things in the film don't have much weight, either because it was too fast or because the film took away its own credibility. There are several moments in the film where you're like why didn't they kill him or why are you talking to her instead of just killing her. Except for the scene with the guy hitting the girl's head until she died, that one right there, someone could have killed him, was cool so fuck you. Overall, it's an ok film to watch.","APR 10, 2022",6,Thriller
The Hunger Games,"Ok; honestly, I didn't see this originally because it didn't look interesting to me. But everyone hyped it up, and now with all the ""catching fire"" buzz I decided to check out the first one to see if I was wrong. The 6 rating is to be fair to the actors, who did a great job with a ridiculous script. The premise of the movie is unbelievable, while the parallels with reality are too subtle and underdeveloped. It is like half action movie, half Alice in Wonderland (the strange Tim Burton one), and it doesn't work-- at least, not for me. I have heard the books are better; well that is usually true, but if the book is based on the same premise-- a futuristic society hosting gladiator events between children --I would probably find it equally ridiculous.","NOV 27, 2013",6,Thriller
The Hunger Games,"The movie Gladiator felt real. You got the feeling that the gladiators were going to fight to their death: they were peeing before the gates opened up, they were silent, etc... The people in The Hunger Games might as well have been at a party. They showed no sense of worry or that they were about to fight each other for their lives. Maybe the younger ones might have wondered what was going on even! This killing each other for the entertainment of others, has happened in human history: Ancient Rome, maybe even else where! Could it happen again?!?! I wanted some connection or reference made and the sense that this might happen again in humanity. We are already at UFC. I wanted to see the audience (in the film) cheering on the kills, like in Gladiator. I wanted to be shocked and scared at the end. Having two main characters survive at the end (and both return home) gave me the sense that the movie was about youth surviving, not youth being killed.","MAR 9, 2013",6,Thriller
The Hunger Games,"I'll start off by making the point that I'm acutely aware that I'm not the target audience of this picture, but would also add that this shouldn't prevent any appreciation I might have when it's done right. Sadly, The Hunger Games struggles on too many occasions for this to be a consideration. I will say that my own biases may also play a part, as general irritation with certain aspects of the movie may relate to me specifically. Disclaimers aside, the early stages of the film were reasonable. It was much grittier than I was expecting in introducing the hardships of life in the district. However, it didn't take long for the first source of annoyance to rear its teen heartthrob of a head... I'm far more familiar with Liam Hemsworth's brother Chris than I am with him, and on this evidence, Liam should be taking more than a few pointers from his older brother. Why he chose to earnestly squint his way through the mercifully brief screen time he is afforded is beyond me, and quite honestly, it drove me nuts. It smacks of pandering to the tweenie audience (as do the ridiculously transparent character names) and it really aggravated me. Saving grace then that he was not, as I was expecting, the male counterpart to Lawrence's Katniss. I found Josh Hutcherson infinitely less infuriating and was able to move on with my life without putting a hole in my TV. On a mildly positive note, the scenes of children being herded to the 'reaping', the name given to the event at which the contestants are chosen, was suitably dark in tone. There is a decent sense of foreboding about the whole thing and I was fairly engaged for a few minutes, the tearful goodbyes and desperation adding to the spectre of things to come. It was reminiscent of a few wartime movies, but the fact that it was even in there was pleasing. Unfortunately, this is not where the beg, borrow and steal mentality ended. I'm not so sure that there is anything completely original left in the popular view of a science fiction future, but when it becomes so distracting that you can't stop pointing out aspects derived from other films, there's a problem. I won't bore anyone with a complete list here, suffice it to say that I noticed everything from Gattaca to Demolition Man and many others in between being misappropriated in the set design and it really got to me. On top of this, The Fifth Element provides more or less the entirety of the cues for the costumes of the population of the city. I was relieved once the action moved to the event itself and this is where the film was at its strongest. A good proportion of the action sequences are executed quite well and undeniably raise the film as a whole. The soundtrack is all a bit 'by the numbers', but bearable and apt at the very least. There's a lot of contrived plot silliness that takes place during the games sequences, but at least this section didn't exhaust me like much of the rest of the film did. Ultimately, it's not much worse than average, but there was far too much about this that had me gritting my teeth in despair to get anything out of the experience.","JUL 4, 2013",4,Thriller
The Hunger Games,"The Hunger Games, based on a novel of the same title by Suzanne Collins, fails to deliver as much suspense as the novel does and even though it tries to deliver some action it delivers no action. The Hunger Games is also extremely complicated for those who have not read the book. There are countless things that the viewer won't know if they haven't read the book. The scenes also went by way to fast in my opinion. For a movie that is two hours and twenty-two minutes (about two hours and ten minutes with out the ending credits), this movie should have been made way better. The special effects, though, were extraordinary.","MAY 20, 2013",5,Thriller

The Hunger Games,"The Hunger Games is a decent movie taken from a book... A book which in turn takes it's elements from films like Battle Royale and The Running Man. Talk about cyclical! The Hunger Games shines when viewed as a character piece (Jennifer Lawrence's performance is excellent) or as a slight meditation on social greed and the notion of celebrity. That said, the movie has it's faults. The primary one being the lack of stirring action sequences. The editing and pacing of these scenes when they do arrive are simply unexciting. One thing I will say though is that the violence is tastefully neutered. I have no desire to see young children graphically killed and was mercifully spared from doing so. Ultimately, The Hunger Games was an entertaining movie that I enjoyed. Not nearly as much as Battle Royale, however.","JAN 29, 2013",6,Thriller
The Hunger Games,"Based on the bestselling books for young adults the Hunger Games is a set in a world where, in order to keep the population under control, two children from each of the twelve districts are chosen to compete a two week trial in which only one can survive. I haven't read the books but throughout the movie I got the sense that certain elements have been left underdeveloped and toned down in order to maintain a reasonable running time and ensure a rating that would allow fans of the books to see it. In large part thanks to the central performance by, the always excellent, Jennifer Lawrence however The Hunger Games still makes for a relatively entertaining watch. It is well shot and moves along at a good pace with just enough tension to keep things from become too predictable. Not a classic but certainly worth a watch.","JUL 30, 2014",6,Thriller

I mean, why do they have to do this? I felt like they didn't really answer that, or maybe I just wasn't paying attention enough to find the answers I was looking for. With that confusing plot aside, this is an ""okay"" movie. I like the visuals, the main character is pretty well done and acted out pretty well.

I don't know if the film wants to give me the action of survival in a forest, or the imperialist/colonialist discussion, or the “love” of the protagonists, or the idea of ​​regulation regulating rebellion, or simply a battle royale in which there are rules that are actually rules. I don't know. Jennifer Lawrence doesn't seem like a bad actress to me, but I didn't think she was good in this film, the point is that she only exposed her beauty on the screen all the time, so what the hell would I say about her expressions, anyway?

The Hunger Games,"Saw this movie when it first came out. I was around 11-12 at the time. After having read the books I expected the movies to be great. However, they were never really fantastic. The visuals look so ugly. It seems like someone out a dark orange filter on the whole movie and kind of just forgot about it. When it come to a performance that I think should have gotten high praise, it should have been that woman in the pink dress that says ""May the odds be ever in your favor"" as she seems to really be the inky character next to that long black hair done guy that basically is what I call the owner of Katniss and Peta. It's funny that all the good characters are evil or they're the one black girl that Katniss befriends. Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutchinson both kind of **** in this movie, but because they are the ones that share the screen time the most I guess it makes sense. They're both equally mediocre in this movie that it kind of works. It's not necessarily bad acting, so much as it seems they're taking themselves too seriously at times. Elizabeth Banks seems to kind of take it a lot less seriously than everyone else, and it makes her preformance so much more enjoyable to me. Amandla Stenberg also does a good job for her scenes and I remember really enjoying her screen time. I understand that you can't read a book and then go to the movies expecting it to be exactly how it played out and looked in your head, but there were some things I would have changed if I were working on it. Can we please get end of this dark filter that in the woods makes it look like you covered the camera lens with a bunch of skin from green peas? The also very gritty look is laughably bad and distracted me the whole movie. Another thing I wished the movie had built on was Katniss and her sister's relationship which I felt could have been more wholesome than it really was. They had like 2 scenes together where they seemed lukewarm on each other and then bam Katniss is going into a death trap for her. Again it's little things that distracted me that could have used a little more work. Not a bad movie, but I wouldn't call it great, and I wouldn't say it lived up to the hype. I would say this movie did its job and brought a book to a different audience. To an audience that doesn't read books. That's what it was meant to do. And in terms of story, from what I remember they missed two or three plotlines that really upset me, but other than that it was okay. I'm giving this movie a 5/10 because it's not great, but it isn't bad either.","MAR 8, 2018",5,Thriller

The film left a lot of the politics and violence out to make it watchable for the younger ages, which subsequently created a cheesy, not brilliantly written film.

However this was based on the idea that this was a genuine story, which it is not. This book and film are both completely based on Battle Royal and this film brings absolutely nothing new to this type of storyline. Also, Battle Royal actually had gore while simultaneously making a good film in every way this movie failed it succeeded.

There are several ways that the character of Katniss is just a bland, sociopathic male-stand-in who does everything wrong and seems to get out alive. Peeta is creepy. No question. How he tries to make Katniss act like she's in love with him for the better of the viewers and how he admitted to nearly stalking her in both the film and book. Gale and Prim are useless characters who, if they were removed, the story would still be the same. Haymich isn't alcoholic at all, he's an occasional drunk, and I'm ready to stand up to that point with anyone who wants to protest. I don't want this review to run long with everything that's wrong with this, because there aren't enough characters here to rightly explain.

To it's credit, it is spending time on character development, which can sometimes be rare in movies today. But, there's so many un-necessarry shots and long cuts that one can easily see how the films 2 and a half hour length could be shortened. All this build up finally leads to the actual ""games"" and then the film starts to pick up a bit. The main problem I had with the film though, is that it seems to always be hinting at a deeper, more devious plot-line, that simply never manifests. For example, there are 3 or 4 bizarrely out of place ""flashbacks"" to previous scenes. This devices suggests that ""hey, that scene was important, remember it, because you will need to when we tie in the sub-plot."" But, finally, in the end, you come to discover that there is no sub plot. It's all just meat and potatoes action move schlock, dumbed down and amped up for the American movie viewing masses. Those flashbacks? It's like the director is saying ""Hey, stay with us, Stay awake! I know this film is long and boring, but try to remember what's happening!"" It's a slap in the face and an insult to intelligence. Finally, in the end, you succumb to the fact that the film is mostly a love story, but, you may be holding out hope for a big ""stick it to the man"" moment where the tyrants of the film get their come-uppance, (And also delivering a sub-text on the American government and politics), but nope, we are robbed of that as well.

The Hunger Games,"It's hard for me to understand why so many people thought this movie was well done. I read the first book (mainly because my girlfriend really wanted me to, especially before the movie) and I have to say I'm really glad I did. Although, even if I didn't read the book, the movie is horrible regardless. My favorite character Haymitch never did any of the things that I liked him for in the book. I never cared for Rue as I did in the book, quite frankly I did not care when she died in the movie. When the familiars (the name escapes me) came on screen of the dead tributes, they were awkward dog creatures that did not resemble their former selves. Thresh never did anything. The casting was off as certain characters did not look like how they were portrayed in the book (I know it cannot be perfect but you can make it close). The chariot scene with the fire dress was uninspired. Cinna had no emotion and seemed to really not care for Katniss. The shotty camera work that just shook every time an action scene happened. The fact that Pita didn't lose a leg. This movie is just wrong. It's just bad. Aside from completely ruining the book, the movie alone just is not good. Nothing about it was entertaining especially since I've read the book and know that everything was done so horribly wrong. My girlfriend who is a huge fan of the series (collects everything she can) also hated the movie. We were both sitting in the theater, dumbstruck as people clapped and cheered for a movie that destroyed what the books created. In retrospect I'm sure more than half the people in the movie hadn't read the books but the fact that the author stood behind this, I'll be sure to skip out on anything she does again. Not to mention the fact that I saw Battle Royale which came out before the Hunger Games books and movie and watching that you realize how much is ripped off. Right down to where they have two winners. I'm rambling now but geez, looking up at 831 positive reviews, really? Gah!","APR 13, 2013",0,Thriller
The Hunger Games,"As a hardcore hunger games fan this movie was very disappointing at the least. The movie felt as if everything was going too quickly which I know it might be difficult to put hours of the book into a 2 hour movie but I hated the pace of it. Next I felt that the movie seemed low budget, The flames from the dress on fire was underwhelming, Katniss crying from Rues death even though they hardly knew each other just seemed gag worthy. Next is the poor film writing, There are important parts in the book that get skipped such as; Peetha’s goofiness. In the book he is a goofy kind person but that is not at all what the movie makes him. Keep in mind that I am trying to come from an opinion which is in this case not a big hunger games fan. I noticed that while shooting the apples Katniss takes good time to shoot where as when when she kills the boy that killed Rue it takes less than a second. I think that the actors chosen are good picks but Peeta and Haymitch are not exactly playing their role the best. Now from my view I noticed small things that annoyed me, when Katniss shoots the boy it hits his chest not his neck. This underestimates Katniss’s strength as it’s harder to shoot the neck then the chest. When it is the bread scene Peeta and Katniss are supposed to be 11 but they instead are the same age as they are(probably to keep it low budget) This just makes me laugh how they couldn’t get a dark haired white girl and a blonde boy they have to use the same actors. There are many more I would like to say but I’ve already written 1549 letters. Overall I’d say please Please read the book first before you watch the movie! You would get a good impression from the book that would make you like the hunger games maybe as much as me. I had to read the book again to cleanse myself from watching the movie I hope that explains why I gave it a 3 star. Thanks for reading","MAY 30, 2021",3,Thriller
The Hunger Games,"Lets mix ""the running man"" with the tv show ""Survivor"" target the audience for ""teenagers"" but lets make it as violent as possible. Thats the end result for this movie.

The Hunger Games,"I hated this movie. I had no expectations when going to see it having not read the book or barley having seen the trailer. This film was just far too long and It is rare that I get so bored in the cinema that I either want to sleep or leave.. I did not care for the characters at all as they were unbelievable and annoying. The acting was mediocre to bad and again gave an emphasis to this fake vibe I was getting. The film was just one big lame cliche for me. Time and time again out of the all the odds things would work out for the main character. I know this is typical for movies, but I was actually thinking 'are they serious?'. Without going into any more detail or spoilers I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone over 18, or anyone who likes music because background music in this movie was almost nonexistent.","JUL 14, 2012",3,Thriller
The Hunger Games,"Shameful ripoff of ""Battle Royale,"" and much lower in quality. It's Battle Royale for ""the Twilight crowd.""

The Hunger Games,"Oh yay a terrible summer blockbuster. Stupid, insipid, generic, and an all-around disaster, it perplexes me how The Hunger Games was well received. Classic young adult nonsense featuring every action movie cliche in the history of humanity, the film occasionally pretends to show how crazy we are for loving violence and how fake television is, yet it is entirely fake itself by trying to manipulate the audience at every turn. Jennifer Lawrence is fine and Josh Hutcherson is okay, but Liam Hemsworth's acting is a joke. Every single plot turn is telegraphed and made so abundantly clear that somebody could be not watching the movie, walk in in the middle of it, and guess how it will turn out by one glance at the screen. The direction is uninspired, the film is overlong and packed to the brim with filler. Honesty, much of the beginning drags on for too long. My personal favorite part was where Woody Harrelson's character gives Jennifer Lawrence advice and she promptly ignores it. The CGI in the film is horrendous and almost comical. At one point, they approach the capital and Hutcherson's character remarks something along the lines of it, ""Wow look at it"" and all I could think of was changing it to say, ""Wow, look at it, a CGi city in the mountains"". That is how bad the CGI is. It looks like everything was overexposed. The costume design is beyond peculiar with everyone wearing bizarre get ups and weirdo hairdos. I honestly have no idea why this was done. The premise on its own is idiotic. Sacrificing 12-18 year olds to be killed every year to punish them for rebelling? Yeah, that's certainly very likely. I like dystopian ideas as much as the next guy, but let's be real here. The character development is awful, matching up with the bad script that really has a blast at giving forced exposition through any means necessary. It wants to try and pretend to develop these characters, so it tosses in a few nonsense flashback sequences that add nothing to the overall film. Lucky us. One of the few redeeming factors here is the interesting world it designed. Though I think the premise is dumb, the world itself is compelling enough to make me curious how it all turns out in the end. Plus, the action is pretty well shot and the thrills the film produces are satisfying enough, even if they are entirely derivative. The film looks good enough on the whole to make me accept its many flaws to the point that I did not entirely hate the movie, but it is quite bad. Overall, The Hunger Games truly made me hunger for a better film.","MAR 10, 2016",3,Thriller
The Hunger Games,"Hollywood PG-13 version of ''Battle Royale'' full of meaningless dialogues, uninteresting characters in ridiculous costumes and a script so bad it's only comparable to ""Twilight"".","NOV 20, 2015",1,Thriller
The Hunger Games,"The Hunger Games can be summed up like this: the good is heavily outweighed by the bad. Only fans of the books should view it to see if they can get an ounce of satisfaction from the film adaptation. For everyone else, don't waste your time.","DEC 10, 2013",1,Thriller
The Hunger Games,"Read the book last year; saw the movie tonight. Completely disappointed with the overall adaptation. There was virtually no backstory, the characters felt very empty, and plenty of crucial plot points were glossed over. Why was Katniss so protective of Rue and emotional upon her death? Why did the riots start in District 12 so suddenly? Where was Katniss's gradual realization that cozying up to Peeta would lead to more sponsored parachutes? Where was the scene of the girl in the forest being captured (who eventually turned into an Avox)? Why were Katniss and Peeta acting so normal when they were presented with so much delicious food on the train (assuming they were on the brink of starvation back in District 12)? Where were the scenes where Panem's citizens were hinging on every move between Peeta/Katniss? Who the heck was Gale and what does he even have to do with this movie? All of these questions and MORE were left unanswered, and if it wasn't for me having read the book, I would have been sorely confused by the movie's shallow delivery. The only reason this movie deserves a 3 from me (instead of a 0), is because Jennifer Lawrence is a great actress. But not even she could save this lame duck of an adaptation.","JUL 2, 2013",3,Thriller
The Hunger Games,"A poor rip-off of Battle Royale. I'm pretty sure the book is interesting, but this movie was a gross disaster. A bunch of unexplained cut-scene, poorly constructed story, illogical actions. Very disapointed and I really don't see why people like this?","AUG 21, 2012",2,Thriller
The Hunger Games,"Flat characterisation and story development with juvenile depictions of the brutal subject it was approaching. Such was this, that the costume and set design were very much bloated. The romance is too focused and seems less keen on exploring the themes of creating a society based on the treatment of competition between young people by killing each other. First and foremost, you didn't have to see the film to know how it ended. A feeling that that was how it was going to end was illustrated under the unconvincing panic of its main protagonists who would miraculously appear in the sequel. Seeing as how I had never read the books, I felt as if was some kind of condescending response to those who genuinely wanted to see the film but had never read the books.","OCT 22, 2013",3,Thriller

The scenes looked very 'bright and happy', so did the soldiers uniforms, also, is it just me or does everyone have clothes always look good as new and the characters have minimal amounts of dirt on them too? In the movie story things that are extremely unlikely happened then something else extremely unlikely happened to make it follow the book.

Gone Girl,"David Fincher was, for a long time, my favourite director, and, with films like Gone Girl, it is not hard to see why. Gone Girl is a thrilling and emotionally jarring piece of cinema that subverts the romance and crime genres into a more modern and bleaker world. The film is also one of the first to explore the impact that “fake news” and rhetorically driven pundits have on society. While these elements are present in the book from which the film is adapted, Fincher takes them and throws them under the magnifying glass. The most remarkable thing about the movie, however, is that Tyler Perry, of noted Medea fame, gives a great performance. All players give great performances. Affleck likely giving the best of his career so far. Gone Girl is so insanely purposeful with all its elements that it feels as if the viewer is watching a real news story unfold. At times the movie is manipulative, but it does so admittingly and in a manner that is simultaneously thematically and socially driven. Fincher works excellently with crime subjects. Pieces like Se7en and Gone Girl show that he understands the genre as it currently exists and as it will exist in the future. Gone Girl starts with a steady gallop, but once it gets going it never stops until it gets right back where it started. In a way, the end is built into the beginning, but the middle gives context to the end.","SEP 15, 2018",9,Thriller

If you like movies, whose development you can't guess, this one is for you. An intricate story, almost insane.. not almost, but you know. This movie shows how some people pain can become a madness, that is rooted in complete revenge. The protagonist Amy is hiding is hiding behind a mask of a successful, intelligent and independent woman, who has many hobbies, can handle with everything and is also happy. In fact, that's what her parents want her to be and how they actually see her. She found a guy, that change her life and make her really happy, but then he turn out to be a **** selfish person, who start ignoring her and act like she is nothing. Sooo the revenge comes and it's so satisfying. . Outstanding acting, fascinating story with unbelievable plot twist. Must watch for thriller fans out there!","MAR 27, 2018",10,Thriller
Gone Girl,"David Fincher to me is one of the most talented directors around today, and while Se7en from personal opinion is his best film Gone Girl is up there with his best. Fincher directs with his usual superb class, giving the film great style and keeping the story alive(Gone Girl is easily one of the year's best directed films), and the whole film looks absolutely great with brooding lighting that evokes the creepy atmosphere brilliantly and Gone Girl is also a film that makes good use of digital, after seeing many directors over-using or cheapening it it was refreshing to see the technique done with taste. Trent Rezner and Atticus Ross's music score gives the film a haunting vibe and adds much to the unsettling intensity that a lot of the film(at least two-thirds worth), managing to not do it in an in-your-face manner. The use of sound mixing was interesting and came off cleverly, almost like a distant thought process. Gone Girl also has a brilliantly written and adapted script that does a great job balancing dark humour- that's not overused and is often hilarious- and suspense mystery (The Cool Girl monologue in particular is a masterpiece of script-writing, one of my favourite film monologues ever), while the story(apart from taking a bit of time to get starting) is absorbing from start to finish, rich in detail and characterisation and is filled with shocks and unpredictable twists that will be guaranteed to leave you reeling. That it is adapted from superb source material(one of the best books I've read in recent memory actually) helps it, and that it is faithful to it is commendable, a case of being faithful to the source material actually coming off wonders rather than being bogged down by being too faithful. The not-what-they-seem characters are incredibly interesting and richly developed, especially Amy who is one of the most chilling female characters of the year. And the acting is one of the high points of the film, as good as Fincher's direction and the score are it's Rosamund Pike's knockout turn as Amy in restrained- she only has to raise an eyebrow or something like that and it says a lot- but quite terrifying mode(especially in the third act) that makes the film. It will be a great surprise if she isn't at least nominated because it is easily her best performance. Ben Affleck has the other not-what-they-seem role and plays it with oozing charm and brooding intensity, while Neil Patrick Harris surprisingly excels in a very against-type role(who knew he could be sinister?) and Tyler Perry oozes charisma and is very funny. Carrie Coon is the standout in support, it's a tricky role and the moral compass of the film but Coon is touchingly likable in it. The ending does for my liking end too suddenly and the storytelling got implausible and lazy at this point, but apart from that Gone Girl was a winner and one of the best of the year. 9/10 Bethany Cox","MAR 20, 2022",9,Thriller

The ending of this movie is so satisfying and shocking, and I won't spoil anything about it! Gone Girl is a very cleverly done meta of a film. At it's core, this is a movie about secrets, manipulation, lies, and ultimately a conflict between men, women, and how relationships are perceived by society vs. how relationships actually are. The performances by Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are jaw dropping. Easily their best work. Carrie Coon is incredible as always, and even Tyler Perry busts out some great acting chops.

Gone Girl,"There are movies that make you ponder marriage/relationships -- yours and other people's. This isn't one of them. Nick and Amy are (one hopes!) nothing like you and your significant other. Their twisty story is darkly funny and provocative, although I think I might have enjoyed it more had I not read the novel. (Same plot problems, in my opinion.) Ben Affleck -- whose acting was the worst thing in ""Argo"" -- is the best thing here, perfectly cast. Rosemund Pike is a weak link, seeming like an American Doll whose descriptive theme is ""sociopath."" Trent Reznor's score is not so much a soundtrack as just sound effects.","OCT 3, 2014",6,Thriller

Gone Girl,"There are some heavy hitting names on the screen, and behind the camera. But this is a plot not even worthy of a lifetime movie. The only believable character is the media savvy lawyer. Seriously, NPH as a love interest? A woman gone missing, who has the national spotlight, goes to a mall, and nobody notices her? Then Ben Affleck takes her back at the end? I dont want to spoil it too much, but the things that happen that the characters overlook is laughable. Who does this stuff? It is just a ridiculous plot. The movie has about the same basis in reality as Star Wars. I wanted to watch this and like it. After ""The Town"" I made a point of seeing this because Ben Affleck and David Fincher. But it is just preposterous.","OCT 4, 2014",4,Thriller
Gone Girl,"This is a difficult movie to rate because its strengths and weaknesses are tangled together. I have not read the book, and I'm reviewing the film as its own entity. The movie’s worth seeing, if only because of the twists, the character of Amy, and the post-movie talking points that are meant to provoke a battle of the sexes debate. I did enjoy Fincher branching out in a new direction, and I wouldn't say that it's the wrong direction for him as much as it was a difficult tone to hit for anyone. The movie sets out to mix melodrama, realistic satire and absurdism. Though I love weird tones and shifting tones, to me the tones in Gone Girl don't always land well or mix well. Worse still, there’s inconsistent acting, and wobbly story logic. The movie isn’t deliberately unreal enough (whether absurd or dreamlike or mythic or farcical etc) to get away with the wobbly story logic. I'm not sure the actors are always successful at staying in the same movie together, as mentioned by user-reviewer benutty. And Affleck (as A-lister personality actors often do) seems to be so intent on 'playing a character with a backbone' that it's basically frigid, unflinching acting where his 'character' doesn't really change or have an interior. We're left watching Affleck bring the role to himself so entirely that he's not really doing anything. It's just flat acting that has about the same tone all the way through. (And it's not unlike the frigidity that Casey Affleck has in Gone Baby Gone, directed by Ben Affleck) I think this is partly dismissible by the character's degree of narcissism and shallowness, but not entirely. But… I have toyed around with the idea that Fincher and Flynn are jazzing around metafictionally here. I’m not convinced that they are, or that they did it well if intended. But at some point, two intelligent artists may have discussed how a man is to direct a woman’s novel/screenplay of this sort. IF they baked a metafiction joke into it, the setup clearly runs through Affleck’s under-emoting, under-engaged acting that undermines the story, and through the way that nearly every story logic problem serves to make Amy more amazing. And the meta-joke, if there is one, only plays if you see the characters as puppets, more or less: The psychopathically overengaged, self-justified modern wife who gets to always be right, and the self-centered, resentful boy-husband who takes her just barely seriously enough to subtly manipulate back and stay alive. Yet... I'm not sure I want to give Affleck the benefit of the doubt that his practically unchanging tone and lack of interior were all just a brilliant meta-joke.","OCT 5, 2014",6,Thriller
Gone Girl,"I refuse to join the chorus of applause for this film. Gone Girl is predictably Fincher-ish--visually stylish and slick but cold and soulless. I find both lead performances entirely vacant and robotic, with Rosamund Pike's Amy Dunne bordering on having been inspired by Haley Joel Osment in A.I. While the supporting cast steals the show (Lisa Banes, Lola Kirke and Neil Patrick Harris are highlights for me), Carrie Coon's Margo seems to have come from an entirely different film where all the actors weren't told they were making a film noir parody. On a positive note, there are three moments emblazoned in my memory where Cronenweth's photography is quite remarkable.","OCT 2, 2014",5,Thriller
Gone Girl,"Round about the two hour mark I found myself wishing that Nick would kill Amy, or she would kill him, or some good Samaritan would step up and kill both of them, just so I would be saved sitting through a further 29 minutes of this film. Gone Girl is not without merit. The cast does a fine job with the material, and someone obviously turned on their thinking cap while organizing the various plot points, but this isn't Hitchcock, and after about ninety minutes the film starts getting tedious. The problem of course is that neither Nick nor Amy appear to have any redeeming characteristics. It's more a matter of which one you dislike more. Ultimately, perhaps the worst crime is the refusal of the local police to further their investigation. This is not explained and I can imagine no justification other than ""convenience of the producers"". I would have given this film a 6 out of 10 till I realized that a 6 would tally up as ""favorable"" when my reaction is decidedly ""mixed"". All in all it's not a bad film, it just isn't particularly engaging.","FEB 22, 2015",5,Thriller
Gone Girl,"Gillian Flynn's book 'Gone Girl' is one of the best novels that I have read in years. It has great characters, intrigue and a bold ending that would definitely not be to everyone's taste. It's a real intelligent page turner that once started can't be put down. The problem with 'Gone Girl' the film is that it has been so faithfully adapted, too faithfully even, by Flynn herself that there are no surprises to be had. I acknowledge that this sounds churlish when there are so many book adaptations that are bad, but the lack of surprise unfortunately dulls the movie experience. The film is well cast. The setting feels right and the score sets an appropriate tone. However, David Fincher's unfussy direction does nothing to add an extra visual dimension to the story. As a result I felt somewhat disappointed by my own reaction, even whilst rationalising the reason for it. As already stated the actors are almost perfect fits for their roles. Ben Affleck is better than I had expected and really carries the film. Rosamund Pike, although over praised, is still good and the supporting cast are pretty much spot on, with a special mention to Neil Patrick Harris. The sequences that involve him are amongst the best in the film. In summation I can only say that for people who have not read the book this should be a most rewarding experience. Fans of the source material, however, might want to think a little harder about there expectations before viewing.","OCT 3, 2014",6,Thriller

Gone Girl,"I hereby support a constitutional amendment prohibiting ANYONE from comparing any film to ""Hitchcock"" unless Hitchcock directed it. The dialogue is so pretentious, the line deliveries so forced, the plot elements so preposterous that it's like watching a bad acting class. There's no one in the film remotely interesting. I picked up the novel just to see if they had done the author an injustice, and was astonished that people rave about the book. Ugh: this is what movies have become? And this is great fiction? Pretentious, preposterous, and with a Lifetime Achievement Award for Bad Endings in a thriller, both book and film division. Gillian Flynn is not Dashiell Hammett, she's Patricia Cornwell light, and the film is a lot more Brian DiPalma than it ever will be Hitchcock. At least it reinforces the notion that Ben Affleck is a far better director than actor.","DEC 24, 2014",4,Thriller

Gone Girl,"I will start saying that this movie deserves to be watched. First 2/3 are really good. But then the end kinda ruins it. Now the spoilers... It all begins when Gone Girl drops a bag full of cash (in a very stupid scene) and gets herself robbed, pushing her to call a friend for help. Then he takes her to a house full of cameras, where she makes a very lame scene pretending to be mistreated in front **** door that she could easily break and escape. Not to mention the cameras would definitely show her arriving to the house not as a prisoner. Anyway, the FBI believes her with no investigation after she kills the guy and claims self defense. Absurd much? Finally, she gets pregnant from some old frozen sperm and uses that to get the husband not to leave her. Again, an aggression to logic. If the writer wanted her to triumph at the end, she should have thought of a better way to do it because this awful, full of holes, ending doesn't work. It's a shame because the movie deserved more than that.","DEC 29, 2015",6,Thriller

I asked my wife (who read the book) and she said that in the book they did a lot better at making you believe it was him. That may be part of the reason for my dislike. Overall the movie was mediocre. The acting was ok, and for the most part the story was good. Not great, but good, could have been a lot better. The big beef I had with this movie, was the terrible ending... I mean commmme on! Like anyone would actually just stay with her, give me a f'in break!

Along the way, you're not sure who did what, and the flashbacks suggest a particular outcome. Up to a certain point it is mysterious if not very slow. Then it becomes a bit clever and intricate as details emerge. The third act at the lake house is surprising, compelling and confronting. But the final sequence reeks. There are so many loose ends which would deliver justice but none are explored or even acknowledged.

Gone Girl,"I was very disappointed with this movie. It built the suspense quite well but then all of a sudden the characters began acting wildly out of character. One character who was portrayed as extremely intelligent in the beginning of the film began acting as if they had suddenly had a frontal lobotomy. The other character who was portrayed as an ethical person suddenly lost all their moral sense. Perhaps something was missing in the film that was in the book, but I cannot see how the last third of the film realistically would have followed from the first, well-done (except for the very annoying music) 2/3 of the film.

As someone who has studied psychology, none of the character acted realistically, whether they were psychopaths or not. That is not how those people behave. And even if you want to call it a satire, well it showed me nothing new as I already know the media influences the mob mentality in various ways which is something I knew about 10 years ago. If you needed to see Gone Girl to figure that our you are about as smart as the moron mob depicted in the film. This film showed me nothing new, was not entertaining, was not funny, and wasn't even a good plot since it was so convoluted and predictable, and mostly laughably stupid.

Even suspending disbelief to enjoy some of the wildly implausible aspects of the plot (and there are MANY to choose from), there are ridiculous 180-degree character shifts that occur with nearly no explanation, development or understanding in order to propel this train wreck into the station. Ben Affleck is cast perfectly as the unfaithful husband as it usually doesn't take more than a single frame to make Ben Affleck unlikable (I kid!) but he's hardly to blame here.

Gone Girl,"If this review were boiled down to two words “depraved bulls--t” would be it. This review covers both the book & the movie as well as the social media storm that was kicked up by both. I spotted several posts on ""Gone Girl"" while on YouTube w titles like ""Why we all admire Amy"" & ""Why you root for Amy Dunne"" placed alongside a post on YouTube's ""Analyzing Evil"" series where Amy was mentioned among such evil heavyweights like Anton Chigurh & Michael Corleone. That was quite the spread. Intrigued, I picked up the DVD expecting a story about a put upon a woman who outdoes an abusive husband, but then, less the book's internal monologues the movie's polarizing effect kicks in. Amy reveals herself as a wacko with Munchausen's syndrome. The movie at this point still made sense; Nick was an insensitive lout & Amy a ticking time bomb. She devises a plan where she disappears & through carefully planted evidence implicates her husband with her murder. Then the movie began to get flaky. A whole slew of unbelievable plot twists follow. Amy retracts her disappearance/murder plan (she had to after she was robbed of her cruise money). She rapidly comes up with an alternate plan where she hooks up with an ex-boyfriend (who I believe was watching the news…yet he did not question the legal consequences obsessed puppy that he was) &, after considering wheedling escape money from him, decides...after hearing Nick apologize on **** murder him mid-orgasm via slashing his throat & make it look like he was **** her via self-mutilation (makes sense, huh?). A truly desperate & despicable act that should have been her undoing. But no, the movie/book juggernaut continues... The fact that she returns home all bloodied up for the press (how did they get there? Is the press supposed to believe that a woman in her apparent mental state could methodically orchestrate a media event!?) all that plus the fact that the FBI did not confiscate Amy's bloodied blouse or run a forensic examination on her but let her return home with it put the story beyond belief. OK, she was on meds, Fed procedure; you hold her in the hospital pending further questioning. With this stretch, the movie veers off into ""Basic Instinct"" territory with the entire set of FBI agents huddled at the far end of the room like they were afraid of asking hard questions. It took a local law enforcement figure (a detective Boney, who was on the case from the beginning) to at least attempt a few questions about her ""**** chronicles"" diary about Nick & why given all that was she so happy to be back in her tormentor's arms. She got hushed up by the Feds because this is Gillian Flynn's world where everything is sh-t & sunshine is not permitted. Also, the fertility clinic did not bear out that she was inseminated by them, claiming that they dumped Nick's sperm. This contradiction puzzled me but whatever she got a hold of Nick's j--z (hypothetical dialect; ""I'll take this & inseminate myself in the ladies room THANK YOU VERY MUCH""). ALSO, sperm has a shelf life of 15 minutes. Not believable. OK (we swallow hard with the last **** SPITTING PLEASE), so... she keeps up her game with Nick by telling him she was impregnated. This after she tries to get him into the sack with her (just the thing one wants to do after telling the press you were imprisoned by a crazed ex-boyfriend; NOT BELIEVABLE). Finally, I believe that Nick was sincere when he told his sister he had responsibility for the child. For once Nick had the moral upper hand saying this but let us not kid ourselves about Amy. In the sarcastic way she said ""That's marriage"" there's no doubt that she was going to continue to manipulate everybody in arms reach to preserve control. That unfortunately would include the kid. In the end, Amy had no cards left to dupe Nick or anyone w/in Nick's family. Unfortunately, she certainly had a full deck with the media. A way unlikely end to a pointless & depressing movie. Nick wasn't looking to ""win"" he was looking to reconcile. Then he got wind of what Amy did to Desi, but Amy didn't need to repent didn't she? Gillian Flynn could have generated a better drama by humanizing Amy in having her get nailed by Detective Boney & the FBI. Instead, she greased Amy's exit in a manner that was both unrealistic & infuriating. This brings me back to the YouTube posts put up by Amy's cheerleaders that show a willingness to promote this piece of cinematic poison as a rallying point. At first blush the movie seems male misogynistic, which would give Amy a ""hero"" status. However, after watching, reading (Yes, I did this in reverse order) & digesting this brick of a book & mess of a movie was there ANYTHING sympathetic about her? She was a complete & wildly improbable monster. No, this movie was FEMALE misogynistic. Yet you have deluded ""fans"" who present her as a role model.

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"Since the first novel was released in 2008, The Hunger Games series has become one of the biggest YA franchises on the market, and it's been probably the only series to legitimately rival the Harry Potter franchise in sheer popularity. Although The Maze Runner and Divergent have enjoyed enough success to spawn their own film adaptations, neither have been nearly as lucrative as The Hunger Games. The franchise's complicated and timely hero as well as its biting political subtext has attracted many people to the series, and seven years, later the final film has been released to close the series. To get ready for it, I decided to watch the penultimate chapter, Mockingjay: Part 1. After destroying the arena at the 75th Annual Hunger Games, Katniss is brought to the underground District 13 in order to assume her identity as the Mockingjay, a symbol of hope and rebellion for the people of Panem. However, Katniss's hope begins to burn out when she realizes that Peeta was captured by the Capitol and is being brainwashed to convince the people to stop the rebellion. Even as a fan of the series, splitting the final book into two parts felt less like a narrative enhancement and more like an attempt to make more money. Some scenes seemed to drag on too long or be completely unnecessary. The book could easily be adapted into an epic three-hour conclusion and still be effective. There was also much less action than the previous films. However, the action scenes that were present are as poignant and exciting as ever. The series' strengths have always outweighed its issues, and Mockingjay: Part 1 is no exception. Jennifer Lawrence is still mesmerizing in her portrayal of Katniss, and the social commentary is just as timely and striking as it is in the other films. It may feel like too much exposition for the conclusion, but The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1 is a grim and exciting set-up for a hopefully action-packed finale.","NOV 23, 2015",8,Thriller

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"A good third film of the franchise, with great performances and a quite interesting script, which focus on politics and advertising. Some fans might be disappointed with the lack of action if compared to the two previous movies but this political analyses is amazing.

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"If you're riding the fast paced, energetic thrills of Catching Fire then you might be let down by Mockingjay Part 1. It's slower and more plot focused, thus there's barely any action in it. But if you're up for a more propaganda heavy focus at a rebellion, the film completely delivers on that aspect.","DEC 16, 2016",7,Thriller
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"Definitely not the best film in the series but still worth watching. The always emotional Hunger Games series does not let up in this part 1 to the final film of the franchise. Jennifer Lawrence gives another incredible performance as Katniss; which in my opinion is the main piece of the puzzle that makes this film franchise more than just another set of teen films. Julianne Moore and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman also play their parts very well and give film just another added layer to make it even more enjoyable. Elizabeth Banks continues to be one the best parts of the series and gives another awesome performance as Effie. Overall, the second to last installment has its emotional scenes and keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat till the very end.","JAN 7, 2015",7,Thriller
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"Enjoyable for sure, but not as good as the first or Catching Fire for that matter.

However, it of course suffers from a partially unsatisfying cliffhanger ending, and very little development is given to the few new characters.","FEB 19, 2015",7,Thriller

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"Decent, But Big Drop In Quality Now I understand this is only part 1, But this should’ve been better written in all honesty, But I still liked the film at least 72% of the time.","JUN 23, 2019",7,Thriller
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"As I have read all three books and have now seen all the released movies I can safely say that I do believe that the Hunger Games franchise is in safe hands. For both people who have read the books or who have only seen the films I think they will be satisfied. I was sceptical at first whilst going into the movie and yet I was intrigued to see how the narrative would play out on screen. I personally felt that the third book in the Hunger Games Trilogy “Mockingjay” was the most monotonous and disengaging out of the lot, so when I heard that Lionsgate was going to split the novel into two I like most people thought it was a heartless cash grab that would not pay off. Mockingjay Part 1 is by no means better than the other two previous instalments of the series but it is not however a bad film contradictory of some of the other more naïve reviews. It serves (as I had hoped) as an engaging build up for the final chapter in the Hunger Games cinematic series. Although I still think that it was not right to split Mockingjay up, the first part has proved to be better than I thought and I walked out of the cinema feeling exited for the finale. For people who have not read the books and have only watched the “Hunger Games” and “Catching Fire” I have to mention that the movie is a complete deviation from the practically identical structure of the other two films. Mockingjay Part 1 delves deeper as you might expect into the intricacies of building a revolution against the capitol. If you enjoyed the two movies purely for the spectacle of the arena and the survival element of the plot you will not like this movie but if you are invested in the acting talents of this series you are more likely to see this movie as an enjoyable cinematic experience. For people who have read the book I will say that Mockingjay Part 1 is a pleasant surprise. I thought like the book the film would be dull and slow paced. The first two thirds of this film are worth your time even if the final part felt a little stretched. All of the Mockingjay book by Suzanne Collins was a disappointment for me but I think the plot has been rectified and showcased properly in this film. The film unlike the book expands on Collin’s world, in a subtle way and gives you more of an insight into the establishment of opposing propaganda clips which I found thoroughly entertaining and interesting (this was not depicted so much in the book). I would have given this film a 5 instead of a 7 if it was not for the superb talents of Jennifer Lawrence & the late Philip Seymour Hoffman. Their performances arguably carry the story and do not falter throughout the duration of the movie. Hoffman’s intellectual and shockingly comedic portrayal of Plutarch Heavensbee is yet another reminder of what a great character actor who we have lost and who will miss in the foreseeable future. This movie includes a solid soundtrack and outstandingly realistic special effects. If you have enjoyed the acting and the characters you will like this movie. If you didn't like Mockingjay the book try out this feature because it may as I found surpass your expectations. This movie has at the very least made me want to rush to see the final film which I suppose was its primary function as a studio cash grab. Even now I think that this time next year when the final movie of the Hunger Games has come and gone I may even be a little upset when I come to realize that it is all over.","JAN 5, 2015",7,Thriller
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"I was kinda worried for the first 30 minutes because of my disappointment with Catching Fire, but i'm glad that their back on the track because i really love Mockingjay - Part 1, this is what i like, a continuation of a story that is actually original and not doing the same thing again, The Hunger Games world has some of the best movie politics conflict i've ever experienced, and specifically in this one, it felt so real, so horrifying, the intensity, the atmosphere, and all the cast performance especially Jennifer Lawrence in her best performance in the franchise, it's powerful, it's exciting, never i've experience such a threat in a movie this well done, and if Catching Fire have any positive aspects in terms of the story then it was definitely the impact from it, if there is no Catching Fire there is no Mockingjay - Part 1 even though Catching Fire was a disappointment for me, anyway, overall Mockingjay - Part 1 serves an incredibly powerful storytelling that really works as a sequel, and it does at the end might possibly be one of the best movie sequel ever made for me personally and it's only half of the story, and hopefully Part 2 delivers.","NOV 18, 2023",10,Thriller
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"This film is the third in the adaptation of the literary trilogy by Suzanne Collins, but, unlike the first two films, it brings only part of the last book to the cinema. I didn't read them, I have no particular intention of doing so for any particular reason, so I will ignore the books and focus on the film. In this film, we follow Katniss' first steps as a revolutionary. After being rescued from the arena and recovering from her injuries, she discovers that she is with a group of rebels, the same ones who allegedly lost the civil war seventy-five years earlier, the same ones who inhabit the supposedly extinct District 13. After all, everything was a lie. Everything was a manoeuvrer by Snow's regime to hide the existence of a strong movement of political contestation. Alma Coin, the head of the Resistance, asks for Katniss's support, wants her to become a symbol, a mascot. But she only thinks about the fate of her friends, especially Peeta, who is in Snow's power and seems to have been brainwashed. Well, after the second film turned out to be excellent it was difficult to do better, but it was totally possible to match it. I don't think that happened, although it is very close. This continues to be an excellent film and to be within a standard that does not clash or belittle the other two. I just don't seem to have managed to be that good. To begin with, I hate when a film based on a book splits into two halves, it is almost always a sign that there is immense straw that could be perfectly removed in an editing room by a skilled editor. The film, in fact, drags a little more than those that preceded it, but if the audience gets involved in the story it ends up not even noticing much. It is also a film that has a lot of sci-fi, the most focused on that genre in all of tetralogy. Jennifer Lawrence has remained excellent, but it brings nothing that we have not seen. In addition, attempts to create a romantic plot around her character are weak and cold, whatever the target of Katniss's interest. Donald Sutherland continues to surprise and now gives us an almost perfect villain, in his megalomania, narcissism and thirst for control and power. He is truly an exceptional actor, at his best. Stanley Tucci was much more serious and restrained in the way he brought Cesar, a sensationalist TV host, to life, but it reveals how his character is just a puppet of the regime. Elizabeth Banks is an actress who reveals herself in this film, thanks to the profound mental and psychological transformation that her character will undergo here, and Woody Harrelson gains strength and seriousness, as she becomes one of the most fervent supporters of ""Mockingjay"". Julianne Moore alternates between contained sweetness and charismatic strength and presence; Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright and Jena Malone are very good, but they don't do much more than they ask. Josh Hutcherson continues to sound weird, although in this film this is almost required by the character. In addition to a great cast and a good story, the film has excellent production values: careful cinematography with good contrast, excellent sets and costumes and great CGI and sound effects that make fights and combats seem like they want to get off the screen . The soundtrack also deserves special mention for its effectiveness and beauty. Composed by James Newton Howard, it is one of those that remains in the ear long after we have seen the film. Full of action and with an excellent story, this film is excellent, although it is not as engaging and intense as the film that preceded it. It drags on more, some scenes seem to be expendable, but that's what happens when, for money, a book unfolds in two films.","MAY 2, 2020",8,Thriller
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"For those of you that read the series of books you will like the 3rd installment. I found it to be true to the book and well put together, just like I would have imagined it while reading. For those of you that didn't read the book you will be somewhat disappointed as it isn't about the Hunger Games, but more about the uprising of the districts and the revolution taking place. As I have enjoyed the first two movies, I thought once again much thought has taken place with the casting as they have been true to the characters in the book. Also much to my surprise, the 3rd has taken the time to be true to the setting and the scenery depicted in the 3rd book.

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"In my opinion, unlike the first two films, it is a much better film. The other films were good in terms of explaining the subject and showing virtual games and events. As someone who could not enjoy the parts of the Hunger Games, I liked the real action in this movie. A film that shows how difficult a process revolutions are and how dictators behave. The hopes and faith of the people in the region in the film remind me of the times of the National Forces. Apart from these good times, I would also like to point out that I experienced moments in the movie that made me angry. I haven't read the books, but as it says in the movie, Katniss was 15 years old. If I were to give her age, I could understand her meaningless tripping and confused mind, but in the movie, she didn't look like she was 15 at all, so her constant tripping and crying annoyed me. Of course, this shows that the actor performs well and the script is good. I think the second episode will have much more action and emotion, and I keep my expectations very high. I hope I'm not wrong.","MAR 16, 2017",7,Thriller
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"Great blockbuster that continues the unexpected quality run this franchise is having. It is not as entertaining as Catching Fire (which was pretty much a perfect blockbuster) but the acting is equally great or better, with Jennifer Lawrence owning the role once more, and also Josh Hutcherson doing a fantastic job. I also liked Julianne Moore a lot as the new leader. I have to say I am very glad that a blockbuster with few action in it can be this successful and become the biggest box office hit of the year, so glad. This new chapter is definitely all about the propaganda war and the definitive birth of a revolution, which does not mean it lack very tense scenes. A great watch. I give it a 7.5 out of 10.

Katniss is at District 13, President Coin (Moore) wants her to be the mockingjay defend for herself, peta, her family and District 13. she **** the games forever, cause President Snow turns society/capital into a living nightmare. Coin uses Everdeen as a weapon then Snow ( who is played very well by Donald Sutherland) uses her love Peta against the capital. the plot is definitely interesting and the suspense is pure gold! and i was on the edge of my seat. I definitely enjoyed this movie alot i can't wait part 2. Grade A- (the reason why i gave an A- is Natalie Dormer's character).","JAN 23, 2015",10,Thriller
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"Another great part of Hunger Games and great movie about dictatorship. Again there are some improvements to the predecessor: First, the world of Panem, the dialogues and the story around dictatorship are perfectly made: Donald Sutherland as Snow is very impressive and convincing, the perfect villain. Also I noticed, that the main topic of the franchise is propaganda, my favourite theme. The 2nd part of the movie is more action orientated and they had some flaws in the first and second Hunger Games. But in this movie they were tense, maybe because it was not so clear if the good guys will survive this and the bunker scenes were also nice. In addition I liked, that this movie was a bit different than the first two: no more games, but real war. Another improvement: Jennifer Lawrence was finally convincing. **** I like the dark, threatening atmosphere. There was one element that I dislike a lot: Julianne Moore. I cant watch her, she is simply too ugly to be shown, lol. And I didnt understand, why suddenly Katniss was so much in love with Peeta, although Gale fits better to her (see the first movie) and their ralationship was more a fake.","JUL 14, 2022",9,Thriller
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"This ""Young Adult Sci-Fi"" flick is much smarter than most. There is less flamboyant action, because it tries and more often than not succeeds in telling a story about the things which make a revolution work like myth building and sacrifice and propaganda.

As I mentioned in the previous review, there was a good background to establish the universe - and so: the characters; but the development here seemed null to me. It's as if the characters just move forward. The relationship between Peeta and Katness is an example of how forced something can become without due attention. There are some elements that are removed for pure convenience and this started to bother me a lot, which makes me leave the suspension of disbelief aside, which delegitimizes the entire film - but no, that hasn't happened yet.

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"'Mockingjay Part 1' is a reminder that splitting and dragging out a relatively small book into two films, while a great financial scheme for studios, kills the value of its story. Where 'Catching Fire' had those who hadn't read the series, (Me!,) captivated, Part 1 crashes back to reality, and reveals the flaws of the franchise. Katniss, a character you could root for as a strong female protagonist, falls right back into the Hollywood trap of being entirely dependent on a man, and even manages to make her more gullible, naive, and unlikable than she ever was in the first two films. The story's initial premise, as a battle of political ad campaigns, with both sides taking their shots back and forth, is interesting, but falls victim to slow pacing a repetitive story points. While 'Catching Fire' managed to infuse its political commentary into an engaging story, here we are treated to overblown politics with very little engaging action. The supporting cast is a delightful but wasted treat, as former Academy Award winners are pushed into mainly support roles. This includes the late Phillip Seymour Hoffman, a real beam of light in the previous film, whose character serves no real arc in this part of the story. The plot suffers from the two-part problem, as there is no real pay-off or development of the characters, and it ends more abruptly and confusing than its predecessor. The movie grinds to a halt in some areas, with fake-tension scenes that have no real bearing on the overall plot. It comes to a breaking point when Katniss is literally teasing a cat with a flashlight, and suddenly discovers a realization she should have known from near the beginning of the film. Overall, a huge letdown based on what the previous films had set-up. Instead of leaving the non-book reading viewers wanting more, it leaves us with more of a deep sigh and leaves us wondering why we devoted our time to this series in the first place.","NOV 18, 2015",4,Thriller
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"Compared to other parts of the Hunger games this one really lacked something in my opinion. I mean, there weren't that many story parts in the movie and not much happened in my opinion, which would be worth mentioning. I think they just strecthed it out to two parts so that it would make more money (talking about Mockingjay parts). There weren't really much of emotional parts or really anything that interesting happenning which would make this a stand out movie.

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"The attempt to split the final act into two films is a mistake often seen nowadays and it ends in the same result every time. Whilst on the most part the Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 is an engaging movie, it is a distinct drop in quality in comparison to the two previous films. The film is far too slow paced and fails to capture the audience from start to finish. Despite this, there are redeeming qualities that make this film enjoyable to watch. The exploration of propaganda and the harsh realities of war are at some points demonstrated to perfection.

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"Mockingjay Part 1 allows a different view of all characters, scenes and current knowledge the audience possess of the games as a whole. As the point of the games is completely removed from the films presence. This therefore would add a unique edge as Katniss’ journey through fame and struggle for Peter is shown with great light. Nevertheless this consequence of light, leads to too much detail which appears of an excess through the duration of the film, as the main climax only lied between the scenes of reuniting Katniss and Peter. Even so the tension through the stories concept was fulfilled with intelligent, bold, but obscure effects via scene distribution in Katniss’ (Jennifer Lawrence) anger which is well thought through in accordance to acting the role successfully. Additionally the growing admiration for Peter that develops through the film is complimented by the phenomenal representation in recreating the distress through costume design and makeup construction by layering and contouring, accurately executing his purpose during the film, even though evidencing this purpose during the film could be improved, instead of the single resource of the TV analogy via scripture.","MAY 1, 2015",6,Thriller

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"Remember Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1, were nothing really exciting happens in that movie, and the movie has a slow paste run time and they try to save the all the exciting and awesome parts in part 2, and now we got Mockingjay and I can happily say that Mockingjay is a little better than Deathly Hallows Part 1, but it does lack of the two parter thing and this movie is not near from perfect. Mockingjay Part 1 continues the story has Katniss Everdeen along with Peeta Mellark, and a handful of other survivors, have successfully escaped the Quarterquell thanks to helps from Haymitch Abernathy and former gamemaster Plutarch Heavensbee. But escaping is just the start, as Katniss finds herself having to embrace the symbol she has become to the people of Panem - a symbol of rebellion against President Snow and the autocratic Capitol. I was really looking forward to Mockingjay, because I thought the squeal (Catching Fire) was a big improvement and just overall a better movie then the first one. The trailer to Mockingjay won me over by it's excellent tone and it's brilliant shots, and I was actually counting down the days for the movie release, but now after seeing the film I got to say.... I'm a bit disappointing. Now let me get something out there, I don't hate this movie, I just think it's really disappointing for and please don't hate me for this. Let's start off with the good things in this movie: Jennifer Lawrence was just flawless in this movie and now every time I see her in interviews or new movies I straight away like her as a person and as a actress. Rest of the cast did good as well. The movie had that Apocalypse settings to it and it suited the tone of the film and I'm just happy they got that right. Now for the things that did not work at all and came off messy: The fact that this is a two parter really spoils the film for me, because without giving away anything, but basically this movie is just a set up for the next film and sometimes movies can pull that off, but when the the second part comes out not a lot really of people won't be talking about part 1 anymore, just like Harry Potter and I know I keep bring up Potter a lot but it's really hard not to. The movies pasting is like watching a snail starting walking to point A to point B, that's the movies paste right there. The movie really wants me to care about the character's and the character's may not be boring, but there not really that interesting to me. Overall Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 feels less then a stand alone film, but more of a cash grab and I hate saying that because I really wanted to like this and I trying my damn best, but I'm sorry for letting you all down but this movie was a disappointing to me and saying that ****.","MAR 9, 2015",6,Thriller
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"Back in 2010 Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 started a dangerous trend — splitting novel adaptations into multiple parts. Since then we’ve seen the Twilight series split its finale in two and (unforgivably) J.R.R Tolkien’s 300 page ‘The Hobbit’ turned into a three film, nine hour epic. So how does the latest entry in The Hunger Games franchise fare? To be honest, I think its pretty good. After two films of build up the oppressed people of Panem are finally taking up arms against a brutal, totalitarian regime led by Donald Sutherland’s President Snow. So you’d expect a lot of large scale action right? Na, we do get a lot of propaganda though. Here the Battle Royale style ‘games’ take a back seat as the two political entity’s battle for the hearts and minds of the population. The ideology of war and the effects of state run media are not often the subject of mainstream Hollywood films. To me however this has always been the most interesting element of the franchise, one that elevates it above the teenage, love triangle, blockbuster it is often dismissed as. I mean these films are so overtly political at this point that its even starting to negatively effect the box office takings in key worldwide markets. So does all this politics and propaganda make the film boring? Absolutely not. Jennifer Lawrence’s performance once again brings real emotion and depth to Katniss demanding empathy despite some tricky (and at times downright unlikeable) character traits. The extended running time also allows some of the series’ side characters to have some much needed development. Liam Hemsworth’s Gale and Elizabeth Banks’ Effie finally get scenes of their own, free from Katniss, where they can establish their own motivations and backgrounds. The returning cast also up their game. Josh Hutcherson is fantastic as Peeta (despite reduced screen time) showing real restraint when needed in scenes a lesser actor would overplay. Of course Donald Sutherland is on fine menacing form as President Snow. The only disappointment in terms of performance is the late, great, Philip Seymour Hoffman. Don’t get me wrong, he’s great, it just seems he's a little underused. It's a shame that what would turn out to be his final screen role is that of the rather subdued Plutarch Heavensbee. This is hardly a defining or particularly memorable posthumous role like Heath Ledgers Joker or Oliver Reed in Gladiator. Of course the filmmakers can’t be criticised for this and they show Hoffman the upmost respect, dedicating the film to his memory. Unfortunately much like The Deathly Hallows, Mockingjay Part 1 can’t escape the feeling of being connective tissue and not a film in its own right. This instalment could quite fairly be accused of simply being a two hour trailer for next years’ conclusion. It’s impossible not to see the irony in a film with a quite Marxist message (the downtrodden proletariat rising up against a powerful ruling class) being split in half by a Hollywood elite for commercial gain. But politics and commercialism aside, the fact remains that Mockingjay-Part 1 is a well made, well acted movie. In all honesty it probably shouldn’t exist but, as it does, there are far worse and less thought provoking ways to spend a couple of hours.","DEC 19, 2017",5,Thriller

The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"All through watching Mockingjay I thought somehow it feeling familiar... and I realised it reminded me a bit of the Harry Potter series and the point where Harry Potter got darker and more grown up. While the Potter franchise successfully transitioned from it's 12-year old demographic, The Hunger Games, did not quite manage so well. Not all is bad. There is some interesting criticism here of media and propaganda, but those are all smack -in-the-face type of observations. The film makes no secret of it. The darkness comes from the topic itself: the film is set in the aftermath of a violent crackdown by the Capitol onto the rebelling districts. It is dystopic, but what is missing is the emotion behind it. Jennifer Lawrence is more Jennifer Lawrence than Katniss, and when she is Katniss...well, Katniss is annoying. The consistent need to push her into doing what she has to do is quite frustrating. Mind you, it is (probably?) a limitation imposed in the Hunger Games books, but that still does not make her any less annoying and infuriating when she'd rather choose Peeta over the future of the whole world. Technically, the Hunger Games have polished up quite nicely. The CGI does not look as dated as it did in the first film, which is good. This film is very grim and dark - the colourful costumes of the Capitol have been replaced by the darkness of the underground shelter and the military uniform. Overall, though, the film sustains the continuation of a mediocre, yet entertaining, franchise. That being said, this one is the least entertaining film so far. The whole ""Part 1"" charade is a charade at its best. Not much really happens here, beyond some character ""development"" for Katniss (also known as everyone pushing her to get her act together). The first film is still the most engaging and entertaining one - let us hope they will end the series on a better note than Mockingjay Part 1, because otherwise, it will be a snooze.","JAN 29, 2016",5,Thriller
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"No doubt that the film was well-acted, but it was boring, because when you watch ""The Hunger Games"" film franchise, you always expect action scenes to be in the entire film or a grand part of it and this kind of stuff, but this one...

The cheap out on the viewer by skimping on the special effects in a lot of places. You get to watch some 1980's vector graphic triangle representation of a big scary bomber coming in to blow everyone up but you never get to see it, or anything actually go boom. Just a lot of dust falling from the ceiling of the bunker they all hide in. The rescue scene near the end was less than suspenseful. Gas everyone, go in, radio goes out. Wait a while. Everyone comes back. No shots fired, nothing interesting happens. The rest of the ""action"" scenes really made no sense. The thing with climbing trees to get away from guys with machine guns was just plain dumb. The unarmed people rushing the dam was a dumb and suicidal way to take it out. Looked like a poor-man's World War Z scene. Just wait, rent it before the second half comes out and watch it with Fast Forward being your friend.

It is the first time I ever felt like walking out in the middle of a movie. The amount of actual plot advancement of the Hunger Games story could have been contained in about 15 to 20 minutes, but we were forced to endure over 2 hours of ridiculous speeches, innumerable scenes of wrecked buildings and even silly cat tricks.

Instead Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) is holed up in with the rebels. Since she's won her Oscar, they gave her plenty of tear time. She spends most of the movie angry or sad, while the insurgents mold her image to lead the rebellion. The first hint of combat is almost an hour in and less than 2 minutes long. The only other action takes place entirely inside the security of a bunker. This is clearly a setup for the final installment, so it's best to avoid this one completely.","NOV 24, 2014",2,Thriller
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1,"What is it with the Hunger Games? Why is it that people everywhere treat it like its Shakespeare? Its just a teen novel based around an illogical Dystopian society. I haven't read the books, but i have seen the movies, and if the movies are anything like the book then I don't know what to do. This whole movie is just this: a commercial for Katnis. Plain and simple. It's for this whole, ""epic revolution"" that is occurring. But it is so boring; so uninteresting it amazes me at how much people like and praise it. My first gripe is that Katnis, or specifically Jennifer Lawrence has one expression throughout the entire movie,( surprising that she won an Oscar). She never smiles, she rarely cries,(only at the end,really), etc. ""But she is experiencing great pain over Peeta!"" Well, Peeta baisically did nothing so I don't know why. Also, Peeta? Just because his parents were bakers doesn't mean he should be named after a type of bread!!!! This whole movie is riddled with plot holes that are so easy to spot it's not even funny. 1: They bomb a whole district to rubble yet leave one house practically unschathed, (which I assume is Katnis's house or something). Either the Capital bombes have a really bad aim,( which is highly unlikely since a) they levelled the rest of the district and b) this society is technologically advanced). 2. They see Katnis land near a hospital but don't bomb the hospital until Katnis has left. They would have saved SO much time and resources if they just killed her there, but then it wouldn't be much of a movie, would it? AND, technically Katnis is the one who killed all those people in the hospital because she only went there for the equivalent of a photoshoot! 3. She takes down two bombers with a bow. ""But she was using explosive-tipped tips!"". Well, aren't bombers supposed to be flying at super-sonic speeds or something and fly at a slightly higher altitude? And this world looks pretty small, so why don't they just use missiles? I think this scene is only in the movie is to make up for how boring the rest of the movie is and o make Katnis look awesome, since she is seen as sensitive throughout the rest of the movie,( also, when she took out those bombers, she looked bored like,"" Whatever. I take down bombers down all the time."") 3. Their base is bombed and,(get this), President Snow PUTS A BULLDOZER LOAD OF WHITE ROSES IN THE CRATER OF WHERE A BOMB EXPLODED. Is this supposed to be symbolic, because to me this is kind of stupid. And, how did he know that Katnis would emerge from that one crater? Did he put roses in all the craters? Also, one of my favorite parts is where they say they are ""fully operational"" even though they have a 40 foot crater in their base. I am no structural engineer but I think a 40 foot crater is going to affect your operations in some shape or form. 4. Bunkers have to have bunkers in them. 5. This girl risks her life saving a cat. But, if she loved that cat so much why did she leave it behind in the first place? 6. Apparently this dam, that is probably bigger than the Hoover Dam, is the only, solitary power source for the Capital. And the most effective way to take out this dam is not to bomb it, risking less human lives. No, you send a mob of people with three crates of explosives running at soldiers gunning them down, making it look like something out of World War Z. And, the security at the dam is ridiculous. there are only a few soldiers with guns. No mines, turrets, nothing. And let me say the ""Hanging Man Tree"" song is played during this scene. Let me just say; that song had no reason to be in this movie. The producers only put it in here so they could have there own ""Frozen"". 7. They break in to this building to save Peeta and they knock the guards out with tear gas even though they are wearing helmets. 8. Leaves are bulletproof. 9. The ending is so anticlimactic. So basically, President Snow had an oppurtunity to shoot down the jet with Peeta on board. So I though, ""This might get interested. What if he had a bomb in him, taking Katnis out when he is close enough to her."" But no, they just drug Peeta on meth and it makes Katnis,*tear, sniff*, ""sad"". A final note; I think President Snow likes Katnis. It might be crazy, but just hear this out: 1. He answers her calls, 2. He sends roses, 3. It looks like a love-hate relationship, (explaining why he doesn't just take her out), 4. He is turned on around her. I gave this movie a low rating because people need to wake up; to see that pop culture is misleading and just because of ""PEEEEEEEEEEEETTTTTTTTTTTTTTTAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"" doesn't mean its a good movie. This movie doesn't deserve a 0, but I am compensating for all the biased reviews out there.","FEB 4, 2015",0,Thriller

The film panders to teenagers full of angst. The film hits a few mildly interesting notes on propaganda and power, however these are drowned out by Katniss listening to her hormones rather than her head. This film is not a '10'.

That's pretty much the whole thing. Also, some dudes run up a tree because leaves are, apparently, bulletproof. There's a cat in the movie. People laughed at the cat. People love cats.

Glass,"M Night Shyamalan's trilogy capper is definetely a controversial film. Why? Because of his instinct to be original, and not in subjugating to the audience's expectation. The original 'Unbreakable' actually suffers because of **** was a moderate box office success due to its high budget, and ends up being a cult classic. This one is more of the same variety...going to a certain direction that will baffle audiences, yet is essentially a 'logical' conclusion in light of what is happening in this genre. I will not spoil the controversial 3rd act, but be prepared to be surprised. Whether you like it or not, we need film makers of this ilk.","APR 12, 2019",7,Thriller

Glass,"I've seen both Unbreakable and Split and so I wanted to give this a go. I know M Night Shymalan's films aren't especially liked these days (for the most part) and at first I felt more confused and bewildered than any other emotion. As I say, I've seen the previous films that are referenced in this film but I certainly hadn't watched them esp. recently and so I couldn't remember perhaps the level of detail about characters and events that would have likely helped explain what was going on. It all seemed a bit too 'all over the place'-ish but I admit that by the end, I found myself more hooked than I'd initially expected. James McAvoy gives a great performance as the clearly troubled DID patient (known by any number of multiple personalities - DID being the more contemporary name for multiple personality disorder. I believe it stands for Dissociative Identity Disroder). Also reprising their roles from previous films are both Samuel L Jackson as the comic book store guy from Unbreakable and Bruce Willis as the train survivor, also from Unbreakable and Anya Taylor-Joy, who was one of the DID patients victims in the film Split named Casey Cooke. I thought the film becoming more absorbing and tense towards the end, though I'm not sure I can entirely explain why. I did think Taylor-Joy gave a convincing performance as Casey. Her fear looked pretty genuine to me - infact i'd say the vulnerability element to this film is done pretty well. Of course the film is called Glass and its no wonder why - glass as in shards or fragments, that make up the DID patient. This is a film that comes across as primarily a quirky comic book style film, for obvious reasons, with perhaps a hint of the supernatural and even the super villain about it (think the opposite to superhero's - there's no Superman here). Its not a film likely to appeal to all but it does end fairly suspensefully and I did think it was pretty absorbing and entertaining by the end, though if I had to decide after the first 20-30 minutes whether to keep watching it, I may have chosen not to bother. I don't think I'd actively recommend this film as such, unless your especially keen on the cast or really want to view this as a conclusion to the story that came from M Night Shymalan's previous films - 'Unbreakable' and 'Split'.","MAR 25, 2022",7,Thriller
Glass,"I don't understand why this movie is not an 8/10 for everyone, it did everything I wanted for it to do, amazingly, and I 100% stand behind that ending.

Glass,"It was a good movie. Not a great movie, definitely not like Unbreakable, but a good movie that follows the premise of the last two films in the series. Seriously, it was good. Most negative reviews just don't get the importance or power of the superhero genre's deconstruction. Superhero origin films can't all be the same formula, with the same tropes. In my opinion, this film is better than most hero and antihero films out there right now, at least it portrays heroes in an almost realistic world (I repeat, almost realistic).","MAR 4, 2019",8,Thriller

Glass,"An Interesting take on the Superhero topic. The movie isn't by any means perfect it still has some flaws like the ending and the character arc from David Dunn. Still the movies raises some interesting Question about Heroism and having Superpowers in an modern and realistic Time like our World. About the ending (no Spoilers)..... yeah i didn't liked it but after all it isn't a Marvel Movie =). So i kind of understand why this Film ended this way. Its an gritty down to Earth superhero movie. Even having superpowers these people are still human beings and things....Just Happen, even when you don't like it it still can happen. As someone who loves Reading Comics i found fast an connection with the Story, its was like a Love Letter to Comics and it influence to the Real world. This is a Film were i Think ""This is what the Superhero genre needed"". I personally find ""Glass"" really Great, and I cannot understand the Mixed Reviews.","MAY 25, 2019",8,Thriller
Glass,"One of the biggest underlying themes in the previous two entries of Shyamalan's surprise trilogy is that the potential for extraordinary powers rests inside all of us and that our minds are the key to unlocking them. This message is brought to the forefront for this closing chapter acting as the heart of the story. The real villain in Glass isn't the beast inside McAvoy or even the returning titular anti-hero. It's the people who try to explain away the incredible in order to keep us locked away in a prison of the mundane. In a time where we have been trained to want/expect big flash and spectacle from our superhero movies, Shyamalan stays true to the world he created some 19 years ago. This is means that even when it looks like things are about to take a turn for the grandiose, Glass sticks to its guns by remaining grounded and small-scale throughout. It's a nice change of pace from the standard blockbuster formula that's become the norm for our superpowered adventures. The performances are incredible. Bruce Willis is genuinely acting again for the first time in years and McAvoy once again stuns with his ability to embody so many different characters in what is essentially one role. There's a scene where he is forced to cycle through all of the different personalities he portrays rapid-fire and it is absolutely incredible. The real star of the show for me though was Samuel Jackson, although I'll admit I'm a little biased as this has easily become my favorite role of his due to how easy Shyamalan made Mr. Glass to empathize with. The ending is the only real downside. It's sad to see these characters suffer such tragic fates. The disappointment is somewhat alleviated though by the third plot twist that allows the film to conclude on a more positive note, but ultimately it's still just bitter-sweet at best. Glass is thrilling in it's smallness. There's a fascinating plot here that's backed by some great subject matter. It's definitely an atypical superhero movie for this day and age, but it's no less exhilarating in its own way than the more traditionally exciting works of Marvel, DC, or any of their imitators. Shyamalan created an original work when he could have just used the modern cinematic universe mold, and it's hard to not respect that.","APR 27, 2019",9,Thriller
Glass,"Watching this work by Master of Suspense M. Night Shyamalan takes your breath away. Our reviewer Alex von Roon grew up with Superhero Comics such as Spiderman (The Spider), Batman, The Phantom etc. and admires M. Night Shyamalan's work including the Amex Commercial. Bruce Willis was already excellent in the ""Sixth Sense"". It is great to see him in ""Glass"" as the rest of this exciting Cast. Samuel L Jackson is a living legend who adds urgency and spice. It is a joy watching Anya Taylor-Joy and we will most likely see more of her. Sarah Paulson creates an interesting character. The film does not fall into any category and keeps you thinking. It is fun to see a cameo by the director and yours truly wonders we missed Stan Lee at some point. There are twists and turns and the premise reminds one a bit of the ""MK Ultra"" and ""Ich der Augenzeuge"" philosophy without giving away too much. What would your ranking of M. Night Shyamalan's films be? Maybe let us know in the comments section? Did you read the infamous book ""The Man Who Heard Voices: Or, How M. Night Shyamalan Risked His Career on a Fairy Tale"" We highly recommend it as background information to understanding this highly influential director.","JAN 4, 2024",7,Thriller

Glass,"Shyamalan's take on the popular superhero franchise truly stands out from the rest, making an overall intriguing and original movie. Despite this, I'm ashamed to admit that I was disappointed on after my first viewing of the film, as I expected so much more from the last movie in the 'Unbreakable' trilogy. The positives of 'Glass' really do shine, however, I found that the movie dragged, and the poor pacing was the movie's largest and most noticeable flaw. James McAvoy returning as Kevin and the other personalities was a real pleasure to see; his performance was fantastic. Although McAvoy stole the spotlight, every character in the movie, even supporting characters, played a significant role and made the film work. Although I would have loved to have seen more from certain characters, their setup during at least the first half an hour of the movie was done perfectly. For me, the movie started to lose momentum around the middle. The pace was much slower and it was hard to understand where the film was actually going. It is until the end where it makes sense and for me, the film's finale saved it from becoming painfully average. Overall, M. Night Shyamalan has made a decent follow up to the previous films. It is certainly not a bad movie; it is a good movie, even though I felt disappointed after my first impressions of 'Glass'. I am satisfied with the way it turned out.","FEB 10, 2019",7,Thriller
Glass,"Glass is directed and written by M. Night Shyamalan, with a simple role as we saw him in Unbreakable and Split. Starring James McAvoy, Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Anya Taylor-Joy and Sarah Paulson. Bruce Willis returns as David Dunn as does Samuel L. Jackson as Elijah Price, known also by his pseudonym Mr. Glass. Joining from Split are James McAvoy, reprising his role as Kevin Wendell Crumb and the multiple identities who reside within, and Anya Taylor-Joy as Casey Cooke, the only captive to survive an encounter with The Beast. Following the conclusion of Split, Glass finds Dunn pursuing Crumb's superhuman figure of The Beast in a series of escalating encounters, while the shadowy presence of Price emerges as an orchestrator who holds secrets critical to both men. Glass was one of my anticipating movies list since I watched Split and surprisingly reveal that it's a sequel to the 2000's Unbreakable, which I liked. So yeah, I was very excited to see these three characters gathering together in one movie.. sadly it's the last movie of that trilogy.. and we will get to that ending in the spoiler review. But for now, let's do the spoiler-free review! Okay, as the title says ""Underrated, but disappointing"" the movie is underrated, but let me say that it's not, because not everyone is gonna like this movie.. yeah, maybe underrated, but still disappointing. The first act of this movie was pretty cool, I loved it, the third act also is pretty, no no.. the final fight, because it was pretty epic I enjoyed it very much.. the conclusion and the ending were a little bit messy, the twist was cool, but the ""character"" wasn't that convincing, and I felt like it's not how this character should've been, because it reminded me with Unbreakable, and how it was rushed, Glass is giving us a little more surprising one, but not well crafted. The second act is my biggest flaw with this movie, it was super slow, and confusing.. like how Glass is getting out of his cage? How is he just getting in any room he wants with no keys? Also it's not what you wanted to see from these characters, especially Anya Taylor-Joy, I loved her in Split, but in this one.. she's just there. I mean Spencer Treat Clark had a better role in this movie. Sarah Paulson is also bad, I didn't like her character which was ""You're not that, you're that!"", even her performance was emotionless and in the second act she was just there to go to a room from a room to say and to give us info we already know or ones that we don't care about! So yeah, the second act was new for this trilogy,but still it lacks a lot! James McAvoy is pretty good in this movie just as he was in Split, once more he's the best thing in the movie but I have a flaw with it, which is a spoiler so, I'm gonna talk about it in the spoiler review... Bruce Willis is very good as well, but I have the same flaw which I found with James McAvoy's character, but even more! Samuel L. Jackson is not there most of the movie, but once he's there, he gave the movie a good spirit!! He has also one of the best scenes in the whole trilogy, as we saw in the trailer, when he was moving with his wheelchair and the beast the killing some people behind him, that was pretty cool! Glass disappointed me, but still it's a fresh movie and I'm gonna give it a positive review, don't get me wrong, but I like Split more, but in the mean while, I liked it a little bit more than Unbreakable. I'm gonna give Glass a B!

Glass,"“This was an origin story the whole time”. Eastrail 177 trilogy, a franchise we didn’t expect to exist or needed, but M. Night Shyamalan surprise us once again with his twist and turns. After the unexpected hit of ‘Split’, people were warming up for Shyamalan’s follow up ‘Glass’, and the return of familiar faces like David Dunn, Kevin and Mr. Glass himself. By continuing with the grounded approach towards superheroes while making the fantasy aspects implanted into reality. And of course the unnatural dialogue, a usual trademark for Shyamalan. While I don’t think ‘Glass’ is as bad as people made it out to be, but not to say it’s perfect or great, just plenty of missed opportunities in an already solid conclusion. M. Night Shyamalan manage to craft a trilogy that took him over a decade to make. If you keep in mind of how popular superheroes are now - this stands out from the rest, as being both compelling and meaningful. While Shyamalan is a 50/50 director, but I can tell there’s passion in everything he makes, even if it doesn’t work out and makes questionable decisions. His ego died along time ago and him going back to smaller budget movies is the right move. There’s plenty of long times, close ups and a clever way of structuring the films pace. We start with Dunn, then we follow Kevin, and finally Elijah. Coincidence? The cinematography is solid with a beautiful mixture of colours and the music perfectly fits with the characters and story. James McAvoy returns as Kevin, the man with crowded personalities with an extra set of new faces. It’s amazing how McAvoy can switch between the different characters and make it look so effortlessly, sometimes in a blink of an eye. A mixture of colorful personalities with comedic moments, but there are personalities that can be vicious and a force to be reckon with. So it comes to no surprise he’s the strongest element of this movie. Now I joked in the past about Bruce Willis cold attitude towards his recent roles. I mean, just watch the ‘RED 2’ interview, it’s hilarious how he doesn't hide it. When Willis cares, he’s great, so it’s incredibly sad seeing him lose any care to not only in his performances, but in film choices. In 'Glass', Willis is stilted, but at the same time grounded in his reactions and facial expressions. There was a point midway through through where the film seemed to forget about Dunn. While not a come back role, but at least I see his interest in the story, character and director. By the way, I’m still a fan of him. Samuel L. Jackson is great as the genius, yet wickedly evil Mr. Glass. Despite his disease (brittle bone disease) keeping him permanent in a wheelchair, but that doesn't stop him. It’s psychological manipulation that gives him power and makes him truly dangerous. There’s a great little moment in a scene (without spoilers) where he watches someone die right in front of him, and he leans forward and watches in amusement. The other supporting cast are pretty good as well. Anya Taylor-Joy is good as always, but unfortunately doesn’t have anything to do here. I’m glad they brought back Spencer Treat Clark, who played David Dunn’s son in ‘Unbreakable’ and now working with his dad to track down and stop criminal activity. He really gives an emotional performance, especially towards the end. Sarah Paulson is fine in the movie, but I don’t like where her character goes in the third act, which goes into my issues. As I said before, it’s a flawed movie. While I thought the second act was still pretty good, but was nowhere near as solid as the first act. I’ve got mixed feelings about the ending, because at first I like how bleak it is, basically saying in real life, the villains win. However, the twist itself gets so bizarre it leaves more holes in the story. Overall rating: A clunky movie that will popularize audiences for along time, but at least didn’t play it safe like most superhero movies. “It’s not so bad being in the light.”","FEB 28, 2019",7,Thriller
Glass,"The third part to this epic tribute to superheroes and comic books. Shyamalan left Marvel and DC and their green screen effects way-way behind.

Glass,"A really nice ending for that trilogy. The acting was amazing. The story was solid, in the sens that it tied everything and it stayed true to a certain level of realism. I think there was a long moment in the middle that was divided of action, and maybe some actions scenes are weaker then some others. It was also a psychology film in many ways. It was disturbing, captivating. The ending was very satisfying. Night Shyamalan controlled it's craft here without going overboard. I give it a 80%.","APR 5, 2019",8,Thriller
Glass,"I am not really sure what it is i don't like about James McAvoy, he's just not a good actor. Whatever he does you are always conscious that he is acting, which makes a movie with him as multiple personalities all the worse. That said, his Professor and hick personalities were excellent, the deeper his voice gets the better actor he is to me. I would love if there were multiple personalities that were just impressions of other actors in the film, James McaVoy doing impressions of Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson in a movie with them would be genius because that would demonstrate how people are impressionable to others, something we can all relate to. A movie with elements we can all relate to is the highest form of art.Multiple personalities in movies always comes across poorly, except for Identity that was done well, and I'm Not Here about Bob Dylan (Cate Blanchett played the best version), but yeah maybe multiple personalities should be played by multiple people. M Night Shyamalan is a brilliant director who is not afraid to take chances. As such, only a fraction of movies are a home run (Babe Ruth was","DEC 31, 2019",7,Thriller
Glass,"The time is 2019, and as an audience member and lover of film and cinema in a contemporary world, one has to understand and come to terms with the fact that superhero films are here, and seem to be here to stay for an unforeseen future. While many claim to be tired and exasperated with the not so recent trend of the superhero genre, it seems that the numbers don’t really reflect the attitudes. While sighs are heard every time a new trailer for a Marvel or DC Universe film is revealed from a majority, the box office for these films just keep getting bigger and bigger with each new character, entry, sequel or prequel. Yet, while Marvel and DC aren’t the only ones pumping out superhero films, and well before the Marvel Cinematic Universe became nomenclature for many, it seems that M. Night Shaymalan was well ahead of the curb when it came to creating his own universe of superheroes and villains, we just were not aware of it at the time. While Split revealed a very exciting fact in the closing credits scene, it seems that the secret is out on Glass, Shaymalan’s newest film. Less of an emotional twist ending and more of a narrative one, Split revealed that the film existed in the same universe as Shaymalan’s highly applauded and loved origin superhero film Unbreakable. Yet, while many believed that Shaymalan’s golden days were behind him as a director, Split seemed to have revived the once untouchable then plagued director back into the spotlight. After the massive success of Split and the idea to connect his two creations into one universe and have them collide in Glass, was a risk the studio was willing to make, especially given the director’s modest budgeting range. While Unbreakable was made on an unusually large $75 million dollar budget back in 2000 (which was unheard of then, but thanks to the immense success of The Sixth Sense, studios were hopeful), the film only brought in only $250 million worldwide, which only paled in comparison to the director’s hit The Sixth Sense, a film that brought in almost $700 million on a miniature $40 million budget. Yet, after a string of massive critical failures, including Lady In The Water, The Happening, The Last Airbender and After Earth, with only one of those films being a box office slump in Lady In The Water, Shaymalan went from critical darling and wonder-kid, to a running gag within the film industry. Yet, after almost a decade of making terrible films, Shaymalan resilience brought him a return to form, thanks to his comeback film and going back to his horror roots with the low-budget indie film The Visit, thus resurrecting the once ostracized filmmaker. With new life and his origin intentions of creating a trilogy based superhero universe well before Marvel and Kevin Feige was even in the picture, Shaymalan began extending his superhero world with Split, unknown to audiences at the time. With a budget of only $9 million dollars, Shaymalan focused less on spectacle and created a superhero universe grounded in character study and depth; focusing more on ‘what’ makes a superhero/villain as opposed to the challenges they face once they are fully evolved. For Glass, another modest budget of $20 million shows just how little faith the Hollywood studios have in the once dominating director, especially when that amount of money barely pays for a headlining actor or a marketing budget. Yet, nineteen years later, here we are with Glass, the finale of what’s being called the East Rail 177 trilogy. Dissecting Glass for too long, one may very well make the whole film shatter; but as fragile and tempered the film really is, the ambition behind an almost two decade long dream, is quite remarkable, especially during a time where superhero films are pumped out faster than human life is. One of the many satisfying factors of Glass is Shaymalan’s ability to round-up characters from the first two films, and each character never skipping a beat in Glass; the performances are easily the best parts of the film. Picking up right where Split left off, David Dunn (Bruce Willis) and his sidekick son and tech savvy partner, providing Dunn with his eyes and ears, Joseph Dunn (Spencer Treat Clark, the original son in Unbreakable which was great to see) use the internet, social media and surveillance technology as tools towards capturing the troubled Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy). After successfully tracking down Crumb before he takes the lives of another innocent group of teenage girls, Dunn and Crumb engage in a very muted and underwhelming face-off, until they are both captured by the authorities, accompanied by “comic-book therapist” Dr. Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson). Brought to a psychiatric ward where Dr.Staple is keen on giving realization that both men are in fact not superhuman, they both soon realize that Elijah Price aka Mister Glass (Samuel L. Jackson) is in the same hospital following his terrifying acts in Unbreakable.","FEB 11, 2019",5,Thriller
Glass,"Ohhhh dear... I waited 18 years for this... Left the theater feeling like I was going to cry. 18 years to see David Dunn again as his amazing superhero self. Waited and waited! Could never understand what was taking so long. Then, nearly jumped out of my seat at the end of Split when, there he was, so nonchalantly sitting in a diner. Finally, my favourite hero was back. At the beginning of Glass, I was thrilled to see a cast of familiar faces. First 20 minutes seemed ok... bit odd that David's big comeback consisted of him beating the crap out of two delinquent youth, but hey, he was back. The scene in the factory was great, but it all happened along a super hyper timeline. From then on the disappointment in my heart grew. I walked out believing that Shyamalan must have just wanted the whole trilogy to be over, like he'd been pressured into doing Glass, and his heart really wasn't into it. So much potential... came off seeming... tired- just like David Dunn. All that aside James Macavoy rocked his 'characters'. Sam-U-L was great, but poor Bruce ... he simply wasn't given enough time in the light... And that, my friends is a travesty.","JAN 27, 2019",4,Thriller
Glass,"The conclusion of a universe ""unpublished"" of cinemas is not a disaster, but it cannot be good. The end of a trilogy that originates from the classic ""Unbreakable"", makes us anxious in ""Split"", falls into ""Glass "". With a naïve script, the film tries to emscore new connections only in its conclusion, to try to revive the public, after hours whose no surprising event occurs to revive its script. The interpretation of the characters, although they fall from income, remain well synchronized.

Glass,"Disappointing finale to an underrated series. Plot travels nowhere, deflating ending, pointless lacklustre film. MNight does a fine job directing, but not enough to save film","JUN 1, 2019",5,Thriller
Glass,"Where to start. Well. Let me begin by saying I enjoyed ""Split"". James McAvoy has a excellent performance in that and he again steals the show in this film even among top tier talent. I have never seen ""Unbreakable"" and after seeing this film, I don't have much motivation to see it now. The ending and third act of this film greatly affect that. The film does indeed start with promise. We get reintroduced to Bruce Willis's character from ""Unbreakable"", in my case, a new introduction. I liked this but there was still a lot of mystery to his vigilante acts and it ties nicely into his hunt for McAvoy's beast. We get some moments of humor in there to which again is a fine touch from M. Night's films. There is not many M. Night films that I have been a big fan of. ""Lady in the Water"" was a complete dud as was ""The Village"". Then there is ""Signs"" which is just OK. I am more partial to his TV work with ""Wayward Pines"" but even that when way off the deep end in season 2 and lost me greatly. Seems like it did with a lot of people as the show was then canceled. The first 30 minutes or so of this film is entertaining and interesting with Willis hunting down McAvoy leading to them being captured by Dr. Ellie Staple, played by the always great Sarah Paulson. She is another one that steals this movie. This film is very much the McAvoy and Paulson show. I thought the capture sequence was a bit odd and didn't quite feel right but I won't complain about this. The sequences in the intution are well acted and really bring the performances for the entire cast. Anya Taylor-Joy was a welcome return from ""Split"" and I thought here scenes with McAvoy were heartwarming and touching. If there is one thing that I can take away from this film, it's their scenes. I really enjoyed them and really felt their moments until the end. Here is where I have some issues. Number 1, Sam Jackson is very underused in this film. I have to question why this film is named after him. He doesn't have much to do nor does he have a great deal of screen time. I understand that the motivation in the end is his but this film does not deserve the title. This is still very much McAvoy's film and The Horde is the driving force of this film. More of a ""Split"" sequel I'd say. Bruce Willis is just alright here as well. I expected so much more considering the screen time he gets in the beginning but he sort of just fades into the black as the film goes on and his end is very disappointing. But then again, so is the while final act. Without going into too much spoiler territory, I can just say that the final act makes ""Unbreakable"" and ""Split"" almost feel redundant. Poor story choices and big picture explanations are just confusing and I felt myself shaking my head through the last 10 minutes. This as a whole hurts the film entirely. I wanted to like it, I really did. I just left the theater feeling disappointed and asking why did M. Night make these story decisions. Grade: C-","APR 18, 2019",6,Thriller
Glass,"M. Night Shyamalan hovering between hero and villain in the final chapter of his mini-universe of extraordinary beings. Let me be clear: Shyamalan's one of my favorite directors working right now and I will fight tooth and nail to stand up for him. My duty as a reviewer, however, must always overcome any subjective approach, any dishonest desire. But, why do I say all this? While it's true that the last act of this third installment is insanely brilliant, off-kilter, twisted, as everything surrounding the filmmaker, and cinematically fabulous, act one and two are practically a mess, a deadening pileup of weird decisions that instead of infusing new perspectives into the nowadays suffocating superhero genre, indirectly undermines the exciting plot threads and the style/artistic exercises of the two previous prequels. We're talking about Shyamalan, a name attached to both bewilderment and surprise; for better or worse, ""Glass,"" a film I followed carefully throughout the production, is not the first disappointment of the year, but it does be the most bittersweet yet entertaining ride a movie buff will have in the first two months of this new year. There are serious issues all around the first and second act, among them the tragic absence of something the director has stood out for from the beginning. In the first acts of his best pics, the story drags a sense of restlessness, an enervating discomfort that illuminates the way for the big finale. In the second acts, tension and uncertainty reach unimaginable heights, forcing audiences to keep their breath all along the controversial climax. It's inconceivable then that the first half of ""Glass"" is a havoc of flat scenes, lacking charm and tact, soul and suspense, in very large part by defective editing. It must be said that young Charles Xavier hands down saves the entire second act to be an outright disaster. The intervention I refer to takes place halfway the feature film between Kevin Wendell Crumb and Dr. Ellie Staple in the one-color psychiatric ward, and is a masterfully performed, planned and filmed, is terrifying, ironic and impressive in unison. James McAvoy steals the entire movie and takes, again, all the interpretative praises. Patricia, Dennis, Hedwig and some of the other cool personalities are back, who, thanks to the laborious performance of the ""Atonement"" actor, are fully credible, plausible despite his imposing physical. The actor jumping from one character to another knocks us all out, we're in front of a different person in every change. ""Split"" is still the one that treasures his tour-de-force, but McAvoy is phenomenal here leading it with a performance worthy of cult status. I guarantee you, you're not ready for the grand finale. Talking about plot twists and the last thirty minutes, personally, is pretty much the same thing. It's fascinating how it realistically blends comic book structures into storytelling, moving along within the canons of the all-time comic book proceedings. But this is Shyamalan, so you better look closer. The long-awaited showdown and its corresponding adjunct are as good as they can possibly be, bathed with powerful realism and pessimism that some fans — because this is a movie for fans — will have to think twice to swallow what just happened on screen. Likewise, its low key set-pieces, the trio of performances and the stealthy but aggressive writing moves make up a glorious, intelligent and above all human ending. ""Glass"" by M. Night Shyamalan is by no means one of the filmmaker's top works. You have to see at least ""Unbreakable"" — which it's most related to — to understand everything this last installment, which should serve as an integral, standalone film such as ""Split"", tries to unpack. The film has no identity because of the strange ingredients it mixes up to prove it's unlike the other superhero flicks out there; it's neither a thriller, a fantasy/drama nor a suspense pic, it's all of them at once, a terrible phenomenon coming from a lazy, flat and cinematic energy-free first act. Aesthetically, it doesn't stand out; yes, it's not a big-budget production, but Chris Trujillo's production design and Mike Gioulakis' peculiar cinematography doesn't fit in with each other or the most groundbreaking genre incursions. On the upside, the movie's saved by James McAvoy, who's superb as Kevin and all his personalities once again, a slightly exciting score by West Dylan Thordson — who blatantly borrows ""Split"" compositions, — a commendable, delicate resolution by Shyamalan and a third act so well executed that it'll surely leave you speechless, something that, in one way or another, the filmmaker keeps doing masterfully.","MAR 27, 2019",5,Thriller
Glass,"I think this movie would be impossible to enjoy without seeing both Unbreakable and Split, even taking that into account I think this movie was the weakest of the three and suffers greatly for needing to take so much time building the bridge to the first two without retelling the story and not spending enough time creating it's own story. So what you are left with has very little weight to it and comes off as a goofy sub-superhero movie with no flash of a big blockbuster and no story that you would hope for. McAvoy does all the heavy lifting, Jackson was good, Willis wasn't given much to do. The ending was jarring and unsatisfying.","FEB 24, 2019",6,Thriller
Glass,"I am extremely happy that the Eastrail trilogy exists, but I extremely sad about how it chose to go off. I will recommend it, but man, I feel so mixed about it. . . Good : Shyamalan gives us a potentially great movie with some unforgivable flaws. The setting and the concept looks really incredible. Bruce Willis looked really good after a very long time. He cared for his role and was great as David Dunn. Naturally, James McAvoy gives an incredible performance as Kevin and the other personalities. Samuel Jackson kills it as Mr. Glass yet again. He is not in a role that we usually see him in, and he hasn't lost the touch in perhaps the most ""against type"" role he has ever done. The first act and how all the three lead characters are brought together is quite good. There are emotional scenes and deaths. All of them hit the perfect note for me. I was almost crying in those scenes. There were some characters I never wanted to see dying, but they do. I would've never minded if they were unrealistically resurrected, but they aren't. It's not a spoiler at all. It made me realize how well Shyamalan wrote and directed those characters and how amazing the respective performances were, and how much I liked each of them. Also, I loved how Shyamalan used some of the deleted scenes from Unbreakable in this movie. . . Mixed : We got to see a lot of Kevin's identities than in Split, but I think the less was more in this case. McAvoy did a great job, but many parts felt as a forced spot for some random character to pop out. Anya Taylor-Joy gives a great performance, but we don't buy what she does due to a poorer writing and underdeveloped emotional weights. She does her job very well to elevate the material, and I loved what she did. But in the end, it wasn't so believable. Honestly, I don't think she was needed in the film. And finally I admire Shyamalan's guts to send off the main characters in the way he did. But, the way they went off didn't do a proper justice to them. The same thing could've been done in a much better way. . . Bad : The most frustrating part would be the arc given to David Dunn. It was the most poorly done part of the movie. In particular, the way they sent him off was the most frustrating part of the movie. I can accept the way how the others were sent off, but not him. He deserved a lot better than this. It felt as if Shyamalan wanted to do it properly, but couldn't because of the budget or studio interference. And the last two twists. The first one was something I have seen in some horror films, and I have started to feel that such an interpretation is the most blant thing to do. The second twist involves Mr. Glass. The twist gives a feel good moment, but since it involves Mr. Glass, the f**king terrorist who killed a lot of people, it didn't feel right in the direction they went. Lastly, there are some plot hole type of stuff there. The way they decided to control Kevin's personalities could've been avoided if he would cover his eyes. The way they use water as a ""kryptonite"" for Dunn was stupid and totally different from the one done in Unbreakable. Mr. Glass' plan seem to work perfectly, but it feels as if he knew how every single thing would turn out in the end, which is impossible. Also, there are some comic book panels which show the exact stuff that happen in Split, and makes a little to no sense. There are shots which tend to establish a link between Casey and Dunn, but I don't know how that worked. . . Conclusion : Only I know how much I wanted to give it an absolute 10/10 and an A+. Sadly, I cannot do it. I read somewhere that it was supposed to be a 3.5 hour long movie. I am really eager to watch the Director's cut. It doesn't feel like the exact movie Shyamalan planned to do. It feels like a really great movie trimmed down. Not choppy editing. I feel as if the ideas that were in this movie were not completely explored. As a Shyamalan movie, it is in my top 5. It's way better than some s**t he gave us, earlier this decade. But still, Sixth Sense and Unbreakable remain the ultimate greats he has given. . . Rating. . . Score : 6.7/10 Grade : B+ . (Only I know how bad I am feeling to assign these ratings to this movie)","AUG 13, 2019",6,Thriller
Glass,"Before Split we didn't need a sequel for Unbreakable. I'm telling the truth and considering that it was the last great Shyamalan film, it was evident that it could end up damaging his legacy. Split wasn't really bad, at all, although it was hardly a memorable film and set a good base for a very interesting confrontation in the closing chapter and with Glass, Shyamalan could have done something impressive but he couldn't. It seems he was afraid of his own ambition. He tried to overanalyze something that it shouldn't and he also locks up his characters when he should have freed them and unfortunately constructs a conclusion as laughable as uninspired. Bonus points for its three main actors. McAvoy incredible, he effortlessly steals the scenes to Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis. Glass is unfortunately one of those cases in which the expectations end up killing the product delivered and it's a pity because I really wanted this to be a great film","FEB 17, 2019",5,Thriller
Glass,"...The big fat problem with Glass is the writing. You see, it is stuffed with hackneyed garbage. The dialogue especially is a chorus of comic book hokum about heroes, villains, delusions of grandeur, and master plans. It comes from just about every character, but worst of all is The Horde, played terribly by James McAvoy.","JUN 14, 2020",4,Thriller
Glass,This film feels like a real fringe project from Shyamalan cashing in on Willis' cameo at the end of split with a full on ensemble 'comic book' movie. The concept here is fascinating and if you can switch your brain to 'full cheese' mode then you will definitely get more from watching this. I got 'feels' in the showdown but really it was a huge tease to get to that point. Samuel L felt criminally underused here and you have to wait some 20-30 mins just to see his face :( Again the screenplay and direction are not the strength but the production is solid although I get the feeling most of it was spent just to get Jackson and Willis onto the project. More entertaining than I thought it would be!,"MAR 20, 2020",6,Thriller
Glass,"Not a bad movie... but not a good movie either. I think the better word that defines this movie is DISAPPOINTING. M. Night Shyamalan ruins his own universe/world with this one. Shots are well achieved, clean and pure, colours are also very well used. OST non-existent. Nothing happens in all the movie (although that's not bad), it's really slow, it cooks slowly and it's the best part (unless we are thinking that), but suddenly everything goes to hell in the final act when it started to go up level, A PIECE OF **** suddenly a sect appears that wants to destroy superhumans, it doesn't matter if you're good or bad (every good part is in the **** trailers and clips). The only thing that raises the film is James McAvoy's performance. Don't go to watch this, don't waste your money and time. In the end i wanted to end this torture, there were people who were yawning. P.S.: In the last 3 mins. Shyamalan tries to fix it with one of his famous plot twist but it was too late already.","APR 12, 2019",5,Thriller
Glass,"Some really great acting by McAvoy, Jackson and Willis, but the doctor pretty much ruined all chances of this being a great movie and that's a darn shame. It could have been a much better movie with a more believable Elie Staple. She comes across as being somehow off in her role. Her performance just isn't on par with that of the other actors. I didn't see Split (yet), but as a standalone movie the story seems somewhat strange. Maybe as a series it makes more sense, but for me it was rather unsatisfying. Giving it a 6 for McAvoy's performance which is simply outstanding.","APR 13, 2019",6,Thriller

Glass,"Many audiences believe that the film did not meet their expectations due to its ""disappointing"" ending, and many of them are idiots who do not understand the theme of M. Night Shyamalan's trilogy. It is suppose to give superheroes a more realistic perspective if they were ever a possible existence in our world. Glass provided us with an anticlimatic ending because it stayed true to its theme. Audiences were expecting a linear story where a final showdown in some sort of grand stadium occurs with the hero winning and going home. This would probably be what would've happened if this was any other superhero movie like X-men. However, realistically, the super-humans probably would've just fought in a more common area in the society they lived in, and they probably would've been condemned quickly by authorities. There are many subtle messages and hidden clues laid out all over the film. If move critics watched the movie a couple more times they would likely see it in a different light, but they usually only care about racing to be the first people writing a review on the movie. They are making the same mistake they did 19 years ago when Unbreakable first came out...","FEB 1, 2019",6,Thriller

Glass,"Glass had allot of hype surrounding it especially for me. Unbreakable is one of my favourite movies and I thought split was not Emnites return to form but pretty good. The twist was okay, but I thought that glass kinda stunk because its so convoluted with crap that it made the movie to confusing and the ending ****. People would not think that it would just be cool and superheroes are real, they would question it. Emnite had pure talent bu now it's gone.","MAY 26, 2019",4,Thriller
Glass,"I'll give it a passing grade because it kept me intrigued almost up to the end, even though the final disappointment dragged it down to a 4/10 for me, honestly. The action was lackluster even compared to Unbreakable, every fight scene looked like the characters were convinced in their own heads they could make it impressive yet just couldn't translate that thought into action no matter how hard they tried. Beyond that, almost all ""meta human"" material revolved around James McAvoy's ability to change personalities at the flip of a switch, something that got old very quickly. The ""payoff"" was not all that original, and so unimpressively presented that I think I might've been less disappointed if they had finished it on that other possible conclusion they kept hinting at in the first half (still would've been a disappointment but maybe a bit more tolerable). If you liked Unbreakable, don't worry about Glass, you can skip it and you'll be fine. It doesn't add anything to it, possibly quite the contrary. If you haven't seen any of the 3 movies, just watch Unbreakable, and if you're bored one day give Split a shot, it's not that bad and doesn't intersect with Unbreakable much at all. But skip Glass, it's not a movie anyone needed. Much less any continuation they left it open to.","FEB 13, 2019",5,Thriller

Glass,"GLASS #9 I wasn’t particularly thrilled by M. Night Shyamalan’s split personality film before this one called, indeed, Split. But here is its sequel Glass, which finds the 3 ‘bad guys’ of the core of these films, Unbreakable, Night’s best film to date, in a Psyche facility as prisoners. There is The Beast, the split personality character from Split who calls himself the Horde. Glass himself a mostly comatose character throughout the film who is the mastermind behind the train wreck in Unbreakable and of course Bruce Willis reprising his Unbreakable self from the same named film. All three share a wing at this insane asylum but I was glad that the film had some action before the shrinks got ahold of the story. Nothing scintillating but at least there’s something to go on. After the opening the three have long and useless chats with the resident psychoanalyst, Dr. Ellie Staple. Most of the supposed ‘events’ in the film concern The Beast where actor, James McAvoy can try on a few lisps and mannerisms, that do feel contrived and mostly Hollywood in tone and circumference. The movie really is missing action as the main story is if these three are ‘Special’ with a capital S, are they Superheroes, like Superman or as the analyst demands, are they ordinary men with delusions. Not a bad supposition but here in Glass there is in the end a somewhat secret society that thinks these ‘insane’ should be suppressed. One does wonder what for, as these ‘freaks’ really aren’t likely to get any traction in larger society. 5.5 Out Of 10 Glass reaches it’s harebrained conclusion but takes some time in getting there, by then there doesn’t seem to be all that much going on. The ‘nuts’ are all dead, and the ‘clowns’ the general public are all put back to sleep. The last scenes of this are oddly ineffective but Shyamalan’s dreadful fear of anything happening at all dangerous etc., is thankfully for him, put down. #CLAYSMOVIEREVIEWS #movie #movies #film #films #cinema #instamovie #instamovies #moviefan #moviereview #review #critic #filmcritic #critical #moviecritic #rated #cinema #reviews #moviereviews #GLASS #MNIGHTSHYAMALAN","JAN 26, 2019",5,Thriller

Glass,"Let’s reflect on comic book history, and also compare it to why M. Night Shyamalan’s cap to the Unbreakable trilogy continues his negative artistic streak. In 1897, The Yellow Kid in McFadden’s Flats became the first comic, something perfectly straightforward in its simplicity, unlike Glass, which relies on superfluous flashbacks instead of conflict between the three patients who lead the story. The film also diminishes anyone with Brown skin to the background in ever-so-subtle hints of unintentional racism, which feels too much like 1937, when comics evolved into monthly “funnies.” What Shyamalan comments on about the history of superheroes forgets to put Superman’s influence on the subtext, or any true knowledge about the platinum age of comic books. Not just that, he doesn’t even bother to speak up on the reality of superheroes leading psychiatric patients into a dictatorship. The disloyalty goes on to the comics’ golden age as well, that time when Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain Marvel, Flash, Green Lantern, and others came around. Each of these heroes are still instantly recognizable now because they’re all more sympathetic than the returning Samuel L. Jackson role, Elijah. Here is shown a flashback of his mom watching him get hurt on a carnival ride as a child, yet any internal pain of his remains intangible. Even if he along with the two other freaks are believed to be superheroes, actual comic books have better-analyzed heroic theories. At this rate, I’d rather see Samuel L. Jackson hop off the wheelchair to start preaching Ezekiel 25:17 again, and not have to keep wearing that obvious wig for a now-dated story arc. Onto the silver age, comic books began to be seen as corruptive to the youth, thus the Comics Code Authority began, which caused an eventual bright, campy tone to take over; think Adam West’s Batman as a strong example. Shyamalan actually handles that well without feeling out of place alongside the established golden age grit. Remember how Batman & Robin was almost all Dutch angles? A similar style is used here to suggest how Elijah reads his interactions, or how a hysterical perspective of “the Beast’s” victims is seen upside down when he crawls on the ceiling. To switch back on cheesiness without the unintentional (or failed) humor, dangerously deep focus on closeup shots block out distractions, working off a pink hallway designed by Chris Trujillo (Stranger Things) to mimic a supervillain’s lair. It’s like every frame here is a legit comic book panel! It compensates for the way Sarah Paulson (12 Years a Slave, Carol) keeps an insincere face throughout her entire performance, even more so for Anya Taylor-Joy’s (Thoroughbreds, The Witch) absent sense of rhythm in her expressionless eyes that look like Natalie Portman sobbing, “Anakin, you’re breaking my heart.” Yet the almost completely untalented cast ironically works to the advantage of James McAvoy when his killer portrayal **** barriers immediately upon introduction. An odd sense of fulfillment breaks through as the three leads fit nowhere, much like how the bronze age lead to comics taking on a realistic tone. Plenty of disturbing images shed mortality to familiar comic book images, particularly a line of high school cheerleaders chained up, all of which are enhanced by the musical score’s stressed strings—a ticking bomb that signals time to break for impact. Then finally comes the dark age of comics, when antiheroes, particularly Watchmen and Deadpool, got their origins. Shyamalan’s three antiheroes could make a valid case for criminal actions… if consistency exists anywhere. Probably the most noticeable logical inconsistency is how bright lights change James’ character personalities, but it really gets out of hand throughout the ridiculous third act. It attempts to comment on the climaxes of other comic book movies, except this happens after the entire feature proves unable to decide which scenes are fiction or fact. Thus, the audience appeal winds up weak, mainly to the fault of M. Night Shyamalan’s screenplay preaching the old comic book idea that love heals (ugh). He cannot authenticate the full potential of such a gross idea in any way, and even takes the wrong turns to explore it; one of those approaches includes a legitimate case of Stockholm syndrome! So today, with all our comics becoming strong cinematic/television properties, it tells our minds to honor having super abilities greater than our own God-given abilities. It tells us that anyone considered a freak is a psycho with a mind set to rule the world. Shyamalan’s commentary is dead-wrong.","JAN 30, 2019",4,Thriller

Glass,"I saw Split last year without any background information, not having seen even a trailer, possibly, with Friend at the Capitol Drive-In. I’m someone who’s had a love-hate relationship with Shyamalan, like I think a lot of people. My older brother told me a story of going to an advanced screening of some festival movie and sitting through the trailers of a kind of cool horror film about the devil on an elevator or something, and the moment that Shyamalan’s name popped onto the screen, everyone in the theater started laughing and booing. I was 10 years old when Unbreakable came out. That was one year after The Sixth Sense. Shyamalan made The Village when I was 14, and I still hold a warm place in my heart for that movie, ditto Lady in the Water, which I appreciated as the offbeat comedy it appeared he intended to make. I know a lot of people made fun of Avatar: The Last Airbender, but I was just so psyched to see that movie on screen that I let a lot of things slide. Hell, I even saw The Visit, which, like did anyone else see that dumpster fire? I walked out of that movie having sweat through my whole shirt, because I’ll be damned if it didn’t set me on edge. Even so, when the end scene of Split tipped its hand as a sequel, I couldn’t contain a surly **** off, Shyamalan” or the automatic gag reflex that followed. He had taken a perfectly good, standalone film staring one of my favorite young actors of the decade, Anya Taylor-Joy, and succeeded in making me sympathize with a truly creepy villain. Why **** that up with a trilogy twenty years in the making that no one asked for? I’m not doing anything brave by sniping a month late at the final installment of a substandard trilogy by Shyamalan, but there was just so much potential here for the guy to actually comment on the state of comic book films after twenty years of reflection and the street cred to make a statement, á la Birdman or the Incredibles. Split had bought him time and goodwill to tell a challenging story, but instead we have a series of disappointingly bland close-up fights, a lot of awkward running on all fours by McAvoy, a lot of navel gazing, and cloying self-referentialism (including a too long explanation of the director’s second cameo). Bruce Willis looks like he couldn’t be bothered to show a range of emotion beyond tired and bored. The premise for their treatment facility is pretty bonkers, as is the reason cited for allowing a teenage girl into the same room as her murderous abductor. The false bottom endings don’t feel clever. They feel cheap, like someone’s trying to get away with a windowless bedroom by putting hotel art on the wall.

Glass,"Glass serves serves as yet another classic M. Night Shyamalan misstep in his inconsistent career. Unbreakable is one of my favorite movies ever made and to see the utter disservice that Glass gives to its story and characters is unforgivable. No spoilers are present in this review but if you're an Unbreakable fan I strongly advise giving Glass a miss. While Glass has a relatively strong start, giving nice fan service in the opening battle; it is over far too soon and the movie quickly dissolves into a boring, convoluted therapy session with little engagement from the main protagonists we've come to love. The movie had so much potential with the strong leads of the previous two films in the franchise, Unbreakable and Split. Glass instead completely underutilizes the talents of Bruce Willis as David Dunn and Sam Jackson as Mr. Glass for the entire first half of the film, instead focusing on some convoluted, boring narrative driven by supporting actors to set up the lore destroying final act. When ALL we want to see is Mr. Glass, David Dunn and The Beast embroiled in some dramatic caper which will lead to some dramatic, conclusive twist ending to *SATISFYINGLY* end the story arcs of these main three characters. Instead, the movie Glass delivers the exact opposite. Glass completely and utterly KILLS the hype built from the final scene of the movie Split where Dunn is seen in the diner and the incredible Unbreakable score starts thumping to life (a score which is barely even muttered in Glass). I could have honestly written a better script myself. Whilst McAvoy gives a strong performance it has nothing to bounce off of due to the total watering down of David Dunn's character (mind the pun). Most disappointing movie of the year.","APR 27, 2020",1,Thriller
Glass,"Split Into Disappointments. Glass Shyamalan's conclusion to his beloved project is a disappointing loose thread that thoroughly convinces you to hold on to it, but barely is ready to be the host for it. There is too much going behind the screen- his signature move- that when it is reveal it does leave you in an awe of it, but when it comes to show definite figures on screen, the numbers are often mismatching. There is no romance in either the characters or the storytelling. And it is the primary reason why it **** so vigorously. Without any whatsoever flow, the storytelling often comes off as news, which too frankly isn't intriguing. To be informative is one thing and to be a narrator another. What it does get right, is the mythology that Shyamalan has constructed in his mind. His sincere respect to the concept itself can easily be filtered out in his mannerism. His film lives on glorifying these characters to their limits. He gives them enough range and room to flaunt in their persona and the impact it creates to the surrounding of it. And clearly he has kept McAvoy at the front of it, the time, space, energy and range he has offered to that character, is all admirable accepted by McAvoy, and the result is stupendous. His awe-inspiring performance both challenges and mocks his fellow actors, his commitment on the nakedness and innocence of each personality is the soul reason, he emerges as the only survivor from this tale. Challenging him with few good scenes, resides Jackson's thirst for the quest and abomination. With very little to do, he makes sure he leaves a last longing impression on the viewers. Paulson has a bit edgy character to portray, either way, she never is able to enchant us nor overpower us through her schemes. Willis, as probably the biggest disappointment, is playing a cameo, with very little finesse on his performance. The other supporting cast like Johnson and Treat Clark too falls under the same pit. Shyamalan has always managed to build up the hype like no one else, he aces in it, but when it comes to reveal the cards, they are often disappointing or rushed over. In this case, the physical sequences are not only dull and off putting but annoying, which is mostly mutilated by the eerie camera work that is there to actually enhance the momentum of the scene; irony. Aforementioned, his last thought on this big war of comic books, is sharp and illuminating, it shifts our perspective to a whole new dimension. But before any of it scrolls open, it is already too late. While its first act maps out the characters in a different state, the second one that ought to be husky and cunning; especially since Jackson is in control of the ride, it isn't thoroughly justified with very little skin in the whole ""mastermind"" game. Glass aches you more than you would anticipate, the beloved characters over the years, they deserved much more and so did we.","JAN 17, 2019",3,Thriller
Glass,"Third act is horrendous, nothing original or clever about it. They could of cut out about an hour of Sarah Coulson monologuing and perhaps it wouldn't of been as boring. If you're a fan of the the other two I'd say avoid it. Left a bad taste in my mouth.","JAN 21, 2019",3,Thriller
Glass,"A promising first hour gradually devolves into a preposterous mishmash of pretentious nonsense. Unbreakable remains one of Night's best films, and Split was a welcome return to form, but the dude just can't help himself. Given a slightly bigger budget, and a few inches too much creative oversight, he loses his goddamned mind. There's a relatively great 90-minute movie here that gets suffocated by **** ""comic book"" metacommentary (would not be surprised in the least to find out that Night has never read a comic book in his life), and a completely nonsensical ""twist"" -- his worst yet, for anyone still counting -- that leads into a final few minutes that make no sense whatsoever. I loved Glass at first and absolutely hated it by the time the credits rolled. Please restrict this particular filmmaker to $5M budgets. His ego simply can't handle anything more than that.","APR 1, 2021",3,Thriller
Glass,"Glass is interesting at times, no doubt, but it's one of those sequels that takes away a little something from its predecessors just simply by existing. Glass's biggest problem is that the script never gives a clear reason to care about any of its three protagonists, instead promoting their lock-up as ultimately justifiable when all is said and done. The entirety of the second act is even a first-class trip straight into boredom. Any and all attempts at humor, which usually come from one of McAvoy's many personalities, in particular, Hedwig, come off flat and usually are more striking as random than humorous. Lastly, if you still can't muster skipping this one, prepare for Shyamalan's signature unnatural-feeling character interactions, directing, and acting from those supporting the main players of the cast.","JAN 17, 2019",2,Thriller

Glass,"ATROCIOUS ENDING I'm not one of those people who kneel before Unbreakable. I found it deeply boring. Split was ok, except for some character's huge stupidity. The begining of Glass was ok, but the ending is soooo anti-climactic. If you think about the whole trilogy, what was the point? Have people believe in themselves? Yeah, we surely needed 3 films for that. Not much character development, by the way. I didn't like the plot of Glass. The psychiatric ward, with having the audience guessing ""was it all in their head despite seeing them do superhuman stuff?"". I didn't buy it at all. Though, I like the fact that they tried to do something different, rather than a classic superhero movie. But I would've liked something inbetween. My review is messy. So is the movie. I understand why people liked it, despite its dumpster fire ending.","APR 1, 2019",2,Thriller

I was intrigued to find out how were these 3 characters trying to co-live in the dullest sanatorium ive seen in movies ever... but i think i didnt miss anything during the 2h of the film because they dont even interact with each other in any way until the very end. Weird camera angles not suitable for the scenes or emotions they ""tried"" to achieve. Bruce Willis was kinda sleep most of the part of the film just as Samuel Jackson.","APR 7, 2019",2,Thriller
Glass,"So you saw Unbreakable, you enjoy Split and you are ready for Glass!! But after 20 minutes of watching suddenly you notice something odd, oh yes is the poor will of Bruce Willis in his acting where he can be replaced easily for a obscure silhouette with his voice or a random double with a green poncho. Is sad that one of the most iconic character bring down the whole movie, where you can find a decent plot carried by the marvelous performance of McAvoy and the always reliable Samuel L.J. From the side of the plot is good see this three character collide (more of ten if you count the multiple one of McAvoy) and continue with the developed under the influence of each other. From the technical aspect is nothing from another world, if you pay enough attention you will encounter some mistakes in the continuity but still for sometimes seems a movie filmed for a project and not a jewel of hollywood so dont expect to much, as I say McAvoy and Jackson carried the movie in their shoulders.","JAN 23, 2019",3,Thriller
Glass,"Here is the sort of conclusion, at least we hope, of the trilogy of pseudo-superheroes with depressive tendencies, in this case the junk psycho-neuropaths without the usual capes and super-tights… as in the two previous ones films by Shyamalan who definitely signs with dismaying consistency several rubbishes in a row: a combo of rubbish! Shyamalan is therefore the superhero of serial crap! As usual, the actors cavort and/or strike poses (and pauses) in this sleep-inducing film from start to finish: everything is indeed pathetically slow and particularly distressing. The kind of scenario is a powerful narcoleptic and the staging is worthy of a hebephrenic suffering from the last degree of daze. He would need 10 good electro-shock sessions in a row to wake him up! There's nothing going on and the dialogues are extremely stupid and surprisingly pretentious, unless it's a mixture of half-dollar counter psychology with the pretentiousness of a comb. ass that farts higher than his ass. And as already mentioned, everyone is so bad in it that it feels like a third-rate TV movie!

You also magically minimized the talent of one of our generation's greatest, Sarah Paulson, by directing her into making a resting **** face with a holier-than-thou attitude for the whole film. The whole Film! After she blew our minds in the few minutes she was in Birdbox, you took such a great talent, and your direction to her was ""make this one facial expression, and do not emote for the rest of the movie"". AND, you took James McAvoy's greatest flamboyant display of acting prowess, and put it in 2019's worst movie. McAvoy is acting for the Oscars, Shami is directing for the Razzies. Oh, and while McAvoy is personality shifting mid-conversation, you focused the camera on the other actors, or on the wall, not on his incredibly nuanced changes in facial gestures, because if you don't deserve an Oscar, then by hell is anyone in your movies ever getting any as well!

Baba is even worse than the villains, she is the main villain here. Having deprived the life of the only hero of this film (and a bunch of other people), she remained unpunished. The stupidity of the ending is off the charts.

Glass,"I suppose that if you have seen two other movies by M. Night Shyamalan, Unbreakable and Split, you might quickly figure out that this is the sequel that was previously alluded to, and it might be what you have been waiting for. You will be disappointed. The movie starts out well, but soon deteriorates into a formula super-hero action movie with some mystery, horror, and suspense thrown in. It is a M. Night Shyamalan movie, so it has a twist at the end, of course. Unfortunately, the twist is ridiculous and absurd, and it adds nothing. I suspect that its sole purpose is to set up yet another sequel in which the two twenty-somethings get married and have a baby with mutant powers. Bruce Willis does a good job playing the stoic hero and James McAvoy handles his role with precision. Samuel Jackson plays Samuel Jackson.","FEB 6, 2019",2,Thriller

Fifty Shades of Grey,"Some time ago a friend of my former partner involved herself in writing romance novels for a mass market publishing firm. She never showed any aptitude in writing before, but it was something to do next to running the family, which pinned her to her house for the better part of the day. The writing didn't ask much imagination as the stories were pretty formulaic. Like painting by numbers she just stayed within predefined boundaries and soon enough she cranked out another cheap novelette under the name of a non-existent writer such as D. J. Barding. The ingredients were always the same. The main protagonist was a woman aged twenty something to forty, single, and without any kids to tie her down. The man was in the same age range, but always a few years older, single as well, without romantic involvements. A setup to pursue their dalliance. Also the man was usually of a higher social standing and income group. She being a nurse, him being a doctor. She being a maiden, him being a lord. She being a student, him being a billionaire. And finally there was always something to surmount: a troubled past or a social barrier. The end saw the two joined in happy union. Usually. Sounds familiar? It is almost verbatim the story outline of fifty shades of grey. At this point you would expect me to start a long list of this movie's shortcomings, but I have to disappoint you for I am on the same page with the nostalgia critic in that this movie does the best with what it has got . In fact I will do one better. I find it a hilarious movie and it might be aiming for cult status by making a mockery of itself and of you. There are preposterous moments such as at the beginning when the female protagonist, Anna, tells to a friend that Grey is so clean. Wait. What did she just say? I checked and, heck, she says it: clean.. Grey is clean. This is her appraisal **** she just met. And somewhat further into the movie he pops up in the hardware store she is working in and starts buying things as tie ribs, ropes and chains. And I doubled over laughing. Was this a promise of things to come? Would she, later on, be subjected to what he is buying together with her there and then? And when he shows her his 'play room', a chamber done in black and red with racks filled with whips, floggers and canes - with only the bloody saw missing -, the only valid response would be to judge him **** crazy and flee, but instead she gapes as if he just revealed his private art collection, while at the same time listening to him telling her how he will use that stuff on her cause it is the only thing that turns him on. It is perfectly clear: they are seriously odd in the head. More hilarious moments follow when they come to the contract he so persistently insists upon. So we get a lengthy exposition of all the particulars of the fetish contract and she even calls for a meeting to go point for point through the contract discussing such things as the use **** clamps and anal fisting. All things he wants to do to her. Everything is off kilter in this movie that follows the prescription of a cheap romance flick but fills it with concepts that hail from the fetish world. He keeps on telling her how does not do the romantic thing, but for a large part of the movie he just does that, taking her with him in his helicopter, driving her around in his Lamborghini, taking her out for dinner and wooing her. He says A, but does B. And she believes B and ignores A. No wait she eventually begs him to do A. And when it happens she is really upset. This movie is a trashy romantic tale you wouldn't have wanted to see if it it hadn't held the promise of kinkiness. The sin of this movie therefore lies not with the movie, but with its detractors. What did you expect? Romeo and Jullia go kinky? Pride and Prejudice in skin tight leathers? Superheroes in latex instead of spandex? You knew it is crap. You know crap stays crap no matter what. Only in nature crap can produce roses. But ultimately what you wanted was PG rated kinky porn. That is by definition impossible. PG is not adult. If you want to see kinky porn go watch kinky porn. Histoire d'O springs to mind. This movie gets a ten because it makes a mockery of the source material and it exposes people for what they are: hypocrites. I am looking at you who goes to watch this on Valentine's day and gets disappointed! What where you thinking? But most of all because it gives a big middle finger to those who wanted so see their desire to have a continuous sexual stimulus, cloaked as having a 'special' relationship, a joining of spirits, vindicated and branded as a lifestyle. BDSM isn't. You do it cause it turns you on. Just like using butt-plugs all the time : it is a fetish. And it remains abuse if you need to hurt someone else for pleasure even if it is with consent and even if you label it differently. And that is what this movie shows you bondage fetishists and that is why you hate it.","NOV 16, 2015",9,Thriller

Fifty Shades of Grey,"It's inevitable to mention that ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" is one of the best films of 2015. It was not as painful as everyone thought. Undoubtedly ""Jurassic World"" , ""Star Wars"" , ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" and ""Furious 7"" marked path at the box office and critical overall but this year ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" boosted by its Valentine’s Day release, have been record-breaking. Globally, this film has attracted attention for the exciting and strange love story between English Literature student Anastasia Steele and billionaire businessman Christian Grey. The erotic trilogy of books left speechless the whole world and the film was not far behind, Its quality to capture every detail of the book in real life was more attractive to attract the attention of fans and non-fans. Dakota Johnson, daughter of actors Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, she was pleased to execute the Anastasia Steele character, She has done it a perfect way , showing virginity , innocence and sweetness of a woman who had never been in love, she was about to graduate, had the pressure of final exams, had to Jose hounding her and was about to go to a world full of dangers, alone. Jamie Dornan, after playing a serial murderer in BBC Two -The Fall, comes as a replacement of the first elected Charlie Hunnam . The question is : Would have done much better Charlie as Christian ? I doubt it.Jamie made an arduous and difficult work , fully achieve the character and that was evident. Significantly, relationship Anastasia - Christian was moderate and closely linked to aspects of the bestseller but the relationship Dakota - Jamie has fuelled speculation that the two stars can barely stand each other’s company. So Taylor - Johnson responded openly: "" The film's biggest single asset is Dakota Johnson: gone is the book's blithering simpleton "" Interestingly , despite controversy between Sam and James , low public confidence in this project , the low apparent affinity between the main characters and the difficulty of bringing to the screen a book that revolutionized the world ,""Fifty Shades of Grey"" achievement to be one of the best films of 2015 , so Fifty Shades Darker ( 2017 ) will not have an easy road because Sam will not direct the sequel, James Foley who will be in the director's chair. The film’s single biggest asset is Johnson, who has worked hard with Marcel and Taylor-Johnson to perform a three-woman salvage job on the character of Anastasia. Gone is the book’s blithering simpleton, with her arsenal of “holy hell”s and “double crap""s and “oh my""s. Her inner goddess is, thank goodness, nowhere to be found or heard. She is at no point a quivering, moist mess, and doesn’t make the ruinous error of thinking the word “f___” is an epithet. Grey, for obvious reasons, is much more likely to Anastasia for intimacy and mystery with which it has on the books. Personally , this film from start to finish was excellent , showing an introduction of a fairy tale , a totally aggressive and an end that surprised us . E. L .James' books are enigmatically catchers for the public but the film is undoubtedly the best of the best. The sex scenes are intense thermometer , which threatens to get red hot but not reach the top,and with more participation Dakota that what Jamie. You could say that the submissive from all angles captured is about to undress while the master is not sufficiently dominant achieving momentarily deflect the camera toward her. Even when Grey, with his riding crops and cat-o’-nine-tails and Red Room of Pain, would claim otherwise, these sequences stay well within the bounds of vanilla mainstream taste. Anastasia is no walkover here and sometimes gives as good as she gets, if not better. The funniest scene – debatably the sexiest, too – has the duo sitting at either end **** boardroom table, while Ana whips through the contract for their experimental relationship scratching out everything she won’t consent to. The script isn’t afraid to call a spade a spade here: “Find anal fisting. Strike it out.” It's amazing boom that had the soundtrack of the movie taking on its lists Ellie Goulding , The Weeknd , Sia, among others. Music is a quiet and elegant journey that distorts good way every erotic moment of the film, making them much more tolerable to hear groans and hits constantly . The punishment of the inner goddess is very worrying and surprising , and the pain she feels , makes us mourn everyone . ""One, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six"". The end of the movie is the best, leaving an open end and shaking us all with a simple "" No"". (This ending is much better than the book) There are no more words to praise the project, ""Sex, love, drama , romance , controversy , music , fame , pen and other things around to ""Fifty Shades of Grey""","NOV 16, 2015",9,Thriller

Fifty Shades of Grey,"This movie blows my mind. First of all, reading the book I could not pass the first chapter. English is not my native language but I went to college and I appreciate sophisticated vocabulary . I could not believe the poor language in the book. I thought a 12 years old have written it so I was not able to read it. The only reason why I went to the theater was that I loved both trailers and the soundtrack and of course all the talking attached to the movie. I went with my girlfriends because my bf totally refused to come with me. To du stride the movie had something magical attached to it. Till this day I can't say what it was because I know this production does not qualify fior an Oscar but there is totally something magical to it. I hardly ever watch the movie fit a second time but I can't wait till it's available on dvd. I want to mention that I was very upset that the movie was qualified as soft porn. Whoever calls it that has no idea what they are talking about. Sex scenes are very tasteful and you don't get see too much of private parts in the movie. It has never been close to a any kind of porn. Also the sex scenes are very brief and not the major plot in the movie. I know for some parts the movie doesn't make sense and makes you wonder what's really going on but it's very aintriguing and pleasant to watch. The music is outstanding and complements the story very well. Overall if you are a romantic female you might love the movie as I do, but if you are a guy expecting sine action you might get really disappointed. Another thing, anyone saying this movie is promoting domestic abuse is out of their mind because everything in the movie is consensual and presented in a really fascinating way.

It is a UNIQUE Story. Ana is testing her limits. 50 shades isn't a porno. It depicts one man's insecurity and need for control. It shows an inexperienced girl suddenly experiencing all these sensations and emotions. It shows one couple's epic love story, their pain, their lust, and their need for each other. They love each other, and their slowly admitting that to one another.

Fifty Shades of Grey,"To address a lot of the reviews stating this is glossed over domestic abuse, I have been in a relationship that was abusive to the point of having my bones broken and being emotionally and mentally terrorized. This movie is NOTHING like an abusive relationship and doesn't in any way ""teach"" women to stay in abusive relationships. It does however teach you to play with your partner safely, sanely and consensually. Anastasia was given a contract to go through, pages and pages of things to agree to or turn down, on top of being reminded often she could safe word out of any activity, she was really the one in control the entire time as all submissives are in the lifestyle. Now on to the rest of it. Anastasia desperate need to be loved, accepted, **** much she wanted to love him, please him, heal him and his hurt and anguish, all those emotions flying around, filling up the space between them, I felt like I was drowning in it, like...i couldnt see past the need to be loved that she felt. The connection emotionally between the two stole the entire movie for me. I barely even registered the BDSM play aspects at all I was so caught up in the emotional roller coaster between Anastasia and Christian. The sadness when those elevator doors closed at the end from them both was palpable. I really hope they do end up making the other movies and I truly hope the connection between the characters isn't lost along the way if different writers or directors are brought in.","FEB 26, 2015",10,Thriller
Fifty Shades of Grey,"Since the release of the film based on the book Fifty Shades of Grey, which has already broken box office records, I have been following the reaction of fans, after all, it is these fans who are interested in pleasing, not haters, much less specialized critics who have always trashed the written trilogy. without the slightest respect. Those who support any product are the people who like it. Harry Potter never won an Oscar in 10 years, not even for special effects, has anything changed? Twilight, for example, has 50 million followers on Facebook, and has always been massacred. So, did they (the overwhelming majority of them) like the film? The answer is that 90% yes, they loved it, but without leaving reservations. Much has been said that the film is very condensed, cuts a lot of things from the book and has lighter sex scenes, but the vast majority of fans also understand well how a film adaptation works, and that this is normal. The film's fidelity was highly praised, which was expected, since the author was always giving advice and deciding details behind the scenes of production. The biggest negativity in comments I found was when the official pages of the book and film suggested a relationship with Mr. Grey, which shows that sadomasochism scares many people, and some uninformed people even think it is violence, but it is minority.","FEB 19, 2015",10,Thriller

Fifty Shades of Grey,"I almost did not want to watch the movie because I know it is almost impossible to capture the essence of this or any other book on film. I did, however, enjoy the movie. I think the actors portrayed the characters well and told the love story that the book is **** the sex. When reading the book, the imagination is free to run wild and yes it is much more erotic than the film. I hated the ending as I hated the ending to the first book because it just makes you long for more.... So I immediately started to reread the 2nd book. Can't wait for the sequel.","MAR 8, 2015",8,Thriller
Fifty Shades of Grey,"I'm giving this a 10 in hopes to counteract the negative response it has gotten. I respect opinions but in response to comments like, 'is this what women get off to,' I have to object. I didn't 'get off' to this movie; I enjoyed the romance that was unusually portrayed because of Christian's idea of relationships. I didn't read the first book but after watching to movie and seeing the ending, I bought all three books and just finished the second. While the books are not intellectual, it's a good story, not great but not horrible. I loved the movie and I think Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan did very well at bringing these characters to life, could not imagine anyone else playing the part better. I cannot wait until the Fifty Shades Darker.","MAY 15, 2015",10,Thriller
Fifty Shades of Grey,"To be honest, I haven't read the book. So as you can see, the following will be just a vision created by what can be extracted from the movie itself: I gave it a mixed score because I considered it that way, such as if you have 0.5 and want to approximate it and the result gets to be 1. The actors are good, just that; they show failures and tend to overact, but, due to the film characteristics, that's just the minimal necessity for it. Now, what's important: the movie itself. The proposal its interesting and the exposure given to the viewers its creative; you don't usually see BDSM practice in movies, and even more, to be ""socially"" accepted. But that's not the principal thematic about the movie, the problem is that it gets to show hypocrisy. We have this ""relationship"" between Anastasia and Christian where he wants her to fit his profile and she tries to adapt to it, but it never gets fulfilled; there is always some sort of resistance between both, and mostly coming from Steele (which I find actually pretty funny), where she always plays with him, due to the intention from his to be ""dominant over the submissive"" but her intention is not to give in easily; that's the biggest problem and inconvenient coming from the film. They sell the movie as the ""romantic story"" which is in the dreams of every teenager fan of the book: Christian Grey plays with Anastasia Steele in order to obtain pleasure and satisfaction, but as the end of the movie exposes, if you retire the satisfaction from the act, then this one becomes hollow*, such as the movie. *Yes! The Imitation Game.","MAR 16, 2015",5,Thriller
Fifty Shades of Grey,"I am going to say that if you didn't read the book, a lot is not going to make sense to you, since lots of exposition was cut out (for time constraints), and we don't ""hear"" the endless tellings of Ana's Inner Goddess (which at least let you in a little bit about what the hell is going on, even if it was one of the worst parts of the book). That said, the movie was about as hokey as the book. I went to the movie to try to understand the characters better, and their motivations still make no sense. Even Grey, in the movie, basically tells us that that's just the way he is (with a possible transference from ""Mrs. Robinson""). Ana I just don't get. She is naive and curious, yes, but she just jumps full on into Grey's twisted world?! And at the last second when he actually physically hurts her (at her request), she does a 180? Obviously, they get back together (since there are 2 more books), so I assume we learn more about the characters, but a story needs to be complete in a single volume. The only reason I even gave the movie 5/10 (the book I would say is a 3) is because I wasn't totally bored, and Dakota was pretty damn good (Jamie not so much).","FEB 12, 2015",5,Thriller
Fifty Shades of Grey,"If I’m being honest, I should be damning the Fifty Shades film to hell. It’s an adaption of one of the most poorly written novels in recent memory and makes the Twilight trilogy’s Stephanie Meyers—which it initially originated from, being a fan fiction—look like J.D. Salinger. It’s also one of the poorest representations of the BDSM community I’ve ever witnessed and I’d argue that it’s actually about a mentally unstable man who uses “BDSM” to stabilize his sadist mind—if I took “erotic” fan fiction seriously. But Fifty Shades of Grey just wasn’t as unwatchable as I initially predicted it to be and, to my surprise, it has entertainment value—if not in its target audience, it has laughable dialogue, cheap acting performances, and an overall sense of silliness, the way it boasts the fetish it knows nothing of, which should make it a must-see for the ones who antagonize it most. But otherwise, this isn’t a film I wouldn’t particularly remember, for better or worse, if it weren’t for the controversy, criticism and cultural criticism surrounding it. It’s merely a mediocrity dressed in clothing that might catch everyone’s attention, both good and bad, but some of us who neither treasure nor hate this franchise see how unfitting it truly is.","MAR 3, 2015",4,Thriller
Fifty Shades of Grey,"When I went to see the film the weekend it came out, my expectations were limited. This is only because of the last few books made into films have not done well review wise since Hunger Games. That being said, I give this film an okay on the like and dislike meter; the dislike comes from the lack of forethought on the writers behalf. They refused to use proper transitions when cutting scene to scene; so, when someone who has read the books will wonder how the characters reached a certain point. Ex- when christen invites Ana and Kate to take photos of him for Kate's article, the script writers went from hardware store to the room where the photos were being taken. This happens throughout the whole film along with speedy line reading from Jamie Dornan, who refused to slow down and allow the audience to connect with what he was saying. There was also a lack of use with the supporting characters, their scenes were either speed up and disorienting or obsolete. The movie did not need Mia because Kate's brother Ethan was not mentioned in the film, and their was no reason for Ana's mom to be in the film either because the audience never even saw ""Ms. Robinson"" who was briefly mentioned and used way too aggressively. Furthermore, the film is 2 hours long, and the writers/directors could have used them more consciously instead of taking lines form the book and calling it a day.","FEB 12, 2015",6,Thriller

Fifty Shades of Grey,"A movie that thrives mostly on Dakota Johnson's performance as the central character ""Anastassia"". I enjoyed the chemistry between her and the stone-cold Christian Grey, played by Jamie Dornan, and it was really the only reason I could sit through 2+ hrs. of this adult version of Twilight. While the movie isn't that good at all, the relationship assessments were intriguing. The realization that relationships require trust to be built and maintained, and that anyone can have a dark sexual fantasy or skeleton in their closet that is unknown to the world is always fascinating and very real. Learning to release the shame and risk being vulnerable to another person scares the crap out of so many people in the world, but properly-placed trust offers incredible rewards, and I think that Christian Grey is on his way to learning that. The problem I have with that is there's two more books to address that, and I'm curious how anyone can muster up enough on-screen time to make any audience feel like they should show up. The first movie coasted on anticipation and controversy. A second and third film wouldn't benefit from that luxury. Perhaps Focus Features and the screen-adaptation can work to remedy any literary faults and find ways to charge the 50 Shades story with more interest, instead of relying solely on the sexual fantasies of women to find success.","MAY 20, 2015",5,Thriller
Fifty Shades of Grey,"As I kept watching 'Fifty Shades of Grey', I noticed a problem manifested as a paradox. Director Sam-Taylor Johnson would like to express Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan)'s traumatized mind, yet she is afraid to give any insight. The result of this is an over-insistent tone on his more superficial customs. He has his ties well-organized in a dresser, even his pencils are aligned perfectly on his desk and, apparently, he likes to play the piano after having sex. I don't recognize the tune, but to help get the director's point across, I assume is Nigel Tufnel's ""Lick my Love Pump"" from 'This Is Spinal Tap' (a must see masterpiece by the way). In a way, these images do offer a point, yet they can only do so much. This film follows an almost repeating pattern, in which Christian mingles with Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson), an English literature student in her senior year, they get closer and closer and eventually, have sex. This pattern does have a slightly progressive tone, as each time everything tries to become more insightful. Still, this is very unhealthy pacing because it decomposes what could have been one powerful scene into multiple weaker ones. The best examples are the countless sex scenes in the film. They are superficial, slow and even the later ones in which masochism comes into play are boring and, well, not hot. A true artist should never care about the audience when it comes to expression. You should channel your vision in an appropriate way, sure, but never watering it down. Yet I feel that Johnson thought that most of the audience for this film would be women so she played it safe. I can understand that, but the result is the aforementioned paradox which does not allow you to offer insight and depth; and I believe we should shock for the sake of pushing the art form. In the end, though, 'Fifty Shades of Grey' has moments of genuine chemistry between Grey and Anastasia, like when she drunk-calls him from a bar or when she is trying to get underneath his skin. I feel like we can relate with her character a lot. Is too bad that the director does not manage to sustain this insight and also I am sick of the constant slow naked caressing and Christian Grey's ideal man persona. When she tells Anastasia he plays the piano, her answer is what is on everyone's mind: ""Of course you do"".","NOV 4, 2018",5,Thriller

Fifty Shades of Grey,"I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. I read a bunch of reviews on it from other users and pro critics that gave the movie a bad rap, but again, I was pleasantly surprised. Now hold it before you start flaming me and **** because that's what the internet does just hear me out. A: A movie isn't bad because there is a lack of consent. That doesn't make a bad movie. Sure it makes a bad moral, doesn't give the right message, may encourage people, but that does NOT MAKE A BAD MOVIE. B: She does give consent, just not written. At the graduation scene she says OK to his request. Yes he perused her, but how many movies does the guy peruse the girl or vise versa? What makes this movie different? Just because they have explicit sex scenes in it? C: BDSM is OK. Personally, I do not like it. Does that mean whips, sticks, belts, rope, blindfolding, and gags are gross, horrifying, and disgusting? Of course! To me at least. People are into that kind of thing is a kink, and kink is wonderful. Hell people don't like my kinks or fetishes, some of which would be gross, horrifying, and disgusting to most people but that's peoples' kinks and there is nothing wrong with it. If you don't like it, that's not the movie's problem. It's yours, and why should the movie conform to your opinions? A movie is there to entertain you, and if you are not entertained by BDSM, then watch another movie, nobody is stopping you. There isn't a guy at the exit saying, ""You paid for this movie so that mean's you can't leave."" D: This isn't a **** dating movie. If I wanted to have an erotic time with my partner, I wouldn't want to have it in a theatre with a big sweaty guy with a box of milk duds sitting next to me. That, and I don't watch sex scenes with my partner because that's not what I'm into. Now that my rant is aside, the movie overall was a bit more than alright (that's a 5). The plot was surprisingly deep, showing us what a lack of communication can lead to. It also explores detrimental child abuse, the lack of two people not being able to mesh but have a deep infatuation with each other, a first relationship, and most importantly, how far can a relationship go when it's just based off of looks. It's quite emotional at parts as you feel either empathy/hatred for Grey or Anastasia. That's probably about the driving point of the film itself. The cinematography was good for the most part, scenery was great the whole way through, writing was... eh, and I'm sure glad it was a good adaptation and they didn't go strictly by the book. The only big problem I had was the acting. Not that it was all bad, but the contrast in quality between a good female role and a bad male role threw me off. Overall: a bit over a bogie, but not yet par.","MAR 12, 2015",6,Thriller

Fifty Shades of Grey,"After falling in love with the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy, not to mention absolutely obsessed with Christian Grey and Anastasia Steel's relationship, when I heard there was a movie coming out, I had mixed feelings. E.J. James does not get enough credit for her work and like me and most other public readers of Fifty Shades, myself and others are often immediately judged. I will state that E.J. James revolutionized writing as well as giving the women an option to enjoy ""porn"" instead of watching the nasty, totally unrealistic scenes on our computers. Therefore with all this in mind, I was excited for the movie, I watched interviews and the trailer about a billion times, I couldn't wait. Now, my boyfriend being the boyfriend he is he said, ""absolutely not"" when I asked him to go see it on opening night with me, so I pushed it off until now. My person opinion is... This book is freaking hard to make into a movie and I give the directors, play writers etc... credit for giving it their best shot, but like myself and others, we all let our imaginations run wild while reading this book therefore this movie maybe appealed to someones imagination... but not mine and my roommates in particular. I thought this movie would appeal more to men than women, by this I mean I'm not trying to see boobs every other scene, but I do understand it is part of Christian Grey's ""fifty shades."" But this is a female fantasy/ book therefore the movie should appeal to us women! Another point, this movie moved WAY too fast! I get it you need to fit a 500 page book into a two hour movie but holy cow did they miss the connection making between Christian and Ana! I don't want to harp on this movie because like I said, it is near to impossible to appeal to everyone's imaginations. My last point would be, if you read the books and enjoy a good movie, go to the movie anyways because Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan do a fantastic job on what will probably be the hardest role they will ever play. All in all, if you haven't read the books, read them. If you haven't seen the movie and have the opportunity, like me, to go to $5 movie night take the opportunity to go see it with your girlfriends and go home to your hubbies and see what fifty shades you can come up with!","FEB 16, 2015",6,Thriller
Fifty Shades of Grey,"Of course this movie is ridiculous, everyone gets that. Most romance novels/movies at least try to have a pretense of reality, e.g. down on his luck but sexy cowboy, workoholic tv producer, etc, but not this one. The plot/fantasy is basically right out of a high school girl's diary: a helicopter flying, piano playing, extremely attractive, 27-year-old billionaire picks you out of a crowd for no reason and obsesses over you. It's more over the top than most romance flicks, but that's to be expected. What I didn't expect was that a romance-novel movie with such an over-the-top premise would be so unbelievably un-sexy. This doesn't really qualify as a guilty pleasure, because almost an hour in the only excitement you get is a 2 minute chopper ride and some discussion of contract law. The film barely manages any suspense or temptation, and despite several minutes of build-up, Grey's (spoilers) pleasure room is really underwhelming. I went in expecting it to be a bad guilty pleasure, but instead Fifty Shades of Grey is a really, really expensive-looking spectacle to be gawked at and laughed at.","DEC 2, 2015",4,Thriller

Mainly though, in terms of the sex, if you have seen a single porn in your life then it wont be anything even remotely shocking. The sex was very PG, and it was much more about foreplay, or whatever it is that women like and think about so much. That was basically the whole point of the film was some kind of long drawn out sexual foreplay. But without even much sex.

Fifty Shades of Grey,"Spank me like you do. This film was undoubtedly one of the biggest box office hits of the decade, but it was largely due to the already dizzying success of the original material, the erotic novels by E. L. James. I have no doubt that the audience that went to see this film did it out of curiosity or because they had previously read the books and liked it. So, the film already had a well defined target audience. But as I have not read the books (nor do I intend to) I will speak only of the film. Overall, I found the plot very weak. Anastasia Steele is a shy, sexually inexperienced young woman who immediately feels a strong attraction to Christian Gray, a young millionaire with an almost latent aggressiveness. From there, the two have a relationship full of fetishes of authority and pain, where the romance insists on arising and leaving both confused and bewildered, especially Gray, who seems to carry a lot of childhood traumas and like to discount all that on the body. of their young sex slaves. This is the plot of the film, and I am aware that the book is the same, but the truth is that it makes no sense, if we take into account the normal and expected reactions between a man and a woman ... Observe carefully: first, it is almost impossible to find, today, a young adult totally inexperienced in bed and in sex. It can happen, of course, but it is rare. The first meeting between them is also something that could only happen in a book: Anastásia, who should interview Gray, is so tense and shy that she doesn't even know what she is doing! And he, a very busy man, gives ten minutes to a young woman who has not rigorously prepared herself for the interview she wanted to do! He is an intense, even brutal man, who could have any woman, but he is enchanted by the tastiest girl on the planet. Even so, he does not intend a normal courtship, but a sexual and possession relationship, bureaucratic, well defined on paper, forgetting that quickly when the desire and passion became uncontrollable. And everything happens in a fraction of ... days? One day she is in his office, not knowing what to ask him and, a short time later, she is relaxed talking to his mother as if she were already part of the family. None of this makes sense, but this is just a bit of the absurdities of the whole story, common to the film and books. Dakota Johnson is perfect for her character, as she is a totally uninteresting woman, who could go unnoticed by the eyes of the most ardent of males. For his part, Jamie Dornan is too kind and friendly to be Christian Gray. His character should harmoniously combine the beauty and virility of a young adult with a more mature and somber personality than normal at his age and some brutality and strength of character. I even dare to think that the ideal actor for Gray should be (or appear to be) slightly older than Dornan. The rest of the cast is OK but has no room to do anything really good. The dialogues are hideous, and if they originated from the book then I did well not to read it. It goes without saying, I believe, that this film is totally inappropriate for children and teenagers, given the heavy erotic material and the language used. The film's nudity is something that the fans considered residual, but I would consider it too much if it did not take into account the original material in which the film. The film has good production values, starting with good photography, good scene props (it would highlight the famous red room and all its paraphernalia), satisfactory editing work and, above all, a good soundtrack, which is in the heard and has good songs (I would highlight ""Earned it"" and ""Love me Like You Do""). In short: when starting with bad source material, the film was doomed from the start. The only thing that made E. L. James's book good for the cinema was the number of copies sold and the absolute guarantee that the film would sell equally.","FEB 19, 2020",3,Thriller
Fifty Shades of Grey,"Just no...Seriously, it's a very boring film that went far longer than necessary and without a central, well-written plot to guide it.

Fifty Shades of Grey,"Absolutely hilarious to watch if you're anything like me and enjoy some cringe from time to time. It's rigid performances and sobering book accuracy make for one of the most unnatural romance films in recent history. There is no chemistry here,no drama,no concerning conflict. Just a billionaire with unresolved ptsd and a God complex. It's unfortunate how seeing the supposedly sexy words that captured many on pages be said by real life people without discernable irony such as the repulsive flirting post contract negotiation or the now infamous don't make love I **** To be honest I can't really admonish the film as it didn't have a lot to go on but with that said the actors didn't help. Jamie Dornan is unwatchable as the presumably (I presume because it's never expressed) sexy bachelor, he feels wooden and not in the intended way Christian was written (albeit terribly) to be. Dakota Johnson at least attempts and is unsuprisingly the only one willing to go bare for the sake of her charater. Another thing I found frustrating was how no arcs were explored satisfyingly such as José attempted assault, the family dinner,his intimacy issues,Anna's fears etc. They just use every scene as interludes b4 they f ,nit as opportunities to develop characters. Overall this is a sprawling yet bare 2hr disappointment that I can't stop chastising.","DEC 21, 2022",0,Thriller

I read two of the three books out of pure curiosity, but started skipping entire pages and later chapters just to get through the book. Who has sex three or four times a day!? The books are childlike and absolutely boring. Also, they have no storyline other than two people permanently having sex, a woman with no backbone and an absolutely narcissistic controlling man! Also, if you tell a guy that you are still a virgin, his response should NOT BE let me help you with that problem!!! The movie and the books are creepy. Since when has it become sexy for a woman not to be able to choose how she wants to dress, what she wants to eat, where she wants to go....even her cellphone, exercise and waxing habits are under his control. She is basically just a possession. The movie is rated 16 only! Not nearly enough. I sat in the movies with giggling 16-18 year olds and thought to myself this movie should not be seen by anyone younger than 25 and in a healthy relationship with common sense to realize that this is not healthy or normal. I would feel ashamed if I was the parent who allowed my 16 year old to watch this movie! This is the basis that these emotionally fragile children will build their relationships on one day!

Fifty Shades of Grey,"This ""movie"" is just complete **** drivel. The reason I say ""movie"" like that is because this is not a movie. It just isn't. Fifty Shades Of Grey is two hours of endless awkward BDSM that lacks chemistry or any kind of passion. I thought it would never end. Anastasia Steele has to interview Christian Grey because Anastasia's roommate has a cold for five minutes. The first 15-20 minutes are basically just this generic character meets character stuff and when I was supposed to feel some sexual tension between Steele and Grey, I was actually just waiting for the scene to end lol. The rest of this ""movie"" is either that awful awkward BDSM stuff or some even more awful melodrama between Grey, Steele and sometimes Steele's friends and family because every now and then some other characters need to appear on scene to tell something that doesn't even matter in the end. It's honestly just absolute tosh. At one point Grey literally says ""I'd be pleased to discover that you're naked underneath"" when he's talking about taking Steele's dress off. The dialogue is absolutely terrible, the directing is bland, the acting and casting is just absolute red anus. Am I seriously supposed to believe that a character portrayed by Dakota Johnson is this awkward, quiet and low confident woman who desperately needs a man to be able to live? Or at least that's her character for the first 30 minutes. After that she just randomly starts talking a lot more and eventually does all this BDSM stuff with Grey. Steele is not the only character in the movie though to just randomly change. Early in the movie Grey takes Steele to a hotel and tells her that he slept next to her, and then later refuses to sleep in the same bed with her because he apparently doesn't do stuff like that. Later in the movie we get two almost identical scenes of Steele and Grey flying while some popular song is playing in the background. These scenes have almost no meaning to anything, other than appealing to fans of that music genre I guess. Overall there's pretty much nothing for anyone here. I'm sure people can find a lot of BDSM elsewhere that isn't scattered throughout a two hour movie if they want to see it so bad. I guess there was a nice slow remake of a Beyonce song, and the colors in the movie looked alright. That is all!","FEB 17, 2018",1,Thriller

Fifty Shades of Grey,"Hopefully, as a heterosexual female student in her twenties with a love of film that spreads across all genres and decades, this will come over as a fair assessment of a film that genuinely did nothing for me. Have not read the books, though have heard conflicting opinions that has mostly been intense dislike. The reason for watching 'Fifty Shades of Grey' was not due to wanting to hate on it, being a negative person, curiosity but for the reason of being at a film night with friends recently and 'Fifty Shades of Grey' happened to be the film choice. Just for the record, the general consensus ranged from indifference to hating it with a passion. There are two minor pros. The best thing about 'Fifty Shades of Grey' is most of the beguiling soundtrack, that has a soothing nostalgia and appropriately amorous quality, this is all for the song choices though. 'Fifty Shades of Grey' also looks good, nice use of scenery and very nicely shot. On the other hand, Danny Elfman's score is one-note and repetitive, as well as too derivative of his recent work. He has composed some wonderful stuff ('Edward Scissorhands' is magical) but this is really not his best work. The direction has slickness but overall is too mannered which really affects the film's tone and pacing. Regarding the acting, none of the supporting cast are of note, including Marcia **** Harden, but a larger issue is the two leads and their complete lack of chemistry. Understated can be a lovely quality to acting, as long as it also becomes nuanced and with believability given to the dialogue. Dakota Johnson, especially in the first third, is too understated that it feels more like there is a lack of personality or emotion. Jamie Dornan looks uncomfortable throughout, delivers his cringe-worthy lines awkwardly and is just bland as dishwater with no charisma whatsoever. Chemistry is non-existent. 'Fifty Shades of Grey's' dialogue does them absolutely no favours, dialogue so bad that absolutely nobody (even the best actors and actresses) can do anything with it. It causes unintentional laughter throughout, is embarrassingly clunky and is pure smut. Then there is the story that is so thin structurally, heavy in repetition, so badly plodding and without style or atmosphere that the film feels twice as long, with the sexual elements done far too tamely and the BDSM portrayal deceitful. None of the characters are engaging or interesting, practically ciphers. All in all, a very poor film with two minor pros and the rest of the film massively flawed. 2/10 Bethany Cox","MAR 22, 2022",2,Thriller

Trainwreck,"""Trainwreck"" stars Amy Schumer in this comedy drama about a single lady acting more like a single man in today’s dating game with able assists from Bill Hader, Brie Larson and John Cena. Written by Ms. Schumer and directed by Judd Apatow, this film amply displays the acting talents of Ms Schumer as well as her extraordinary writing talents. Deeply moving in the relations Ms. Schumer’s character has with her sister and divorced father, the film is able to generate great pathos and sentiment while at the same time causing us to laugh and appreciate each moment. LeBron James, playing himself, has a significant role in the move and together with other notable NBA figures, gives a degree of authenticity and honesty to the story. Most of all it is Ms. Shcumer’s film for she proves once again that the transition from comedy to drama is easier to achieve for a comic than it is for a dramatic star to do comedy.. This is a thoroughly enjoyable film to watch and to experience great writing as well. I give the film 3 and ½ stars and recommend it to audiences and viewers of all ages.","AUG 29, 2015",9,Drama
Trainwreck,"Amy Schumer was very good and the movie was much better than Apatow's most recent ventures. There are a number of laughs, probably fewer if you are easily offended. The script needed editing, as the movie is too long and drags at spots. But it is funny. At times, really funny. I'm not sure LeBron saying ""let me aks you"" was necessary.

Judd Apatow adds his masterful comic direction to make every gag work even better.

Trainwreck,"This is a comedy drama film with romance elements and it covers themes including funerals, arguments and father and daughter relationships. Perhaps a better term to use to describe it would be a 'relationship comedy drama', as it isn't really big on romance but its very much about one persons relationships, just not in a sentimental way for the most part. It is a quite contemporary , somewhat slick comedy/drama - I suppose you could say its a rom/com style of a film, only (as you might have guessed) its not exactly full of sentimental romance, featuring more of a 'ladette' character. Some of the comedy I didn't particularly find funny but other instances I did. The comedy is sometimes quite observational based and its fair to say that a number of characters are quite sharp and 'to the point', including the main character, Amy. Her boss, Dianna, reminded me of the **** boss in 'The Devil Wears Prada', Miranda Priestly. I wasn't convinced this film would especially appeal to me, as I don't tend to particularly like films featuring loud and brash female US comedians, usually but I'd read good write-ups of this and having found it to be on Netflix, I obviously gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised. I suppose it is a little reminiscent of Sex & The City, although perhaps slightly less explicit. There are some cringe-worthy moments present, as you'd probably expect, with some awkward situations depicted. Cast wise, Amy Schumer plays the main character, Amy Townsend. She is quite outspoken and assertive but her mouth gets her in to some problems at times, which made me laugh at times. She looks like quite an average sort of a person but the character she's depicting seems like the sort of person most everyone has encountered at one point or another - someone so brash she gets the better of herself at times. Other cast members include Tilda Swinton as her boss Dianna, Colin Quinn as Gordon, John Cena as Steven and Brie Larson as Kim. Content wise, the film contains partial nudity, male nudity (no female nudity), sex scenes with nothing graphic visually shown and numerous sex references, plus strong language and multiple drug references (including references about the taking of drugs). There is a minor element of violence although its pretty mild. The film has been given a 15 rating to reflect this. All in all, I found this equally cringe-y and a bit embarrassing at times (the prude that I am(!)) and also surprisingly funny and amusing at other times. It is silly, a bit wacky and it most certainly isn't original from a plot/script point of view, plus it became a little cheesy towards the end but I can't deny that I enjoyed it, got a few laughs and was glad that I'd seen it overall. Unsurprisingly, yes I would recommend this film. Ok I wouldn't recommend it specifically for watching in front of your parents or anything like that, as it is quite saucy in parts but its not as sexual as some shows/films and I did find myself laughing at times. The main character is somewhat relatable and endearing perhaps, at a pinch but in any case, the cast is decent and I was surprised that I enjoyed watching it as much as I did but I did, so, obviously due to this I would overall recommend it, yes.","NOV 23, 2021",8,Drama

But about 2/3 of the way through the film, it loses some steam. However, it ends really well.

There doesn't always need to be guns and clowns to get someone to laugh. My theater was roaring from laughter – more than any slapstick comedy I can remember. This movie actually followed like a real movie should. A decent plot, character development, and the nonsensical female stereotypes were rarely followed. Maybe I have low standards knowing what this movie's up against, but color me impressed. Amy Townsend held her own and that's something to be proud of. This was her story, not Aaron's. And the comical interjections from LeBron James couldn't have been better. All tied together with an air of realness. We all know someone that's ill, someone with an addiction. We know someone who can't be faithful to their partners. We know someone who's an **** and someone who needs to change. Those people are us, our friends, our family. We have these problems and now we can laugh at them too. It's about realizing what's important in life, but still not taking it too seriously. It is Amy Schumer after all.","JUL 29, 2015",7,Drama

I don't know how to explain it but it was a tough scene to make funny. Physical comedy is tough in an extended scene like that. I also thought Lebron and Amare were surprisingly good actors.

It offers up the opportunities for some wonderful supporting cameos from the likes of Ezra Miller, John Cena and especially Tilda Swinton. Unrecognizable beneath her very convincing make up Swinton steals every scene she is in as Schumer’s viperish boss and is is an absolute hoot! Schumer herself has great comic timing and carries the character confidently and convincingly to the only really conventional thing about the movie, the ending.

A lot of the cameos were underwhelming and the magazine article story was underdeveloped. But man, Amy is a genius and the jokes are often pitch perfect. This film will be divisive as Amy Schumer, the force, is divisive. Chauvinistic men who think women can't be funny will hate this film when they go with their girlfriends to see it. And they'll definitely hate all male nudity in it. In FamilyGuy117's review below, he basically calls her a disease-infested ****. Funny, he's probably never had a problem with all the male-centric comedies where the protagonists **** their ways through scenes filled with gratuitous **** and full-frontal female nudity. But now that the tables are turned? Suddenly he ""needs a shower"" after watching this one! Which makes him a double ****. ****! ****! Seriously though, so many good laughs in this film. Physical comedy. Cerebral comedy. And yes, toilet humor including a (bloody) funny tampon joke. This is Judd Apatow after all, who has given us lots of dude-centric ****, **** and piss jokes over the years. So what. This film won't be for everyone. Especially not for male chauvinists. But it was for me! Can't wait to see it again.","JUL 18, 2015",9,Drama
Trainwreck,"I finally got around to seeing this, due to the fact that I was really on the fence as to whether I wanted to see this one or not, because I really enjoy Judd Apatow and his films, but I also can't stand Amy Schumer. It also doesn't help that I'm generally not a fan of rom-coms. Believe it or not, I was actually pleasantly surprised with this one. Not only did Schumer manage to not annoy the crap out of me (for most of it at least), but it also had a lot of really funny moments, great one-liners, and some fun cameos (John Cena, LeBron James, Method Man, even Daniel Radcliffe and Marisa Tomei!) In addition, it also had a surprising amount of heart to it, which I certainly wasn't expecting. Overall, depending on your tolerance for rom-coms in general, you may or may not enjoy it. On the other hand, if you can get past that and you happen to be a fan of Apatow and his previous films, I'd say it's definitely worth a view.","JUL 29, 2015",8,Drama

Jurassic World Dominion,"The final installment of the Jurassic World trilogy is a fun movie, but falls short being the finale. The movie should have trimmed out some unnecessary scenes, at times it was boring and dragged on. The final fight was a bit of a let down. Compared to previous films in the series, the dinosaurs feel the least threating, as barley anyone dies in the movie. It would have been far better if they did not include the locust storyline as it felt out of place and forced with the rest of the movie. With the exception of the Giganotosaurus, the new dinosaurs were all amazing additions. The Therizinosaurus was especially great, as well as some new prehistoric animals not included in the trailers. The main human villain was mediocre and forgettable. The Giganotosaurus was a disappointment and boring. The parts of the movie that do work, however, are amazing. The dinosaurs are by far the best part of the film. The inclusion of the original characters was also a welcomed addition. Overtime, hopefully others will warm up to Dominion.","JUL 19, 2022",7,Thriller

Jurassic World Dominion,"When I think of Jurassic Park film , I remember the cinematography masterpiece of the first part that starts especially in the middle of the movie. which was the accepted effect of a movie in the 2 previous years . (though not the impression that remains in imitation). In the Jurassic Park 1993, none of the dinosaurs change into form, but the behavior that the characters emit in front of it creates an image of them in the mind. Maybe that's why we hardly feel such a void. . The most powerful sequence of jurassic world 2022 is when one of the dinosaurs looks at the surface of the water,like the most powerful sequence of jurassic park 1993 when looks at the car. Here too, none of the dinosaurs transform into a **** brilliance of Spielberg to definition of the narrative covers the Plot's flaws in Jurassic park. Of course, I think that after some time, Spielberg himself came to the conclusion to use the sense of humor, but this sense of humor or caricature or darkness or the softness aspect should be done in the form of dinosaurs. Not to make dinosaurs that look too natural and serious while deflecting the sense of humor in a different angle. The action senses related to the Clare are perfect ; the rest are istereotype. 3/75/5","MAR 1, 2023",9,Thriller

Jurassic World Dominion,"'Jurassic World Dominion' is far from perfect, if just about entertaining to watch... kinda. I'm not fully convinced by it but I do think there's enough in there that's worth watching. There are too many characters, even main characters with the original trio and the newer duo both involved equally. With that said, I do like 'em. It's pleasant to see Sam Neill, Laura Dern and Jeff Goldblum, while Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard are a good pairing. Still, I wouldn't say any one character stands out here. They all make their presence known, though I'm struggling to remember any great moments individually - that's due to the aforementioned surplus. The rest of the cast, fwiw, are all fine - Mamoudou Athie sticks out most in that regard. The run time is overlong, in my opinion. I personally could've done without 30 or so minutes and I wouldn't have felt it was missing anything. The story itself isn't all that fresh, as in I feel like I've seen this sorta thing before (I mean, Biosyn... how creative!), but the barrage of dinosaur-centric action probably just abouts tips it over into a positive rating for yours truly. Could easily be lower, though. I'd love for this to be the end of the Jurassic franchise (is there much more to tell?) but there ain't no way Amblin/Universal are leaving this IP to collect dust, let's be honest.","JUL 13, 2022",7,Thriller

Jurassic World Dominion,"Bigger and scarier dinosaurs, heart-pounding sound effects, and plot twists mixed with plenty of adventures are just what you can expect from Jurassic World Dominion! From the beginning to the end of the movie, there are tons of action-packed scenes to keep you literally jumping for more. Fans of the Jurassic Park franchise will not be disappointed. Jurassic World Dominion centers around two different storylines. On one hand, Maisie Lockwood (Isabella Sermon), a teenager, who happens to be a clone of her biological mother, is kidnapped and taken to a company called Biosyn to become a science experiment so scientists can learn how her biological mother created her. On the other hand, her parents, Claire Dearing (Bryce Dallas Howard) and Owen Grady (Chris Pratt), set out on an adventure to rescue her. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern) is suspicious of the works of Biosyn and its animal experiments, as well as its attempt to take over the food chain. She brings in Alan Grant (Sam Neill) to help her stop Biosyn from taking over. The two storylines eventually combine for one suspenseful adventure that happens to take place all while dinosaurs are threatening the characters' existence. The main characters in this film are Maisie, Claire, Owen, Alan, Ellie, and Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum). There are references and character appearances from other movies in the Jurassic Park franchise. I enjoyed seeing how characters from different parts of the film join together to save Maisie and end up trying to save each other and become a family while working together. There are some funny scenes throughout the film, and I loved seeing the characters communicating with the dinosaurs and even making them promises. The movie takes you on an emotional rollercoaster as you root for the good guys to not only survive but to win. This film touches on family and whether or not dinosaurs and humans can co-exist. You’ll have to watch the movie to find out. While I highly enjoyed Jurassic World Dominion, this film may not be suitable for people who have certain fears/anxieties or even suffer from PTSD. Parents should look out for scenes with extreme violence, gory deaths, and loads of jump scares. I give Jurassic World Dominion 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for kids ages 12 to 18, plus adults.

I had the toys and would dress up playing ""dinosaur."" I even had a ""vest"" pretending I was Dr. Grant haha. Goes without saying, I'm a huge Jurrasic Park fan. I just saw this movie on Saturday with my wife, and we both absolutely loved it! First off, they did a really good job bringing back the original characters and blending their storylines with the new cast. The dialougue between them, the way they interacted, was really well written and well acted. The writers were careful to pay their respects to the original cast. They didn't rush any scenes. They spent time on each scene/gave time for things to develop. They were in ""true character/how they would have acted in the originals. This means everything to fans! Well done! Also, we were so happy to see how they added to the original characters' storyline, as I am sure other fans are also (I won't spoil anything :)).

Jurassic World Dominion,"Dominion is a satisfying conclusion to the series that goes out with a bang. 5 out of 5 stars. Jurassic World Dominion is an awesome science fiction action film that ends the series in a high note. And takes the Jurassic Park film which it never has been there before. Feeling different from the previous films. Which some may enjoy or some will miss the nostalgia of being back in the island with dinosaurs. The plot follows with people trying to coexist with dinosaurs. Some are amazed by the creatures living among them. While others are breeding and using them for an evil agenda. The plot follows Owen (Chris Pratt) and Claire (Bryce Dallas Howard) who are living in hiding and trying to keep Maise (Isabella Sermon) safe. After the previous film and discovering her secret. While Ellie (Laura Dern) discovers prehistoric locusts that are destroying the farm fields and can be leading to our extinction. Which she enlists Alan (Sam Neill) and Ian (Jeff Goldblum) to help out and find out who is behind that. Which are the same people that Owen and Claire are looking for after they kidnap The raptor Blues baby. The plot has a couple of storylines that intercept and feels different than previous films. Which makes it feel like a globe trotting action thriller as Claire and Owen come across hybrid mixed raptors that are weaponized to attack certain people. Leading to a motorcycle chase scene in Malta. The action sequences are awesome. The visual effects are great. The cast ensemble is great. Its nice to see the original trio Sam Neill, Laura Dern, and Jeff Goldblum back in action. I also love they brought one original character from the first movie back into the mix as a villain in this film. If your a fan of the series when the name is popped up. You will easily recognize. The film music score is also great. For a long running time with the movie. It does feel fast moving and short with the movie running into one action set piece to another.

But it does several things right, starting with bringing back the original characters including Dr. Grant, Ellie Sattler, Ian Malcolm, and Henry Wu. And not just in fan-servicing cameos, but as major players in the plot. The chemistry is great between them and also with Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard. The girl playing Maisie is unfortunately another flat, humorless, and wooden actress in the mold of Daisy Ridley (Rey from Star Wars). Great shout-outs to the original movie, like the Barbasol can and the characters stuck in a jeep that's either rolling down a hill or being swatted around by a hungry dinosaur. Several fun action scenes. The plot is absurd, and the idea of dinosaurs running loose in the wilds and roaming our city streets would be complete chaos in the real world, not to mention the end of countless mammals in our ecosystems. It would also bring camping to an end as a pastime. Sure, let's go to Yellowstone, just keep an eye out for those raptors! Henry Wu is given more to do in his return, which was nice to see. While silly, the film is consistently entertaining, which puts it ahead of a lot of recent action/fantasy films and shows (Star Wars, Marvel, cough). A fun two-plus hours.","JAN 8, 2023",7,Thriller

Never seen or heard before, Not so romantic or funny, totally boring. I thought She might be Will Ferrell's sister. I'm kind of frustrated because of either the movie or the actors were not excited to keep going with my watch. This is the same old story, but instead it's a woman's version. A playgirl loses the someone who loves her sincerely for what she's and later finds the one true love of her life, but it ends in a disaster due to her past. So how everything is going to be fixed is what brings curtain to the narration. It might be a well known plot, but a well crafted movie as well by one of the best comedy filmmaker who has given many awesome ones. Despite his effort to make it big it is also his bottom of the list from his filmography. Well, not all the actors were so bad, John Cena was so funny with his **** jokes, but lot like in a guest appearance. The basketball superstar that I don't know him.

Trainwreck,"Director/producer Judd Apatow (The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up) brings his brash and irreverent comic sensibilities to the traditional romantic comedy through the female perspective of writer and star Amy Schumer, America’s current black-sheep darling who proves that the girls can get just as lewd and outrageous as the boys. ‘Trainwreck’ is the brainchild of current superstar comedienne and US media darling Amy Schumer, who brings her brutally honest comic sensibilities and semi-autobiographical experiences to what is essentially a traditional romantic comedy, featuring a girl with commitment issues and traumatic life experiences who gets a chance at real love only to ruin it before ultimate redemption. This film is to some extent a social satire that takes pop-shots at relationship dramas and our vacuous celebrity-obsessed society, only to then undermine itself by relying heavily on often cringeworthy celebrity cameos, but Schumer is the star of the show here with her comedic stylings just about shining through and with a surprisingly convincing dramatic performance in the few moments where pathos tempers the comedy. Despite several legitimately hilarious moments and the rarity of having a feminine perspective on the lewd outrageous adult comedy, ‘Trainwreck’ is still your run-of-the-mill Rom-Com with a traditional and predictable 3-act structure, essentially; quirky girl set in her ways meets good guy who turns her world upside down, she can’t handle it and her love and life falls apart, only for her to see the light achieve redemption where everything turns out great. The Bottom Line… Director Judd Apatow manages to transfer some of Amy Schumer’s TV & stand-up comedic talents to the big screen in an often side-splitting irreverent comedy from a rare female perspective, but ultimately ‘Trainwreck’ it too familiar to stand out in the comedy movie crowd and loses too much steam to be memorable on its way to a predictable and unsatisfying conclusion.","AUG 14, 2015",6,Drama

Half of Amy Schumer's jokes just weren't funny, and it **** because it had such great potential. On top of that, every character felt flat.

I think she would be better suited for the obnoxious friend of the main girl. Bill Hader does a solid job but is mostly forgettable. Honestly, the only reason this film is worth watching is for the plethora of celebrity cameos, highlighted by LeBron James. They all play versions of themselves in hilarious skits that fit neatly into the plot.

The movie follows Amy whose main claim to fame in the movie is that she is a slut. She meets Bill Hader's character, and decides being a slut isn't all that it is cracked up to be. The general plot and final outcome (spoiler they find love!) was never in doubt. I was just hoping that going from points A to B in the movie would be entertaining. It was not.

Trainwreck,"The title is just as (somewhat) non-laughable as the plot. From the director who gave us ‘The 40 Year Old Virgin’ and 'Knocked Up’; director Judd Apatow is back with a somewhat laughable, but messy comedy. When it comes to the humor is it always hard to get everyone entertained, and this 'wreckish’ movie is no exception. I laughed out at several occasions, but I had no interest in the plot what so ever, it just dragged on. This is my own personal opinion, and some of you will of course love the movie. This is because of several aspects. One is without any doubt the characters, which are relatable, lovable and well presented. The acting is just as phenomenal. The directing is very well done, and even though it got its flaws did I still enjoy it much more than I thought I would. Team Schumer-Hader (Amy Schumer & Bill Hader) did an amazing job, but as I previously mentioned is the story so messy and non-entertaining and it’s sad that such great characters can’t exist in a great world. The whole movie therefor felt non-rememberable. The humor is still great from time to time, but it’s also somewhat predictable, even though the whole movie is much less 'clichéish’ than what I expected to see. Is it still worth it? Perhaps! 'Trainwreck’ (except the humor and the plot) is really good, but from a personal viewpoint did I still find it a bit boring, but it might work for you!

The perfect complement to director Judd Apatow who litters his tales with dirty words and sex but is actually as innocuous as a Kate Hudson rom-com from the last decade. In fact, I would argue that BRIDE WARS has a more cutting and daring message to deliver than TRAINWRECK or any of Schumer's or Apatow's work. Pile on to that, TRAINWRECK is simply too long, lethargic, and just not very funny. And perhaps worse than anything, poor Brie Larson, who is quite the actress, is here relegated to playing the sister/homemaker with no bite or attitude. TRAINWRECK just made me feel sad in an unintentional bad way. Perhaps we will soon get the truly daring female comedian we really need.

I don’t feel like it is a bad movie I just feel like its more **** comedy film than a film for a male audience. Amy Schumer’s audience is women and I think she was more attentive to her audience when writing the film. I also found her character a little unoriginal, although Schumer may be in some ways going into a area where many women have not gone it is still very similar to other actors. I found there were several points in the film where I felt like I was watching a female Seth Rogen. There is really nothing wrong with Schumer’s performance I just didn’t understand the huge critical acclaim. Bill Hader is great in the movie and he was very likeable and it is nice to see him gain more attention as he has been a background player for so long. The other complaint I have with this movie is that I really didn’t find the leads as funny as the supporting cast. Schumer had her moments but Bill Hader was not that funny at all and normally he’s hilarious. Lebron James is really funny in this film and John Cena might have been the funniest guy in the film despite not sticking around for long. There is also a little two much of a sports side to this movie, it almost seems like Apatow is trying to re-create Jerry Maguire and I think there are points that take away from the main plot and there were just too many sports related cameos. I feel like I have hated a little two hard on the film but it really was not bad, I just think it wasn’t for me.

Trainwreck,"As a fan of Amy Schumer and her Comedy Central series (where she takes amazing chances, the 12 Angry Men parody was brilliant), I was a bit let down by her big screen debut as star and writer. Of course there is a great difference between writing a 5 minute (or 22 minute) sketch and a full length feature, and perhaps under Judd Apatow's (never met a 90 minute film that can't be padded to over 2-2 1/2 hours) direction and guidance, she didn't tighten the script firmer. There are many, many laughs to be sure. And the supporting cast is crammed with talent. All the talk is about Lebron James, but what about John Cena (hilarious), Colin Quinn, Vanessa Bayer, Randall Park, Jon Glaser, Mike Birbiglia, hell, Tim Meadows absolutely kills in the small cameo he appears in...Although the main character is an mess, the movie follows the standard rom-com formula. Couple meet, fall in like, conflict pulls them apart, they get together after one of them realizes that they DO love them..Some scenes could have been trimmed and one, the intervention with Chris Evert, Mathew Broderick and Marv Albert (YES!!) could have been cut completely. I will admit whatever faults Apatow has as a director, he does let his cast shine from top to bottom.","JUL 21, 2015",6,Drama
Trainwreck,"This movie had many genuinely funny moments, but it was about a half hour too long - in that extra time the plot meandered and became bloated and confused; also plenty of not so funny stuff got introduced, and all of this - which is clearly the fault of one person, the editor - watered down the humor and spoiled a film that was already suffering from the fact that its protagonist is largely an unlikeable person. Occasionally you hear someone say that having a likable protagonist is not important. They're wrong (and I suspect they are jerks who secretly identify with jerk protagonists). We care about the people we like. If we don't like the protagonist, then we don't much care what happens to her in the movie, which basically means we don't care much about the movie. That was pretty much the case here.","DEC 4, 2015",5,Drama
Trainwreck,"The trailer of Trainwreck had me believing this movie would be more humorous than actually the story of a young woman dealing with her inability to have relationships. Overall I enjoyed the message this film held, but the slapstick and humour did not work as well. Amy Schumer may face overexposure and turning off her public.","MAY 3, 2016",6,Drama
Trainwreck,"I don't know but I expected something more out of this, maybe it was good as a romantic movie, but as a comedy, it wasn't that funny, aside for some episodes with Lebron or something like that, which wasn't that important to the main plot. Main plot itself actually was quite predictable, I mean like from the start, if you have seen the trailer or read anything about the movie, you know what will happen, that's why I didn't like the movie itself that much, I mean, at least make more funny jokes and make it funnier - it was an ok movie in my opinion. Amy Schumer's acting was better than I expected though, but still, not impressed.","AUG 20, 2015",5,Drama

Trainwreck,Trainwreck is appropriately titled. Amy Schumer who works for a satirical magazine has to do an article about a sports doctor who is played by Bill Hader. Schumer's character is a women in her 30's who doesn't care much about relationships with men. Bill Hader plays her so called love interest in this boring 2 hours comedy. The only real bright spots were cameos of Lebron James and Marv Albert. Comedies seem to be going completely in the toilet lately and this is one of them.,"APR 13, 2016",5,Drama

Trainwreck,"“Trainwreck” centers on Amy Schumer’s character, also called Amy, who was taught by her father (Colin Quin) that monogamy is not realistic or normal and we next meet her 23 later when she is the male version of most leads in romantic comedies such as Jim Carey, Will Farrell and that ilk. She is rude, crude, very promiscuous and doesn’t believe in spending a whole night with any of her tricks. (I did/do identify with the latter!) Schumer also wrote the script which is basically ‘boy (Bill Hader as Aaron Conners) meets girl Hollywood cute, boy loses girl so the boy gets girl ending can happen. Whether it is due to Schumer, or the director Judd Apatow, there is a lot of male nudity, mainly full backsides, with one exceptional funny almost frontal nudity, and very little female nudity though Amy is shown in many sex scenes--almost always wearing a bra if not fully clothed. Billed as a comedy I will say the audience, consisting of equal men and women, were laughing through most of it. I smiled here and there but didn’t have a really good laugh until 1 hour and 55 minutes into the 2 hour and 2 minute movie. I was also touched in 2 scenes and shook my head in a couple of scenes that seemed to be from another movie. This is the first time I have really seen Amy Schumer and I enjoyed her performance but wondered if in real life she only wears too short skirts! I admired Bill Hader in last year’s “The Skeleton Twins” and he has a lot of chemistry with Schumer. Watching her first serious relationship, and the problems she has with it, makes for a different romantic comedy as does the leads not being pretty picture actors. Due to Hader’s profession in the movie, as a sports medicine doctor/surgeon, there are a lot of cameos by sports names plus, as usual, in any Apatow movies there are cameos by names who don’t get billing until the end credits. Of the sports figures in the movie LeBron James has more than a cameo role playing himself as a skinflint cheap, and concerned friend of the doctor, being naturally funny and has a one on one basketball scene with Hader that cracked the audience up! Also in the film is Brie Larson as Schumer’s sister who is the complete opposite in her relationship of Amy with her husband, Mike Birbiglia. John Cena’s as Amy’s dumb, muscle bound, everything he says comes out with **** connotations, current friend with benefits and Tilda Swinton as her very strange boss are welcome additions as are Randall Park and Vanessa Bayer as co-workers. Norman Llyod, a 100 year old actor who has been working since 1932, adds some humor as a resident of the old folk’s home where Amy’s father is living. Now, in the genre of “Bridesmaids” and “Spy”, “Trainwreck” furthers the reality that women can get as low as men. Is that a good thing?","JUL 17, 2015",5,Drama
Trainwreck,"The comedy is very hit-and-miss, the story wasn't too interesting as a whole and none of these characters are really that likeable or relatable, especially Amy. A few good moments but on the whole, pretty mediocre at best for me","DEC 29, 2015",5,Drama
Jurassic World Dominion,"It was nice to see the original Jurassic Park crew hang out with the Jurassic World crew. The rest of this entire movie was a pointless slog. These dinos, we’ve seen them before and better. This kind of sequel is just spinning the wheels. Some of the worst in this movie is in the casting. The villain is dressed up like Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, Inc. The thing about Tim Cook is that he is the breed of second generation CEOs that are not as controversial as the founding CEOs. All in all, a Tim Cook character makes for a boring villain. Later in the movie, we meet a dinosaur smuggler who looks like a professional model. Despite riding in her old propeller plane and trading in dusty, desert markets, this smuggler always finds time to apply full makeup. Some of the dinosaur smugglers and scientists are also unbelievably pretty. Thousands of hours were spent making the dinosaurs look real, but mere minutes were spent trying to cast the right actors. The story itself goes from dumb to dumber. The move starts with a plague of giant Cretaceous locusts destroying crops around the midwest. This is supposed to be some kind of mystery, but these locusts are the size of a cat and farm groups would be up in arms over this type of devastation. (Never mind that these giant bugs would have trouble breathing in our lower oxygen environment.) Once again, the world is oblivious to an obvious threat and only small group of plucky heroes can save the day. The dinosaur fights have become stale. You can now watch a documentary on TV that has more realistic dinosaurs and dinosaur encounters. The dinosaurs all helpfully pause to roar before lunging at our plucky heroes. And of course no one seems to understand that dinosaurs are not bullet proof. (Jurassic World 4: Bullet Proof Dinos). I really could not stand how cliche this move is. From the mustache twirling villain to the dinosaur fights to the breakdown of the security that protects humans from dinosaurs. I hit fast forward through quite a bit of this middling effort. Writing matters. Details matter. A few Oscar winning actors will not save a movie. I hope this film series is now extinct.","MAY 28, 2023",4,Thriller
Jurassic World Dominion,"NOSTALGIA TIME! A long back then, who never felt the dinosaur hype? This movie clearly to lit our nostalgic memories about that hype! All the cast from the old movies to the latest movies are perfectly aligned in this movie. Also, rumors said this is the last movie for Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard to be cast. There are 2 main plots: a) the special kid of brilliant dinosaurs scientist, Maisie Lockwood accidentally hunted down coz she have special DNA; and b) Biosyn company that secretly develops illegal research about dinosaurs, their crop product, and gonna create unintentional global disaster. Ofc, both plots brought us to all the old cast and the new cast. Nostalgia seems vividly can be felt. The screenplay looks like purposively creates nostalgia, especially the scene and the moment. The great cast also supports the greatness of this movie blockbuster. They are well-performed to give specific char personality. However, the main cons are the ordinary storyline. Nothin great or amusing enough. Thrillin sensation or emotional moment? Nah-uh! Besides, every char seems just standard quality or nothing prominent enough. Maybe because they're trying to be fair to give equal screen time for a lot of great actors. Nevertheless, the visuals and music are just fine. In conclusion, it's a good movie to lit our nostalgia for dinosaur phenomenon. It makes us more soothed as if we've passed a long-life journey coz we barely realized how long have been passed since the 1st movie of these came to us. Watch it or missed it, nothin' special but it is still good. 6/10","OCT 6, 2022",6,Thriller

The CGI of the dinosaurs were actually great, that's one positivity I can give for this movie and also Jeff Goldblum out did himself in this movie. Other than that the movie was everywhere, some parts didn't make sense, you got some new evil characters in the movie that only appeared in the movie for a few minutes and have no other part in the movie after that. And this whole ""evil corporation"" taking over the world is getting tiresome, I can't keep up with all these different evil corporations through out the series. It's like who are these people? How are they tied into the original movies? And why should we care about them? It's very confusing. Oh and the clone daughter, yeah had no idea who the mom is, apparently she was one of the biggest and skilled scientist in the first movie, but she was never mentioned in the first movie at all. Like why? Why was she some part of an important piece in the first Jurassic Park movie, if she was never mentioned? I don't know... my son was very invested in the movie being a big dinosaur fan, makes me happy to see he's enjoying it. As for me I would rather watch something else. Again it's an okay movie, got cool parts here and there. But the original Jurassic Park movies 1 through 3, is the best in my book. The first Jurassic World (aired in 2015) movie was great but after that it just started to get boring. So this is an average 6/10 rating for me.","JUL 5, 2022",6,Thriller

Though it was fun to see the classic characters and a couple good new ones, it was just strange storytelling that didn’t work at all. I was bored even when the intense action scenes came along, partly because of the bad storytelling, but also because the action scenes themselves had a strange removed quality to them with endless ridiculous and extreme occurrences with no stakes or sense of peril to the main characters. The whole movie felt like a big mess.

A couple of dinosaurs were let loose and raptors suddenly look how they are supposed to ? There’s a little too many heroes and it never felt like any were in danger. The movie needed more villains with guns to be eaten. With that said it was nice to see the Jurassic Park characters team with the Jurassic World characters.

There is a chase scene in this movie where you are invested completely... the sound pulls you in and all speakers fire on all cylinders. The music is cut out to deepen the action in the scene. Then there are a few small jump scares here and there which i felt was a nice touch. The film also jumps to multiple locations. The actors where also doing their part in giving it their best. Old cast members return. We also get to see NEW Dinos. Now some negatives: - I feel the Action was limited and there is a section in the movie where the movie comes to a slow crawl. - Sadly, MUCH more could've been done with the story. - 1 girl means everything in this film not the Dinos. - We need to see More Dinos. - There is always 1 bad guy running the show...

The film-making tools used in this film show a knowledge of the curriculum, but just using every trick in the text-book does not a great film make. Sometimes restraint is required, and that is exactly what I wish this movie would have done, to lay off for a second or two to late me catch my breath. There were some great moments with Bryce Dallas Howard swimming through a pond covered in duckweed and Chris Pratt being chased not by motorbikes but by velociraptors in Malta in Bond-esque fashion. The Dinosaurs spring up every chance they get which is exciting at first but the novelty quickly wears off. A new live-action dinosaur appears every two minutes and packed in back to back like sardines and characters stare at them stunned like they were still seeing them for the first time. I know if it was me all I would be thinking, 'it's just another animatronic dinosaur, nothing to see here'. If the dinosaurs were fewer and further between when they came on screen their presence would be impactful however what can you do when you've let them all out. At the end of the day less is more and that's no less true with Jurassic World Dominion. It might leave you motion sick and queasy but it is a rollercoaster ride nonetheless. They stretched the formula as far as it could possibly go (and sometimes further) and I for one am relieved its all over. Time for some long earned rest for the franchise.","JUL 19, 2022",6,Thriller

Ima be real here, the movie wasn't terrible, it's watchable, and you can watch it again without feeling like your skin is peeling off. However, that doesn't change the fact that this movie was so mediocre. I'm only going to be focusing on the plot because the visuals are really good, but that's for like all the Jurassic World Movies, so it really doesn't matter. Now the plot itself has its bad moments. I think a perfect example is the oversized bugs. Why does this exist? Like really you could've made it anything else to even FIT the dinosaur storyline, but you chose bugs so they can rig the food system. How does this have to do anything with Jurassic World? This story plot itself takes down the movie so badly and puts a bad taste in your mouth. Everything else in the movie is alright, like stealing the young kid, which felt interesting for the most part, liked that they gave her more character, as I felt that was kind of lacking in the movie. Also, another problem I have with this movie is that it takes more of the approach of it being dinosaurs that are affected by humans, rather than the more interesting plot of dinosaurs affecting humans. Sure in the Fallen Kingdom they were released into the wild, but the movie did such a piss poor job of making them sound intense.

Life found a way blah blah blah"" but its really only like that for one scene. The rest of the film theyre like trapped in this forest preserve and have to stop these giant mutated locusts from taking over. The plot itself is a jumbled mess, I can sort of understand that they had ALOT of difficulties filming this movie because of COVID restrictions and they probably had to make a ton of changes to things to adapt to the conditions. The positives are the dinos, they look fantastic and they're really doing fine work making these things look as real as possible. The legacy characters are fantastic even though Alan Grant is mostly playing second to Ellie Satler and Ian Malcolm is kinda there but he contributes more towards the end of the film. Bryce Dallas Howard's character is given the most development from the new characters, she's easily improved the most since the first one. My favorite new character is actually Kayla Watts, portayed by DeWanda Wise. Wise does a great job in bringing a likable and badass side character that offers some laughs too.

They opened it up for a sequel, and this will make mega bucks. The close practical effects for the dinosaurs were fantastic. The writing for main plot was not interesting at all due to building off from the last film, making the twist into a full fleshed story with lore ect.. then again these last 3 films were nothing but entertaining dinosaur movies. Great popcorn fun. If you're turned off by the plot then the dinosaur segments are worth the price of the admission alone. The original cast's characters were treated with respect following the trend of Ghostbusters, Maverick ect.. unlike Star Wars 7-9..

Trainwreck,Trainwreck is an unfunny movie with a very generic romcom plot. It lacks the daring that made Schumer's TV show funny.,"OCT 14, 2020",2,Drama
Trainwreck,It's amazing how stupid the plot of this movie is. A lost girl who behaves like a jerk (the why being explained by the funniest scene of the movie with the father) falls miraculously in love with a doctor who is : - rich - nice - patient - single - knows celebrities - has big male parts - fit and handsome. And she decides to hold on to him. Yeah ok. Did the writers realise how much what they wrote is a big joke ? Did the producers ? Did the actors ? As for the rest it is uptight boring Apatow movie for uptight boring people who live in their New York bubble and affiliated.,"OCT 31, 2015",3,Drama
Trainwreck,"While the cast is amazing except Amy Schumer, the film is nothing but worse than mediocre. And even god awful in plenty of moments. Through the story it felt like I'm watching her ego ****. It was a painful experience.","SEP 22, 2019",0,Drama
Trainwreck,"Amy Schumer was A-mazing!! She is brilliant... brilliant expressions, reactions, etc... This movie, however, ****. It was wayyyy too long and it had the same ridiculous plot that you've seen in cheesy b-movies for decades. Girl afraid to commit, falls in love, pushes guy away, big happy revelation at the end. In between it all... was a lot of nonsense. Again, typical bad comedy crap. The best part of the movie was Amy's performance. She was great... this movie was not. Totally disappointed. Shocked by the favorable reviews the flick received.","JUL 19, 2015",1,Drama

Trainwreck,"Not sure how this garnished a 75.....really makes me doubt Metacritc ratings....I'd give it a solid 20 at best, and that is pushing it. I do love Amy Schumer, but this movie really really stinks","AUG 8, 2015",2,Drama
Trainwreck,"TrainWreck - What an appropriate title. I felt I needed a shower after watching it. Guys, while each of us should occasionally take our spouse or significant other to a chick flick, this is one to avoid at all costs. I don't care how much LeBron or other athletes are featured, this is one disgusting trainwreck of a movie. It was just not funny... You could hear short bursts of supportive (I guess Amy Scheuer fans) laughter from the same pockets of women in the audience. I realize it was a chick-flick, and I was definitely taking one for the team, but I would have sat through 10 hours of ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" before seeing this disaster again... As you watch Amy Schumer and each of her conquests, one just can't help but think that each of these guys would fall head over heels over her, especially when the character she plays would be human petri dish of bacteria and viruses...","JUL 18, 2015",0,Drama
Trainwreck,"After all the good critics and seeing a couple of good comedians I was expecting a good movie, sadly I end up watching a predictable story with story telling problems, couple of fun jokes and lot of bad ones. Too predictable, too generic and with too many flaws, an extra point because I love Bill Harder.","JUL 24, 2016",3,Drama
Trainwreck,"I expected this movie to be interesting and funny considering all of the hype around it. Unfortunately, the movie was rather boring and frankly disgusting. I am not an easy disgusted person, but really, how many lewd sex jokes can you fit into a movie? This brand of comedy isn't for me, I guess. I just wish that the overall movie had been interesting so I could have something to follow along with between the non-existent laughs. It just felt that the movie tried so hard to shock me, but really it fell flat on its face. Maybe it could shock my 70 year old grandmother....","JAN 19, 2016",1,Drama
Trainwreck,"Honestly, I never had heard of Amy, but my girlfriend really wanted to see this film so we went. Right off the bat, it was apparent that the crowd at the movie was made up of big fans of her's. Most people laughed at EVERYTHING she said, at all times. I thought it was really strange, like I was in a psychology experiment. Anyway, the movie was terrible in my opinion, and was just a girl version of a raunchy comedy made for guys. There was a scene with a famous sportscaster that made me cringe harder than anything in a film ever has before, it was just SO terrible. Also, it felt like I was watching this thing prattle on for 4 hours. Skip it.","JUL 22, 2015",1,Drama
Trainwreck,"This movie was actually boring and annoying and mostly not at all funny.. Amy may be ""hot"" right now, but she can't act at all. It appears that she is capable of only a single expression on her face. I really wanted to like this movie, but it wasn't possible. Also, the gratuitous ""humping"" was about 3 humps too long. Not that I don't like male posteriors, but how many do we need to see to get the point that she is promiscuous. LeBron and Tilda did fine jobs and were the highlights of the movie. As a comparison, I thought Ted2 was hilarious!","JUL 21, 2015",2,Drama

Trainwreck,"Trainwreck is quite a fitting title for this film. When it's not bad, it's bland, and when it's not bland, it's wincingly cringey. Definitely not a good comedy, and way, way too long of a runtime for what it is trying to do. You will suffer through these two hours.","OCT 20, 2017",3,Drama
Trainwreck,"Never has a movie title written my review for me. Today is that day and this is that movie. If you love CareerGrrrrrl Comedy with a dose of Bill Hader (who btw is pretty good in this role, a little like Ferrell was good in Old School), then this is your movie. For Me? The combination of Apatow, Schumer, and the rest of them are a waste of time and money. Apatow is a cliche of himself at this point and Schumer just wrote a movie as a vehicle for her raunchy comedy; which has about 2 min left of her 15. One day we'll look back at these movie making charlatans for what they are: zeitgeist deluded has-beens who tricked us all into thinking they were actually funny and not just show-biz lottery winners. The DVD is future coaster material.","AUG 24, 2015",0,Drama
Trainwreck,"o k, this is not the worst movie i've ever seen, but that doesn't stop it from being a total waste of time. simply put, there is nothing remarkable about this film. Eddie Murphey launched his film career with 48 hours - a film i laughed all the way through. Amy launched hers with this ""trainwreck"" of a movie, supposedly a comedy, which i did not laugh once at. trainwreck is not only it's title, but it's rating as a film too.","JAN 23, 2016",2,Drama
Trainwreck,"What a revolting sleazy little film. So gross. So tasteless. So **** all of it carefully packaged in an aggressively “How dare you not find this hip"" ........ Not so much a film as a kind of desperate ""commodity"" for desperate times, like a series of really bad Saturday Night Live “zany” sketches at their ham-fisted, bottom-feeding worst. I walked **** needs this garbage !","JUL 20, 2015",0,Drama
Trainwreck,"In addition to a tiring overload of 'F' bombs in the first 30 min (I lost count), this movie lacks laugh-out-loud moments and believable romance. Maybe because white trash drunks are boring in real life, I found Amy Schumer's character more sad and boring than funny or interesting to watch. Bill Hader's comedic talents are not present in this movie, and his ""doctor"" character goes rapidly from his own boredom with Amy's character to being suddenly and inexplicably ( within minutes) ready to go out for dinner and a drink with her. There's no believable transition into this romance. Poor, sad Amy just didn't have a sports doctor to show her how great life really is? Unh-hunh. okay. We didn't make it through the whole thing....fell asleep as soon as Bill and Amy went out for their first drink.","JUL 24, 2016",2,Drama

Jurassic World Dominion,"The whole movie didn't make any sense. The plot was asinine from the start. Characters motivations were off the charts stupid (like how many people kept forgetting they had guns and would just run away from the raptors instead). I am so sick of Chris Platt holding his hand up. Even the visual effects, usually a strong point of this franchise, didn't look good at all. The dinosaurs movements looked clunky and weird. The leads were clearly just doing this for a paycheck. It's not even fun as a dumb dino movie. This movie really could have used like 100 more dinosaurs to make it interesting. Overall don't waste your time.","JUL 20, 2022",0,Thriller
Jurassic World Dominion,"This movie is such a big letdown. There were barely any dinosaur scenes, the plot is pretty much just scientists and paleontologists trying to stop the production of apocalyptic locusts from eating the world's food source and they just called it ""Jurassic World Dominion"".","JUL 27, 2022",3,Thriller
Jurassic World Dominion,"Oh boy, this entry in the series is not good. It looks absolutely amazing, I have never seen so detailed creature effects, the landscapes are stunning, the cinematography is extremely good, the sound effects are awesome.

If you are the sort who is OK turning your brain completely off and just watching an endless chase scene with dinosaurs, you'll like this. The characters are awful. The plot is impossible to follow. The cast keeps growing ever larger. The stakes are unclear. The chases never end. It ****. It gets a 2 from me because it is indeed a movie. And it does look nice at times.

Most of the newer characters do nothing, and decent performances from the old cast are wasted. The action picks up in the second half, compared to the first half which is insanely boring for a Jurrasic Park movie. But even then, I would say most of the action scenes are forgettable. This and Fallen Kingdom are easily the worst Jurrasic Park movies.","SEP 29, 2022",3,Thriller

If any of the characters died, I wouldn't have cared less, as I wasn't attached to them. The characters, like the film overall had no personality, or charm. There was literally nothing to like at all. I was quite young when I watched the first one at the cinema and it was servicable, nothing special but alright. Worth a watch.

Jurassic World Dominion,"""Jurassic World Dominion"" (theatres, PG-13, 2.5 hrs) should've been an awesome adventure-drama and it had the outstanding VFX to get there but the director and writers just whiffed on this. Totally implausible get aways from situations and dino-attax just took all the suspense/realism from this. Our protags were never, ever in any danger when their threats are simply written to be cartoonishly impotent. I mean a plane crash at 200-mph into snow/ice and our protags have no broken bones, no concussions, no **** or scratches even! Totally written by and for 10 year olds. And the ridiculous amount of close-ups on Bryce D H, is the director in love with her or what?! Jeebus. Anyway, such a disappointingly wasted opportunity.","SEP 10, 2022",3,Thriller

Jurassic World Dominion is one such movie. A prime example of pure hackery, this latest dreck brought to us by Colin Trevorrow isn't just the worst Jurassic Park movie, this is one of the worst studio franchise films ever made. A movie that is so aggressively dumb you can feel your brain cells slowly evaporating with each new asinine development that occurs throughout its excruciating 2-and-a-half hour runtime.","JUL 27, 2023",2,Thriller

Jurassic World Dominion,"I really tried to like Dominion but it fell flat on its face. After 45 minutes I was already hoping it would be over soon. Dominion is a far cry from the Jurassic Parks that many of us grew up with. Owen and Claire’s relationship is awkward at best and Alan and Ellie’s relationship felt like fan service gone wrong. Dominion focuses on in-your-face action more than it’s predecessors which makes it feel more like a generic action movie. Unfortunately the subtle visuals and sounds used to create moments of dread in past films is missing completely. The massive dinosaur fights even felt identical to fights from the past 5 films. Also, what’s up with everyone being able to hold off dinosaurs by holding up their hand? Owen was only able to do this with the raptor he raised from birth. It makes no sense that any other characters can suddenly make the dinosaurs obey them. This choice removes any sense of risk and danger as we know the protagonists can use this magic hand trick to deal with most smaller dinos. At one point we see a Velociraptor show up (one of the most terrifying creatures from past film) and I didn’t even feel worried for our protagonist because they can all take dinosaurs now. The only reason I’m not rating this lower is because the short scenes showing mosques adapting to our world were really interesting. It’s truly disappointing to see so much wasted potential with the combination of the new and old cast.","SEP 6, 2022",3,Thriller
