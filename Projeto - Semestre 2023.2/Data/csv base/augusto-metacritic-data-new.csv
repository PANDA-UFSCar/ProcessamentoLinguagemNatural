Arrival,Denis villeneuve shows us all his talent in this film which is for me his best : science fiction is used in the best way. I have rarely been so taken by the mystery of a film during my first cinema session.,"OCT 3, 2022",10,Mistery
Arrival,"Amy Adams gives a superb performance in what could be called ""Independence Day with a Brain."" Denis Villeneuve delivers an intentional methodically paced script with the sort of intelligence, nuance, and confidence that feels wholly refreshing.","MAR 7, 2022",10,Mistery
Arrival,"This movie is not for everyone. If you wanted a science fiction action blockbuster then you will be disappointed. However it is one of the most brilliant plots in scifi. I won’t spoil the details but once you understand the twist it’s just magnificent. It is a movie worth to discuss with friends and very memorable because it does something completely different. The ideas for follow up stories are basically endless. It is based on the book “The story of her life” if I am correct. Also all actors were the right choices for their respected rolls. I think this will be a forgotten masterpiece because it is not mainstream enough. Sorry for not going in in details, but it will ruin the movie. Think about the twist in “The sixth sense”. If someone spoiled it for you the movie would be less good (or a lesser experience?).","DEC 6, 2019",10,Mistery
Arrival,"Arrival is one of my favorite Sci Fi movies of all time. The movie doesn't need flashy action sequences or superficial Drama to deliver a thoughtful and emotional experience. Even the ""plot twist"" if you may call it that is in clear service of the story and not just a plot twist for the sake of it. Arrival manages to connect with me every time I watch it. I think this is some of the best that Sci Fi has to offer.","APR 3, 2020",10,Mistery
Arrival,"I don't think this movie is about that ""what makes us human"". Personally I think it is about creating your own reality. The whole movie developes around the ability of a character to understand a language. In a way, Adams' character is a child (humanity) learning to speak. She has to go through all the tribulations of learning a new language, a powerful one at that. The premise is quite interesting and it took me two views to get it: Your language (the way you express what you think) determines your reality. They even mention it at the beginning of the movie, with the Sapir-Whorf theory. This is by far a very metaphysical proposal, and a very adecuate one at that, one that has been told to us by great master of ancient (""For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned""). In a way, language IS reality, it is the only way we have to describe it and thus create it. So it would make sense that a more powerful language would create a different, more powerful reality. In the movie, learning the aliens' language would opne the doors of time and space for you, and this can be wither a weapon (as first understood by humans) or a gift, as later realized by Adams. Of course the ability to thread between past, present and future could be a powerful weapon, or a great gift. Once she realizes this, it is quite interesting that she still chooses to have her baby, aware of the outcome, but the most important choice she makes, while having the ability to visit the past or future, is to live in the present. Powerful message indeed. So now you know, choose your words carefully.","MAR 2, 2020",8,Mistery
Arrival,"Arrival is a sci-fi film only in presentation, as the film explores deeper themes of human communication and aggressiveness. While Arrival’s initial presentation may seem jarring and somewhat flawed, as the movie progresses and the twist is revealed, the editing choices and the pseudo-confusing sequencing end up contributing to the movie's meaning as a larger whole. Arrival explores various linguistic and psychological theories and takes them to an extreme, even using them as the crux for its storytelling. While it does benefit the viewer to be familiar with psychological concepts, especially linguistic determinism, the film does a good job explaining the fundamental concepts the story is based upon. Arrival is not only a cautionary tale but also a hopeful one. Arrival purports that through cooperation and coordination, i.e. through avoiding competition, a future which benefits more to a greater degree can be achieved. In this way, Arrival is a greatly anti-capitalist film presented in a widely digestible way. Villeneuve is a highly-skilled director, and, with Arrival, he shows that he can blend genres and excel while doing it.","MAY 2, 2020",9,Mistery

Arrival,One of the best sci-fy films. One of the best and innovative directors. Predictable result.,"OCT 21, 2021",10,Mistery
Arrival,"This is quite an eery film - I felt it seemed almost more like a documentary than a sci-fi drama film at one point, with a narrator explaining to the viewer what had been learnt about the mysterious new beings from outer space who have apparently taken up residence in a number of locations on Earth. I liked the nostalgic flashbacks shown, a reminder of childrens curiosity and wonder when faced with seeing certain things for the first time. Its a relatively atmospheric film, with looming music used in the background, not dissimilar to that present in other previous sci-fi films, most notably Close Encounters of the Third Kind. It also reminded me somewhat of Jodie Foster in the film Contact from the 1990s. Its a somewhat deep film that makes you think about how threats are handled, at a global level, the responses by various governments and the like. If anything, I found it refreshing that in this instance, the US didn't exactly go in 'all guns blazing' and I appreciated that the main character, Louise Banks, tries very hard to understand and see things from the unknowns' point of view. I don't think I can say much more but suffice to say, I recommend this film.","NOV 20, 2021",8,Mistery
Arrival,"The most intelligent film ever. The best Sci-Fi film ever. The best film of Denis Villeneuve. It's the best multisensorial experience; how script, directing, cinematography, editing, sound, production design, visual effects and performances strike a great balance one each other to breakthrough a new way to watch and understand the pass time.","DEC 12, 2021",10,Mistery
Arrival,"Really amazing movie with great visuals,the characters in the movie were described beautifully and intelligently. Arrival in my opinion did everything right what other alien invasion movie ruins,it is a perfect response to bad movies","APR 18, 2020",9,Mistery
Arrival,"One of 2016 finest movies. Though provoking and clever movie that showcases the acting talents of Adams as well as arguably the brightest and most consistent director in Hollywood, Denis Villeneuve.","JAN 5, 2021",9,Mistery
Arrival,"Phenomenal movie. I wouldn't have watched this movie if I hadnt known about the intriguing ending (yes I was spoiled but I don't mind). I've never been a fan of Amy Adams in Superman or Jeremy Renner in Marvel but the story, delivery and slow pacing really punches this movie high. I wasn't disappointed at all. It has never a dull moment and there are many parts I can rewatch many times just to think about how they unfold. Lots of small details to look out for too like Abbot's actions before something happens. This movie is right up there with District 9, Contact, The Martian and Interstellar.","DEC 27, 2019",9,Mistery
Arrival,"Twelve black, shell-like spaceships land in twelve different locations around the world. The American government, in the person of Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker), sends the linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and the mathematician/physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) to find out what the aliens want. The other nations have a different plan and it is important to keep the peace. Arrival is a great science fiction film with the theme: landing of aliens. Treated differently than most blockbuster films. In most films, the objects are immediately shot at and the aliens attack. At Arrival everyone acts rationally and wants to find out what kind of objects they are and what the residents want. As a viewer, you think about what it could be and whether the residents are evil. What the film does particularly well is the visual implementation and the sound. The aliens look scary and could be from a horror movie. The tension is well maintained and it never gets boring. The beginning of the film is very emotional, which I didn't expect. The way they try to communicate is very interesting and well done and everyone tries to interpret something for themselves. I guessed some of the film's twist, but I was still shocked and didn't expect some things. The ending, like the beginning, is very emotional and beautiful. Ian's character isn't highlighted much, the film focuses more on Louise, whereas Ian seems to just be there to make the ending work. 9/10","APR 26, 2023",9,Mistery
Arrival,"The best thriller/sci-fi film I have ever seen in my life. The work behind the camera by Denis Villeneuve is majestic. The concept behind the origin and the meaning of the ""aliens"" is absolutely original in every shape. The work made by Joe Walker in the sound editing with the beautiful shots made by Brandon Young gave that little touch to the film to make it feel smoother.","APR 8, 2020",10,Mistery
Arrival,"At half way through the movie it felt terribly boring and it was like just the quest to find the signs of aliens but that ending changed my opinion suddenly it went to the peak!Awesome score since start of the film i was too much into the music awesome score,acting.most of time it felt boring even though the suspense of whats aliens try to tell and ending makes it a good movie!","APR 1, 2020",7,Mistery
Arrival,"This film just struck a chord with me, it felt so profound, minimalistic but very emotional. The score is a masterpiece and deserves as much praise, if not more, than the movie itself.","NOV 9, 2022",10,Mistery
Arrival,This film is one of the most original with this theme. There could be an easy continuation. And really think about what the world would be like if there was just one language,"FEB 24, 2023",9,Mistery
Arrival,"If you want to write an emotional sci-fi, you won't get it any better than Denis Villenueve's Arrival. The acting, subtlety in the editing and directing and originality in the script come together to create a complete masterpiece. I genuinely think it has one of the greatest twists of all time.","JAN 10, 2021",10,Mistery

Arrival,I finally got around to seeing this one and I am so glad I did! An interesting premise and cerebral plot more focused on language and geopolitical relations than the aliens themselves. The movie also respects the science that it dives into and doesn't use it as a simple plot contrivance like many action sci-fi movies do. I was left with a feeling of hope and intrigue after finishing it.,"MAY 31, 2020",10,Mistery
Arrival,Awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"SEP 4, 2022",10,Mistery
Arrival,"A much duller version of close encounters of the third kind. Lots of sitting around discussing things and not much else going on. I found the main character too self absorbed to be likable so I couldn't get invested in her. The whole thing was very self-important but the payoff wasn't worth it. It shares the same faults as Denis Villeneuve's other movies, such as blade runner 2049 and Dune - visually striking imagery and great soundtrack but the movie is ultimately long and dull.","JAN 9, 2023",7,Mistery
Arrival,"What humanity needs is to strive for a common goal. I love science fiction because it can paint somewhat realistic scenarios like ARRIVAL, in which our planet is saved by extraterrestrial intervention. But more real than our first alien contact is the way ARRIVAL depicts a planet divided by invisible borders and nations unwilling to cooperate. God I love this movie.","MAR 25, 2019",9,Mistery
Arrival,"Arrival is a modern Sci-Fi. Both in the good and in the bad sense of the word. Arrival is spectacular and beautiful to attract a large audience, and moderately stupid not to scare away the mass audience. Excellent cast, one of the best roles of Amy Adams. Arrival should be watched only in the original, Arrival about linguistics, so dubbing completely changes the idea of the film. Arrival is a vivid example of popularizing Sci-Fi in wide circles, but only because it is a bad example of the genre. Arrival is too simple and stupid. If you want a real Sci-Fi, watch Annihilation. Of course, the Arrival movie is not worse, and it looks even better for most people, but when they say that this is one of the best Sci-Fi about exploring extraterrestrial life, you catch only irritation.","JUN 10, 2023",9,Mistery
Arrival,"Arrival is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made. Everything from Amy Adams'performance to the design of the ships, the aliens, the concept of the time, and how we perceive it, is extraordinary. Denis Villeneuve is a genius.","FEB 12, 2022",10,Mistery
Arrival,"Not great. As others have said, it is slow. Also, it feels like they just did a wikipedia search for ""linguistics"" and then wrote a script around the first paragraph. I don't see this as a cerebral sci fi film at all. More of a cheesy, slog-fest.","NOV 12, 2016",5,Mistery
Arrival,"I went to see this because when I arrived at the theatre Arrival was the only movie that just started. I liked Jeremy Renner in other movies like The Town, so I thought I would watch this one. I was pretty disappointed and could not give more than a 6. It seems he did not get enough acting in and even looked quiet at times like his lines were cut out. I don't see him in a romantic role either and the music was too overwhelming for me. It is an interesting idea but I don't believe the writing was really there, her flashbacks were predictable, and you knew what was going to happen. One of those films basically you know as the ones that rely on the CGI to get the ticket sales which is a losing concept to me.","NOV 15, 2016",6,Mistery
Arrival,"This is a science fiction movie about aliens visiting our planet. Or rather about attempts the mankind takes trying to establish a contact with aliens. The movie is done quite professionally, and I liked it's cinematography and sound track. There are good actors starring there (Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Forest Whitaker), and they deliver adequate performance. Most of the movie kept me interested. Sometimes pseudo-philosophical lingo carried me away. I think the movie was too long, and the script has not been thought through, leading to nowhere. Which is a shame, it had a lot of potential.","NOV 13, 2016",5,Mistery
Arrival,"The movie is very aesthetically pleasing to look at. There are a lot of great visual set pieces here. But as far as that, the movie never really transforms into anything more than a slice of life. Yes, the woman knows what'll happen in the next few years by the end of the movie, but what does she say to the guy that would happen to? The moral of the story is to live life even if it means going through heartbreak, but if feels hollow as it all felt avoidable to a degree and yet also in some ways makes the inevitability of the situation even worse. It's hard to say without spoiling, but it's decent to below average (a 6 rather than a 7). The soundtrack is probably the only other above average thing about this movie, though, very etherial and melancholy. God rest the soul of the composer.","MAY 13, 2021",6,Mistery

Arrival,Being a sci-fi buff I was anxious to see this film. It was not all I hoped it would be. Repeated scenes over & over lost the interest of the audience as I could feel. The acting was average and the sub plot was difficult to follow. Just couldn't rate it as some have.,"NOV 15, 2016",5,Mistery
Arrival,"Lets starts honest I really liked Arrival. Until it turned weird. Then, not so much anymore. With a class A cast including Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker this should have been a great movie all the way to the end. Except that it wasn’t. It was a great movie until it stopped being that. I had high hopes for it and as such I was left slightly disappointed. Arrival is a good story with a ton of potential for greatness until it got whacked on the head and it all went belly up. For some reason I can’t help comparing it to the 1997 movie Contact, starring the iconic Jodie Foster, which kind of had the same problem. Great movie with a great story until the moment it went all pear shaped. The Story Twelve pods of unknown makeup and origin have appeared overnight at seemingly random locations around the globe. As to be expected the media goes nuts and social services break down. School is out. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is a successful linguistics professor who stands in from of an empty class room the next day. She highly regarded in her field and has done highly classified consultancy work for the government in the past. Because of this it comes as no big surprise when she gets approached by the military. They need her help in decoding the language of the aliens and once that is done they want her to establish communications with the visitors. For this mission she gets a team of people and works closely together with Ian Donnelly, a theoretical physicist, portrayed by Jeremy Renner. All twelve pods have positioned themselves at seemingly arbitrary coordinates all over the world. The local governments are scrambling to establish contact with the aliens and try to learn as much as they can about ‘their’ pods. They all have a fall out about how to proceed and one by one they end up shutting down communication with the rest of the world. Everyone is now acting isolated without knowing what the others are doing or how far they are with their work to decipher the purpose of the visit. This of course creates an explosive situation that threatens to get out of hand when gossip has it that the Chinese are contemplating to nuke their pod in search for answers. This of course is not an ideal situation for anyone, as no one knows if and how the aliens or the neighbours, for that matter, will retaliate. Here is where it went wrong In between her work Louise has these strange flashbacks to her family, mainly her daughter. Except that we learn she doesn’t have a family nor a daughter. These flashbacks are just that, but that the events have not actually happened yet. They will happen in the future. And that, because she now speaks the aliens language, time doesn’t follow in a straight line for her anymore but in parallel strings all mixed up. Say what? This is where is turned south for me. I am good with weird and strange. But that was too much for me. In that moment the movie lost its credibility in my eyes. I know there are concepts out there about time and space and astro physics. In fact I am very interest in the subject. I have read several read books and listened to countless podcasts about it. But the way it was done in the movie is just ridiculous. I am very sorry. Final thoughts I suppose we can draw similarities to todays society, which is rather trigger happy. We constantly on the cusp **** catastrophe even without the presence of aliens. This raises the question of what will it take for humankind to step back from the abyss. What is needed for people to start working together instead of against each other? Arrival also touches on another question. A moral one that people ask themselves daily. If you knew the future and the way your life would turn out to be, would you change anything? If you knew that by accepting the greatest gift and joy you would ever get, you would also set yourself up the the most desperate pain. Would you still chose the same path? Its a powerful message. I just wish they would have found a different way to convey it.","DEC 25, 2016",5,Mistery
Arrival,"Cheap time travel as memory tricks doomed this only passing scifi flick with trite explanations, ignoring gaping logic holes dealing with the two main characters. I wouldn't recommend this movie. Style (& not all that much of that) over substance.","JAN 19, 2017",4,Mistery
Arrival,"Definitely a case of the emperor's new clothes, this film isn't as clever as it thinks it is. To be fair though it seems to have convinced a large number of people that it is. The longer it goes on the more the story and more importantly logic starts to unravel. As for the ending, meh just psychobabble.","MAY 24, 2020",4,Mistery
Arrival,"Can I be honest? This movie doesn't have any sense? What ""precious"" message aliens have for the Humanity? after half hour I completely lost interest watching the movie that was turning into a no sense plot. After Indipendece day any other Sci-Fi movies has been able to be plausible (for what possible), exciting and with a simple as much as deep story. Disappointed","NOV 12, 2016",5,Mistery
Arrival,"This could have been a great movie but the plot holes were large enough to drive a truck through and the premise is a bit hard to swallow. So there's a written language that induces clairvoyance. Sounds stupid when saying it out loud , right. So if the whole point was to teach us this written language, why didn't they start with that? Why was it Amy Adams who starts trying to communicate through writing? If they can see the future, why do they let one of themselves die? Forgetting the phone call to the Chinese general, a major plot point? Also, the twist is a bit predicable, not horribly, but you can guess it before the reveal. Poor execution has really detracted from this movie. If you're going to make a film, do it properly!","DEC 4, 2016",6,Mistery
Arrival,"On the one hand, yet another damn flick about aliens coming down! On the other, one that is fairly restrained, intelligent and serious with an original thought provoking premise. The slow unraveling mystery is good. The conventions of the sub-genre that still aren't transcended here are not, nor is some of the sentimentality. Alas it is not that bold after all. Would a real scientist constantly dealing in mathematics and numbers upon reading .083 say, ""point oh eight three"" and not ""point zero eight three""? If he is played by a sloppy actor taking sloppy direction perhaps. Or such a real scientist saying oh instead of zero might just need to be fired and lose grants.","NOV 25, 2016",6,Mistery
Arrival,"As if realistic alien contact is not difficult enough on its own to depict, Arrival also tries to incorporate ""time travel"", hence doubling-down on its failure to portray a convincing sci-fi narrative. Beyond the fresh but failed attempt with the linguistic aspect, this film is far below Contact in every regard, and only a truly numb mind can look beyond the glaring illogicalities and senseless plot. To be more specific and to name some key points: aliens come to the planet physically but do absolutely nothing? Anthropocentric madness. Time travel into the past without addressing the paradox? Americans being the only ""good guys"" of the human race? A pathetic accidental misunderstanding of a common word (in English) being the plot device that results in the culmination? Mediocre acting and a pointless plot for a very forgettable film that, I'm sure ""fans"" don't even recall anymore. Watch the Contact instead.","JUL 3, 2019",6,Mistery
Arrival,"I don't mind that the film is slow. 2001 is a slow movie and I love every frame of it. This movie is boring at times. I looked at my watch a couple of times. I don't believe we could decipher the complex symbols as quickly as they did, and I always have to wonder why super intelligent beings have a hard time learning our language(s). I also felt ZERO chemistry between the two leads. I also thought about the movie ""Contact"" several times as there is too many similarities.

While there's lots of enticing set up, the proceedings move slowly to a repetitive and frustrating crawl before it's over. To make matters worse, the ending may leave you flummoxed.

You become invested in it and really want to know what it's about but it falls short on the delivery. Spoiler ahead. The movie delivers nothing. It's completely pointless. It tries to tell us that humanity need to work together and communicate. Well ok, thanks i guess. And some mumbo jumbo about love and children. All delivered with pretentious flashbacks and more dreary violins to force emotions upon you. All the setup is great. But in the end it doesnt deliver anything at all.

I could, if I wanted (I won't) ""spoil"" this movie for you in about two sentences, as that's all there is in terms of content.

Similar thing here, ""Arrival"" is a love story masking as an alien contact story. I want to rate it a ""1"" because of its deceit, implausible plot points, and feel-yourself-age pacing but it gets a ""3"" because of its production values and A-list cast. It also messes with the flow of time, not time travel, but its sequencing. While that's laudable, it can be very confusing and inevitably leaves you feeling ""had"" or conned story-wise.

Arrival,"My review talks about the movie so I guess it is a spolier: I have never felt the need to review a movie before. Some I really liked, some I disliked. I am a movie person. I love them. Haven watched thousands of movies in my life. I was super excited to see this movie, but had to wait until it came to video. The premise of the movie is that Aliens come to earth to share their language because somehow that gives you the ability to see into the future....sorry they lost me right there. Soo many plot holes. What do the ships do when they get someone to learn their language? Of that's right they simply fade away. That is really it. I know their is a theory out there about being able to see the future or something and while I am a huge fan of theories revolving around what the human brain can accomplish the idea that learning a language allows time travel is a little too big of a stretch IMO. The entire political angle is also over acted and comical really. I have never seen a movie that got such praise be one that I found so incomplete..almost comical in the holes the writer left. I can only shake my head. First review on this site and most likely the last unless some other extremely mediocre movie gets immense praise. And just for the record the parts with Amy Adams and her child in the movie are extremely heartfelt. Having 3 kids of my own those scenes did tug on my heart strings, but it did nothing to help the score of the movie from my perspective.","JUL 25, 2017",2,Mistery
Arrival,"I have watched Arrival four times to find any redeeming qualities to it. I felt the acting was fine but over rated since the movie was so low key and not particularly entertaining. My first problem with it was the way they portrayed the aliens. It is the same old thing, make them look like monsters who have no hands ect., making it totally unbelievable they could build anything to travel anywhere. The movie is more about time than anything else. It is unlike any other movie I have seen so saying there were cliches I found to be inane and won't use that. The soundtrack droned and was very distracting sometimes eclipsing what the actors were saying. The language shown would have been impossible for a linguist to figure out in such a short time. A friend compared it to a Tibetan circle language yet upon investigation, the linguist that created it said nothing about it being anything more than made up. It's a love story in a way but done in a very boring way. I didn't find the movie interesting or thought provoking because the subject matter within it...time isn't linear is old news. Amy Adams did a good job with what she was given but it wasn't much. The movie simply is not entertaining and leaves one with unanswered questions. Unless one is very cerebral this will not be able to hold the attention of most viewers for long. I was very disappointed and have watched hundreds of science fiction movies. I have also read a number of reviews around the net and no one person got the same thing out of this film.

There is a twist to the movie that was mildly interesting but seemed very copy cat of Interstellar, and then it ended very abruptly. I hated the ending. Basically there was no explanation of the reasoning behind anything and you are left hanging. It's just supposed to make you appreciate your humanity and question your life choices I guess.

Get Out,"'Get Out' was very highly recommended by a friend, also a fellow film enthusiast, and the subject matter of the film really interested me. Add to that a very promising trailer, the award nominations and wins and mostly positive word of mouth (even with the very vocal detractors), and interest was higher. High expectations were not only met but also exceeded. Apologies for the cliché, but to me that is the best way to sum up my personal experience watching 'Get Out'. Can totally see why it was as well received as it was, though can also see why it has divided audiences on here. While it will never be one of my favourite films, 'Get Out' is among the better films of 2017 and does live up to the hype. It's an incredibly well-made film visually, with stylish and unsettling cinematography and editing and some disturbingly surreal imagery that adds to, and enhances, the unease and sense of dread. That the direction was done by a first-time director is a shock in itself, one of the most outstanding debut directing jobs seen in a long time by me. It's nostalgic in its embracing of contemporary and classic horror and also brave in the accomplished handling of the film's combative themes. Being somebody who considers music important when talking about it, the music looms suitably ominously and fits well. 'Get Out' benefits from an extremely smart and clever script (though 'The Shape of Water' and especially 'Lady Bird' were worthier wins for the Best Original Screenplay Oscar in my view), that takes on a lot of elements and balances them adeptly and the individual elements handled very effectively. Despite how it sounds, 'Get Out' struck me as more of a thriller with horror and comedic elements. It is highly successful on this front, with the thriller elements being taut, suspenseful and unsettling, the comedic ones being darkly funny and clever and the horror ones being imaginatively shocking and subtly uneasy. There is even some social commentary and interracial themes explored, and done thoughtfully and just about avoids preachiness while hitting hard still. While all the performances are very fine, it is Daniel Kaluuya's superb lead performance that burns in the memory the most. My only complaint of 'Get Out' is the too pat and somewhat silly ending that felt tacked on and like it came out of a different film, to me it too ended on a tonally jarring and that's it note. Until then, the film was this close to being a masterpiece. So it was frustrating that it just missed out on that distinction. Nonetheless it's a great film that is among the year's better ones, brought down by an underwhelming ending. 9/10 Bethany Cox","MAR 14, 2022",9,Mistery

If his backstory was the same except he was put into foster care then that could have given a bit more depth. Maybe he's trying to be whiter for his girlfriend's family because he feels that's the only way to climb the ladder in the world. Maybe it isn't ""he wants to be whiter"" but rather he was able to become a social chameleon through his upbringing, shifting from home to home. He feels like he has no identity of his own and his girlfriend is an anchor for him. So by that logic he's going to try as hard as he can to fit in. Then he realizes something fishy is going on and he can't stomach being treated like an other. He doesn't actively want anything in the final film and it's hard to connect with him because of that. Yeah he has a sad backstory but it feels undercooked. He should have his own reason for wanting to stay behind. Thematically and narratively, the movie is kind of at odds. I think I have pretty reasonable criticisms, I enjoyed it, I had fun during my first viewing in theaters. I think a 6/10 is still a passing grade and it's better than most debut feature films.","JUL 21, 2022",6,Mistery

It's listed as a horror movie but it never actually gets scary as the premise is just too far-fetched. For some reason it tries to do jump scares and even gore towards the end but never does it manage to be effective. Sure, the characters create a suspenseful atmosphere but it never manages to create any suspension of disbelief. I read other reviews that mention plot twists but I have no idea what they are talking about. Everything plays out in the most predictable manner. As far as the social commentary goes, the movie depicts a world in which every white person cannot avoid making racial remarks for one second. I guess it fits the ridiculous premise, but I found it hard to draw any parallels to reality because of how grotesque the narrative is. While it is watchable, it is very difficult to take seriously.

Get Out,"A little thriller that got a lot of attention because we see a nice black guy in a white house and as he himself says in the film (the nice black guy) ""when there are too many white people, I leave in a spin"" or something like that. If a nice white guy had said that in a black house, it would have been a public stoning. But pretend it was always black and replace for example with ""when there is one it's okay, it's when there are many that there are problems"" and it turns cream. But be careful not to designate a place that is too specific or a geographical area that is too obvious like ""it feels like you're in Africa"", because you might get upset and you'll end up lynched in a public square. Obviously, victimization is in full swing in Get Out but it can also be interpreted as a sort of allegorical fable, namely the permanent paranoia of African-Americans (always the double capital letter, because we don't want a public trial!) who see evil everywhere, that is, evil white people always plotting behind the backs of good, innocent black people. Alas, the end of the film clears away any ambiguity in this regard and it is certainly a missed opportunity. What remains is a little thriller which has difficulty getting started, then which turns into a sort of carnivalesque grand puppet in its last part: it's funny in spite of its delirium or thanks to it, we no longer know... but it's funny. Then the ending is very classic, too classic after all (theory of the evil White man in the first degree). But imagine for a moment inverting the colors and instead of black and white, make it white and black: hello the shitstorm of media shit that would create a buzz all over the web! no, the film would be completely banned! we would then have gone from victimization to demonization... or stigmatization.

Seriously though, I don't think I've ever seen a movie try so hard to lay out it's social commentary in such an explicit and undeniable way so quickly. It's all just surface level racial stereotype type stuff too, just the typical modern leftwing racial tension stoking. The actual directing and cinematography is not that good either. It honestly feels pretty low budget. Other than the opening ""stay woke"" song, the rest of the musical soundtrack also had me cringing as it all felt very soap operay at times, especially when layered on top of the poor cinematography. The whole movie has a ""made for TV"" feel to it. Most of the acting is mediocre at best, however Daniel Kaluuya did a great job in his role as he always does. That chick from 'Being John Malkovich' did a pretty good job as well. Unfortunately it's the material these actors were given to work with that is the problem. The writing and dialogue are very poor. This is what happens when a writer's main objective is to force ""the message"" to the forefront to this extreme a degree, the potential for actual interesting dialogue and story telling gets put on the back burner and ultimately discarded. As an old school classical Liberal, who wants to strive for a post-racial society, this movie was a chore to sit through. Could be argued this movie is pro-segregation propaganda. The main metaphor is that white people manipulate black people into giving up their ""authentic blackness"" and conforming to ""whiteness"" (whatever the hell those two things are). This movie is a paranoid fever dream for the racially obsessed so-called ""anti-racists"". I'm sure Robin DiAngelo and Kendi love this movie. They probably watch it on a weekly basis. They may even put it on every night to lullaby themselves to sleep. I'm assuming all the praise for this movie is for purely ideological reasons coming from people in that ""anti-rasict"" ideological camp. Very horrible and cringy movie, on multiple levels.

At first it was interesting and I was hoping there would be clues to help us figure out what might be going on, that maybe Chris would find evidence or over hear something, but no such luck. Maybe there could have been a scene without him, that gave us some insight, there was absolutely nothing until the very end, when it was all thrust into our faces and even then it really didn't make a whole lot of sense.

The most dissappointing aspect of the movie is that the director actually succeeds in capturing the proper mood of eeriness that hooks the interest of the audience when watching a movie of this category. Unfortunately, the movie crashes and burns when all the pieces start coming together - or rather does NOT come together. The symbolism comes hard and heavy, and many audiences will already know the racial undertones that the plot conveys. It is actually solidly acted with all the actors going full bore into their respective characters, and the story creates the mood of off kilter discomfort very well when it comes to the interactions between the straight laced protagonist and the surrounding cast. However the movie devolves into a series of illogical missteps that completely undermines the intent of the movie. Nothing is more dissapointing than seeing a movie start off with great promise and anticipation for a satisfying conclusion, than to see it totally fall apart at the wheels no sooner than the start of the second act, and this is precisely when this movie loses its appeal completely. Serious, possibly thought provoking situations foreshadowed at the start of the movie break down into outright buffoonery more akin to a Wayans brothers Scary Movie plot. One particular development is a shark-jumping moment that makes the movie go from psychological thriller to full on science fiction. Many of these twists and the direction that the movie goes into seem to have been to make a symbolic or overt social commentary, something I understand is a point the film is attempting to create. However, the method is clumsy and ridiculously heavy handed. The most disappointing part is that the commentary is on point - but the sacrifice made to story, plot and logic is so insulting to the audience that the imagery is dulled to an afterthought. Many guides to the hidden meanings of this film exist, but as a movie watcher, should we really need to have a guide book to a story in order for it to make any semblance of sense? I am fairly harsh on this movie because it is one of those films where the initial plot is interesting enough to capture you, you invest your time to learn more, and the result is a slap in the face. You feel cheaply tricked by the time the end credits roll. Most importantly, the subject matter that this movie explores deserves quite a bit more than this schlock.","JUN 2, 2017",3,Mistery

It is very well based on the game, I don't deny that, the only bad thing is that there is love and I didn't like that at all.

Silent Hill: Revelation 3D,"This review may contain spoilers *** Silent Hill: Revelation is a fangirl's haven. They even referenced TRAVIS! I freaked the hell out!! Granted, they changed quite a bit from the game and there were some things that were kinda ""what?"" with their changes. (Full review and spoilers) In the game, Harry is killed in their apartment when Heather gets back from her Nightmare at the mall. What drives her to Silent Hill is finding out WHY her father was killed and who she is. Vincent you don't even really meet him until a third through the game, though I get why they introduced him like they did for the film. Then you have Douglas, who wasn't supposed to die that soon and actually helps Heather. He didn't help her in the slightest, so his character was just kinda… there. And Claudia was the one that was supposed to actually off him after telling him what Heather was going to be used for. I was looking SO FORWARD to that!! Some pros were that the movie starts out similarly to the game, with her dreaming that she's at the Lakeside Amusement Park. What got confusing, though, was that Nightmare!Silent Hill was so prevalent and there wasn't a lot of the typical Silent Hill (more on this later). I will say that, this time, Pyramid Head made sense. He didn't make sense at all in the first one, considering he's in the second game (unrelated to the first and third games) and is the manifestation of James' inner turmoil. They switched his meaning around to have him in this film, but it worked and you can tell that it was really something for the fans to have Pyramid Head portrayed as he was. As a fan, I DIDN'T MIND AND I LOVED THE TAKE. There was a lot of action, which, while it's nice, it took away from the character development and the real dark feel of Silent Hill. The whole love of Silent Hill is being completely alone, trying to solve puzzles and figure out everything on your own, occasionally running into another person, but eventually just going your own way. That's what draws the fans to the series and why the first film was pretty damn good. Look, I've been a Silent Hill fan since the first game was released in the 90s and I even own the Silent Hill Play Novel I taught myself to read Japanese all so I could play that game. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh, but then again…. Like I said, there was a lot to put into one film from one of the best games in the series. It was an interesting take! And while I may not go to see it in theatres again, I will definitely be getting it when it comes out on DVD. Oh! They also had about five different rearrangements of ""Never Forget Me, Never Forgive Me,"" each sounding wickedly awesome and Mary Elizabeth McGlynn was singing the ending theme. That just *made* it for me. I love that they use Akira Yamaoka's music in it. The music really does give the feel of Silent Hill.","MAY 10, 2013",10,Mistery
Silent Hill: Revelation 3D,"I am unsure like most of the reviews on here how this movie is getting such bad reviews! After waiting 6 years for this movie to come out I was not disappointed. The movie stayed very true to the game itself and the girl who played Heather looked amazingly similar to the character in the game. I felt the acting was real and believable aside from the fact that she hardly seemed scared at all where as I would have been peeing myself! Even if you have never played the games before the movie is still a solid 6 or 7 out of 10 but the way it stayed true to the story I was looking forward to seeing unfold was just awesome. Honestly I think the reason that it did so badly was because I had no idea the movie was even coming out because I never seen a preview on TV or in the theatres, and the movie opened on the weekend that everyone is out celebrating Halloween. Lets face it... Video Game fans most definitely take advantage of the Halloween holiday! I think you should see the movie and decide for yourself. It definitely could have been longer because it did feel a tiny bit rushed but I loved it and I really hope that we get another installation to this film!

HOMAGE. The monsters were beautiful. The 3d was fantastic. And all the key points from the game came across very well. My favorite part was how they intertwined the First film perfectly and still kept the film true to silent hill 3. I.e. Happy Burger, the mall, theme park etc. The only negatives for me were the portrayals of Vincent and Douglas. Vincent was too Good as opposed to the game. And Douglas was simply cut down to a minor character. Also I understand alot of fans will be angry because of Pyramid Head being in the film, but they need to understand, PYRAMID HEAD WASNT A MANIFESTATION OF JAMES SUNDERLANDS FEARS, THE CREATOR SAID THAT HIMSELF.

Silent Hill: Revelation 3D,"A nice movie, full of fan-service like places and names from the game saga and specially from Silent Hill 3. A really good adaption from the game. The only thing that a did not like about this movie was that the director attempted to use the first one as a start or a base in the story line and in my opinion that was a bad move. The fist one was not a good movie(I mean Harry Mason, was an adoptive father and WIDOWER). But saving that, in my opinion this was a good movie even if it was really far from being a horror movie.","MAR 23, 2013",9,Mistery
Silent Hill: Revelation 3D,"For video game fans: It's just as faithful to the game as the first movie was faithful to the first game (think about it). The movie ran in the same order as it did in the video game, and contains so many references for the third game installment. As for the atmosphere it was a bit tame compared to the games, but still chilling. The acting was pretty decent and the special effects were amazing. It's thrills it's what mostly stands out from the film, it has its scary moments and a horrifying atmosphere. It's bloodier than the first one. Though I was kinda left out with a feeling wanting for more, I wasn't satisfied enough, which is why I'm desperately calling out for another installment, I mean this franchise can be just as successful as Resident Evil. If you liked the first one, you'll like this one too, especially if your a fan of the game. If you're not a fan of the games, then I don't think you'll get quite as much thrills as I got.","MAY 10, 2013",10,Mistery
Silent Hill: Revelation 3D,"In my opinion was better than the first one, but I must say that it was not horrible as some sites judged. As far as the actors have to say that fared; certainly nothing special but I think the dubbing in Italian has a little spoiled acting. There were many scenes and quotes that brought me back to SH3 (and not only) and I think the fans will appreciate who is so even though the plot is not really faithful to the game. The flaw of the film I think it's the script a bit too simpleminded but still full of surprises. The strength of the film are the sets (very similar to the game) monsters (and many really well done) and the atmosphere. But I must say that I found the special effects a little fake. Then let me tell you that in the end there will be a clash, but can be spectacular, but that did not seem suitable for a film like SH. Great songs Yamaoka. A film that must be seen from without high expectations but that is not bad (even if I consider the first best).","NOV 9, 2012",8,Mistery
Silent Hill: Revelation 3D,"I find Silent Hill: Revelation to be just perfect for the movie based on Silent Hill 3 and on the video game on the whole. Adelaide Clemens looks and acts absolutely like Heather from the video game. The setting is horrifying enough, white-gray foggy outside scenes follow rust-bloody shots of the inner side of the most scary and mysterious city. A lot of scenes are taken from the game, that's a nice gift for its fans. The plot is really interesting and twisty and it's understandable for everyone, not only video game fans who know the background of the story (like it happened with the first movie). The script is well-thought out, the dialogues sound realistic, the connection to the first movie is clearly explained. Silent Hill 2 has not come down to just an expensive video clip full of visual effects like what happened to the latest Resident Evil movies where the whole script can be written on just one sheet of paper with the most informative dialogues being: ""I need to recharge ammo"", ""Cover me"" and ""Run. I'll try and stall them to give you time to get clear."" The monsters are disgusting and creepy, every motion they execute curdles the blood. The unceasing gritting sounds and even piano music create an atmosphere of true horror. I just think Silent Hill 2 could be a little bit longer, the time in the movie theatre passed too fast, but that's not a big bit of complaint. Well, I think it is a must-watch movie, containing a lot of outstanding features of the video game (which can satisfy the most devoted fan of the game), but being a good independent movie for every horror lover to enjoy.","MAY 10, 2013",10,Mistery

I will admit that there were a few instances of nonsensical plot and / or writing but I felt that overall, this was a worthy entry in the series with great atmosphere and great acting to boot.

Silent Hill: Revelation 3D,"Similar to one of the other user reviews (mavizzle), I too was not fan of first movie, but am a die-hard fan of the game series. If you enjoyed the games, there are ample reasons for you to be satisfied with the movie. For starters, the Silent Hill movies are a rare commodity, they are not created often enough! I saw the trailer and waited three weeks to see the movie in theaters. Paid over $12 a ticket, would have gladly paid more. If I had to drive three hours to have seen it, I would have done so. The movie itself has a large amount of 3D (if you have any doubt, watch it and compare it to others such as SAW 3D and you will see the difference). The monsters in the movie closely resemble those in the games, with a few differences and original creations tossed in. In addition, both the detective as well as heather herself closely resemble the in-game characters. Few movies have done such a wonderful job choosing such incredible matches such as these. Moreover, the music, atmosphere, and various other minor elements (red shoe in the motel, Apt 106 selection, amusement park, mall, et cetera) all contribute to a warm feeling of familarity to any Silent Hill 3 fan - and who can forget the bus at the end of the movie?! Conversely, the movie does have its weak points. Some of the acting was the best, as well as a bit of a few cheesy verbal lines spoken by Vincent. Also, depending on the theater, the lighting can be quite dim for the 3D glasses causing a difficulty in visuals. Lastly, the movie does take an alternative path on the story plot. However, otherwise, anyone who has played the game will easily have foreseen a possible NC-17 rating slap on the former ending to the game if it was redone in movie format. In short, the movie is fantastic. Ignore the critics and go see it for yourself (if it's still playing) and if you enjoy horror. it may or may not spook you. If you are a gamer, see it. If you enjoy SH, see it. if you like horror, go watch it. I have seen nearly every horror movie out this year and the last, this one is worth the wait. 10/10","NOV 17, 2012",10,Mistery

Being one who grew up watching the games being played, and playing them myself, Silent Hill has stayed true to it's fans with the movies. Which is a lot more than I can say about the generic and repetitive 'Resident Evil' movie series. The 3-D was phenomenal. Not an over the top, things flying at your face film. The 3-D wasn't used as the films selling point. Rather, it enhanced the movie. Making the beautiful sets and characters come to life! It was easy enough to follow, (even for those who haven't played the game) and yet stuck with the games. Not only was the art quality great, you'll fall in love with the main protagonists; Heather and Vincent. (Adelaide Clemens and Kit Harington) The only downfall was the films length. While it deserved at least a 2 1/2 hour time slot, it fell short with 1 hour and 34 minutes. This however, should not keep you from seeing this masterpiece of a creepy thriller.

Sometimes, unfortunately, it can't outmatch Resident Evil: Retribution's success in IMAX 3-D (Still the lowest grossing movie in the franchise, but manages to overcome the odds overseas).

The plot is dead basic and I think even the most diehard horror fan would find themselves debating whether to leave or not after the first ten goofy minutes of this hilarious nonevent of a movie. Its a shame that Sean Bean who can be one of the scariest actors out there is relegated to a small support role and isn't onscreen for very long.

Silent Hill: Revelation 3D,"A watchable but all together dumber feeling sequel. The first Silent Hill movie felt like watching one of the games, minus the scares. Because of that it was enjoyed by many SH fans, myself included. This one feels less like SH, and more like some torture-porn horror movie along the lines of one of the later ""Saw"" movies due to it's grotesque imagery and excessive gore. The plot, which is based of off the 3rd game, dives deeper into the SH lore from the games, does a good job of adapting and tying the plot of the 3rd game into the plot of the first movie, and is all together much less confusing than many found the first movie to be. Because of this there are plenty of great moments that are throwbacks to the game and some interesting twists on the game's characters. Where the movie stumbles is that it makes the whole thing just feel dumber, cheeper, and cheesier. There's no fear to be found here and through ways I won't spoil they take Pyramid Head and make him feel like a joke, which is basically a sin in the eyes of any SH fan. Myself included. It also doesn't help that there are tons of lines of awful dialog and our lead actress (Adelaide Clemens) can feel weak at times. Shockingly though the worst performance (possibly the only bad one) comes from Game of Thrones star Taylor Kitsch. He honestly doesn't seem to be trying here. There are also plenty of scenes that just feel dumb and/or unintentionally goofy. It relies too much on dumb theatrics in order to bring scares that have already proven time and time again to not work. All of these issues drag down ""Revelation"" from being a great homage to the SH series, and turn it into yet another cheesy video game movie. That's not to say it's not worth watching. What saved the movie for me was my HUGE Silent Hill fandom. It made overall experience watchable and often entertaining for me, even when I was cringing at some stupid thing that happened on-screen that insulted my inner SH fan. It's the constant references, scenes, and twists on the source material that kept me entertained. It's those same things that will make it at least worth watching for any Silent Hill fan. It's the strength of the games that keep it from being terrible. So anyone not familiar with them should strongly consider passing on this movie. I'll be the first to say that I thought the 3rd game took on a less-scary tone. I saw humor and felt a more self-aware and tongue-in-cheeck tone with that game. That being said this movie's goofy moments don't feel like that, and instead just feel like bad direction. So my overall opinions on the movie are kind of mixed. I still think any SH fan should check it out, because as I've said before my love of the source material kept me enjoying the movie overall. It does feel like another bad video game movie at times, but it clings close enough to the material of the game it's based on to keep things at the very least watchable for fans. I enjoyed it even though I'm also very disappointed with it. It doesn't live up to the first movie, which IMO might be the best video game movie ever. My overall score is a 6.4/10.","AUG 30, 2014",6,Mistery

Though the first film wasn't great it was definitely a film, made by a filmmaker. Revelation felt like fan fiction--which if you're a big fan of SH3, you'll probably love it. I tend to use The Godfather as a basis of comparison for films--cinematography, music, writing, directing, acting--all supreme. But Silent Hill: Revelation needs to be compared to the Spiderman Ride in Orlando--which it barely just falls short of in terms of entertainment. The dialog was awful but Sean Bean gave a good attempt at making it seem emotionally inspired. But a film this plot-driven and reliant on surprises for scares really has no time for emotion and I was more annoyed by ""character moments"" than desperately seeking them. Honestly, if it was just an hour and half of Heather running from the Manikin-Spider, I would have been more satisfied!","OCT 29, 2012",4,Mistery

Silent Hill: Revelation 3D,"It's quite a pity to see this movie as an adaption to the infamous video game series, as this movie fails to provide the tension the games did already a few years back. I can not quite understand the destructive score the critics used to rate it, but I can agree that this movie truly isn't good. The story is unclear and leaves so many gaps that there isn't space for good moments somewhere in between. The acting is merely oky, but not more and the ending is very disappointing. In respect to the video games this movie is a shame, but for someone who doesn't know the games' plot this movie won't probably make sense. But the worst part of it is that at all points this movie completely fails to scare the viewer. There is nothing obscure enough, other than the background story, maybe, to build up some tension. I can imagine that it is really hard to combine the hours of gameplay from a video game in an average movie, but this could truly have had a greater outcome. there are still a few things I like abiut it, though. For first, the setting and the ""monsters"" look really good and sufficiently realistic, the setting is in my opinion well chosen. The best is definately the sound design, which is fantastic. The soundtrack for this film, which was also adapted from the second original Silent Hill is close to being my altime-favorite and the even the soundeffects for the evil enemies are convincing enough to could have been potentially frightening, if the rest of the movie would have allowed so. I have pretty much said everything already; Silent Hill Revelation looks good, sounds good and scores as some kind of experiment, but as a movie, especially from the horror-genre is disappointing and will never receive good feedback, which is understandable. I wouldn't not say it's very amusing to see this movie, but neither it's directly a waste of time, just nothing worth to stay in memory after all.","MAR 17, 2018",4,Mistery

I am intimately familiar with the Halo of the Sun, the Seal of Metatron, the Order, Valtiel, ""God,"" the layers of reality, Leonard, Claudia, Heather Mason, Harry Mason, Pyramid Head, Alessa, Dhalia, Robbie the Rabbit, the fog, Brookhaven, Vincent, and Lakeside Amusement Park, all from the games. If you don't recognize every single one of those from memory, then you will likely be lost throughout much of the movie. The film loosely follows the plot of the third game, and even then, you need to be very familiar with the story from that game to get what's happening most of the time. The acting is subpar in most of the characters, and there is way too much exposition. The set pieces are excellent, and some of the creatures are inspired, but the climax was rushed and the general pacing of the movie was poor. If you are indeed a super hardcore Silent Hill fan, then this movie will address many canonical issues that are largely unexplored in the games and deal with various fan-based theories. There are also so many references to each game in the franchise, including Downpour, that hardly a shot goes by without one coming in somewhere. Almost every set in the film was pulled from one of the games. Excellent fan candy, but not much else, I'm afraid.","OCT 26, 2012",5,Mistery

The movie was at least a bit scary at the beginning, but when the Darkness finally engulfs Silent Hill, it has the opposite effect of what the viewer would expect all the horror is simply gone which I think was the biggest mistake of the movie, at least when talking about the horror aspect. Then the soundtrack was definitely one of the strongest aspects of the movie. The actors also did a good job, which I didn't expect after seeing some sneak peaks.

Silent Hill: Revelation 3D,"This is my first (of many I hope) review here. I apologize beforehand for any mistakes, as english is not my native language. I wanted to write a review because, having read a bunch of them out there, I couldn't relate to any of them and I hope, when somebody reads mine, it'll go different. I went to the movies expecting not a great movie, so I wasn't disappointed in the end. I think this movie, exceeds (greatly) the first Silent Hill in staying faithful to the game. It has one or two things that bugged me, but all along it keeps up. Heather is well portrayed, finally Sean Bean is called HARRY as it should be in the first place (so is the case of Sharon, who the hell is Sharon), Douglas is okay, even though I would like an older guy to play the role. It's cool that the movie goes all the way with the original characters from SH3, as it brings the bad guys on board too. Don't really mind the plot twist about Vincent, personally I wouldn't have done that (but, what the hell, it has to be appealing to the non-fans, the thing is, I think the writing was kinda weak there). All the ""famous places"" from the game are here. Monsters and CGI effects are way good; the nurses are really cool and so is Pyramid-head. Music is okay, thanks to Akira. But in this case I liked the score from the previous SH better. Although, listening to some of the original tunes is great. Scenarios hit it off. It felt like Silent Hill, but somehow the movie fails to deliver. I dunno, it just wasn't a scary movie as were the games. Hey they tried, but they couldn't, I didn't feel the need to cover my eyes once (but it's still better than the first). They try to sneak up on you but it's just too predictable and all in all, it just doesn't get the eerie appeal of the game that makes you crouch under your seat. I felt the beginning of the movie was awesome, just like the game. But then it falls apart. It spends some time trying to fill some plot-holes, linking both movies, but staying true to the game. The first part of the movie, script-related, it goes way too fast. If you're a fan, you're gonna like the portrayal of Silent Hill and the characters. You have to let some stuff go obviously. Douglas part is too little, and Vincent's story is a bit different this time. You'll love to see Happy Burguer or some other places from the game. If you're not a fan then, you won't get as excited by those things, you'll like the effects, the music and the scenarios, but won't get scared or anything and it'd round up to be just another movie, you'd have better checked out at your place and not the theatre.

The poor script is reinforced by a miserable and unhappy direction, both by Michael J. Bassett.

Silent Hill: Revelation 3D,"The only scary or gruesome thing about this movie is that it might be the end of Silent Hill. Yes, it's that bad, coupled that with an awful game earlier this year, Silent Hill is in all new low. Mercilessly butchering the memory of one of the best games in last gen, Silent Hill: Revelations 3D is a poor reinterpretation which fails almost in its entirety and they make sure to stomp the franchise while it's on the ground with truly horrible 3D implementation. Any resemblance to the game is merely cosmetic. The look of protagonist, misty town, gridiron underworld, they are all practically miming the game. This may work as a screenshot, but put them in motion, it's a travesty to the title. Heather Mason (Adelaide Clemens) has the hair and clothes, yet she fumbles in times, bordering on teen angst rather than the sorrowful persona of the game. It's amazing how the game digital character could exhibit more appropriate sadness, meanwhile the real life version somewhat struggles with the delivery. It's like she's in constant lousy mood and relies too heavily on screams, which practically everyone does here. There's also an variation of the cast, Vincent (Kit Harington), who is Jon Snow in Game of Thrones, but so Twilight here. He substitutes the private investigator part, who barely has any screen time and while I welcome changes, this one is needless and a blatant bait for teen drama. The private eye had odd relationship with Heather as they were both lost in Silent Hill, Vincent doesn't add to that, he's plain, very predictable, and can be mistaken from 90's slasher movie cast. It's strange that there are actually some quality names here; Sean Bean, Malcolm McDowell, Carrie Anne-Moss, but they only have brief screen time and not much to go with, considering how mediocre the script and screenplay are. Sean Bean does his best for the father figure, it's not a great performance, although he is believable as the parental role. And he offers a puzzle whether he continues his tradition of dying in the movie or not as Harry Mason actually died in the game. It'd be bearable if they only mess up that far, but the brilliant minds that made this had an epiphany: 3D. Oh god, the utter failure of it. Effect of 3D, as we all know, can also be accompanied by the blurry and blindingly dark effect. Now, add that to a movie where the bulk of it is in darkness, you have a horrifyingly bad visual. Then there are the cheap scares, so prevalently, from monsters that scream at the screen. Everything in the movie throws, stabs, yells at the screen. I've had enough of this persistent crap in my face. And when I said everything, that includes Heather. She shines the flashlight at the audience every few minutes. Imagine a putrid dark room, you can barely see anything, and then she flashes at your fragile eyes, repeatedly. Why the bloody hell someone would think that's a good idea is beyond common sense. All of these atrocious concepts make a visual nightmare, not in its intended goal. To be fair, it sometimes looks and sounds like the game, albeit only seldom, and a couple of scenes are almost okay. But that's buried in piles of questionable concepts and horrific execution of them, it's more of a laughable annoyance than adaptation of once a great game. What made the game so popular was the use of details to make an atmosphere. Flashlight, radio static, camera angle and the audio made an excellent terrifying world, the movie is anything but. This might be last tour in Silent Hill.","DEC 22, 2012",3,Mistery

Silent Hill: Revelation 3D,"Well ... it was fun to watch - if for the wrong reasons. Aweful and ridiculous plot and dialogue by blant and meaningless characters who behave and act stupidly will have you grin and giggle throughout a movie that tries to be exaggeratingly heavy on exposition and explaning but still manages to make no sense at all. It contradicts itself all the time and when it doesn't, it presents situations that are very unlikely and unbelievable if thought through. To say something good, the movie looks and sounds great, there's no denying it and even the 3D looks good. (Though the latter will depend on the theatre you visit, too.) I also thought the actors did a good job, the horrible script isn't their fault. So how about comparing the movie to the game it's based on? The similarities mostly start and end with the namedropping. In general, there's no need to slavishly stick to the game's plot ect., but if you change stuff, it should benefit the movie. Revelation has the following problem: it wants to be a sequel to the first movie and yet tell the plot of the third game which is problematic because the first movie already altered the key plot aspects of the first game significantly and especially those that are relevant for how the story was continued in the third game. (The second game had a completely independent story.) Now it would've been no problem to just stick with what the first movie did and build on it, but instead, the narration tries to combine the two differing stories - BUT does so very poorly, because first of all, in doing so, it does contradict certain facts known from the first movie and second of all, it still changes the story of the third game anyways! What the ---- was it good for to completely break the continuity and the canon of the first movie just to include the third game's plot when you, then, alter that plot anyways? You could've just altered the game's plot to fit the first movie and fine! If you like the games, the saddest thing about this movie is that it simply doesn't feel like a Silent Hill. It is not scary at all, there is absolutely neither mystery nor confusion, the emotional aspects are shallow and uninteresting and the town of Silent Hill is overcrowded with people. Which is in itself, independently from the games, ridiculous because on the one hand, the town is so super dangerous ect., but on the other hand, a full community has been living and surviving there for over a century among the hostile monsters and a spoiled brat gone wild with destructive super powers. For instance, the asylum in the movie is crawling with monsters that kill everyone they can get a hold of and yet, the order, trapped in the very same nightmare world, is using the place as a psychological hospital. (Basically, they brainwash people in there or make them prisoners when they disobey.) In one scene, they bring one of the characters there for ""treatment"", bring him into a room full of monster nurses, try to do their job among them, and then, surprisingly, get killed by those even though they knew the nurses were in that room and that they were dangerous. Fleeing whenever ""the darkness"" - yikes - approaches is the number one rule, but all of a sudden, the ""darkness"" is the perfect working place. Oooops, dead. That's how much sense the movie makes. Overall, yes, you can have a good laugh at the movie and it's remarkably well done, but that's about it. If you are a fan of the series and have a lot of humour, you will enjoy the movie for how funny it is and for all the little innuendos and references to the game series, but will also feel like you want to cry because the movie butchers and, pretty much, insults he franchise. If you don't know the games, this movie will make even less sense to you and you won't even be able to enjoy the shameless fan-service, so ... better go see something else.","DEC 1, 2012",3,Mistery

The Good: The effects for some of the creatures (which seemed to carry over from the first film) were decent. The Bad: Just silly. While the first one was a pleasant surprise to me, this offering was horribly done. The story jumps around and is overly complex for a film of this nature. The creatures, which were not overused and kept mostly secretive in the first film, are in your face and overdone in this film. The acting was laughable and the obvious overuse of 3D (where EVERYTHING FLIES at you!) was annoying.","NOV 12, 2014",1,Mistery

Silent Hill: Revelation 3D,"I give this a one solely because Of Akira's soundtrack. The weird thing about this film is, it is inexplicably bad. By that I mean it has all the ingredients to be a fantastic film, great actors, great director, crew, source material, it has it all. So I really don't know how it came out this badly. And for the people saying that the bad reviews are only given by people who didn't play the game, WRONG. I've played every Silent Hill game outside of the arcade game and that has no bearing on the fact that this film is terrible. It fails spectacularly on every level, in fact. The actors feel like they are completely phoning it in, the cgi monsters are so over the top they come off as comic rather than scary, and ya know what, I'm just going to say it, Why is Pyramid Head protecting Heather? Also why is he running rides at Lakeview? Why is Vincent suddenly a 20 something hipster love interest? And last but certainly not least, why on earth is the transition to the otherworld generally denoted here by mass amounts of melted saran wrap? If this was a high school Halloween haunted house, it might be more acceptable, but for the price of a 3D theater ticket on opening night, it was a total ripoff. If you really just have an hour and a half you have to waste, stream it on Netflix. Better yet, watch ""Deathwatch"" One of the director's previous films, and oddly much more Silent Hillish.","NOV 14, 2013",1,Mistery
Silent Hill: Revelation 3D,"Horror in Silent Hill: The Revelation (2012) Synopsis: For many years, Heather Mason and her father, Harry, have been on the run from dangerous forces that she does not understand. Heather continues to suffer terrifying nightmares and is frightened by the disappearance of her father, and on the eve of her 18th birthday, she discovers that she is not who she thinks she is. Her revelation takes her deep into the demon world of Silent Hill, where she could be trapped forever. Opinion: At the time my expectations for this film were very high when I saw that the story would be based on the third video game in the franchise, the result was not even millions of light years away from what the first film was, bad special effects, story poorly executed, generic, poorly acted characters without charisma, they turned Heather into a girl without any personality and Claudia, who was the main villain of Silent Hill 3, was used even worse, that they placed the Matrix actress to play her It doesn't say much, while in the game the girl was a twisted and despicable crazy woman, in the movie she doesn't do anything to you, poorly acted. The only good thing was the references to the video games Silent Hill Origins and Silent Hill Downpour that left open the possibility of a second sequel, but this one was so poorly received that the outlook was not good, fortunately the director of the first installment confirmed the possibility of make another film, if he manages to make it, the result may be better.

Annabelle,"The film Annabelle, is both exciting and scary, while continuously keeping you on the edge of your seat not knowing when the action will surprise you. When it comes to the goal of horror movies, there must be fear instilled into the viewer. Annabelle meets the requirements, it does not shy away from instilling fear into the viewer. I found the film to be exciting because you really didn’t know what to expect in the beginning. Comparing it to most horror films, nothing really happens till half way through the movie. Annabelle was exciting because within the first 5 min the plot commenced to build. You knew there was something wrong and it was the excitement building up with the excellent choice of music that kept you on the edge of your seat. Activity was focused on Annabelle the doll but that was not the only possessed object which kept you on the edge of your seat wondering what would happen next and who was going to be next. Although you have an expectation of what the outcome will be the twist of plot adds more to this exciting movie. The baby, why do they use a baby?! Using a baby just hits all the nerves in your body. What has a baby done to you? They are innocent. Putting them in the middle of a horror film just gives you the nerves. What’s going to happen to the baby? Great way of pumping up the excitement. Babies usually do unexpected, yet expected things; putting everything in their mouths, crawling to unexpected places, and not being able to crawl out of unexpected places. When they have teenagers in horror movies you can yell at them and tell them to get out of the way and if they don’t you can judge them by stating they were stupid or all of the above. When a baby is in harms way there is no way of yelling at the film to alert the baby; there is nothing the baby can do. Therefore the excitement! Scare factor. The random appearance of demons in unexpected locations brings a great scare factor into play. The perfect choice of color when it comes to creating a demon. The typical red face and creepy eyes has been overpassed by a dark grey apparition that you don’t know has been standing in the darkness observing the poor victims. These unexpected demons are placed spontaneously around the scene and the film has you looking at the corners of the picture for unexpected demons to pop out. Then when you finally think you see a demon it jumps out towards the camera and scare! Scare factor number two: not only is the couple haunted in their home but they continue to be haunted in new locations. Why? The frustration and fear of not being able to run away from a fearful environment. The frustration and fear of not being able to get rid of an object; like a “harmless” doll. How can you sleep? How do you truly know if you are safe in your home? These concepts within the movie leave a subconscious eariness in your mind so that when you finish watching the movie you start becoming scared of the regular noises in your own home. Are those noises really normal or is there something demonic lurking in the darkness. Not only does the movie scare you while you are watching it, but it will scare you once again when you arrive at home and the lights are off while you attempt to feel yourself around to locate the light switch. The use of regular house hold appliances catching on fire because of a little negligence, has you checking on your oven and stove to make sure your home won’t catch on fire. Excellent way of disturbing our peaceful environment. Yet another scare factor. The appearance of figures unexpectedly followed by the perfect theme song. Joseph Bishara, music composer, provides the perfect mixture of notes to make your skin chill. His previous work proves he is the number one choice when it comes to horror films. His choice of “dark music” fits perfectly into the fear concept in Annabelle. As a summary of the movie review; yes the movie is scary. Yes it definitely fits in the horror genre. And yes you will be on the edge of your seat, that is if you are not covering your eyes. Great horror film recommended greatly. Do not bring your children.","NOV 1, 2014",9,Mistery

Annabelle,"Initially when I went to go watch Annabelle I thought it would act like a sort of spin off to the Conjuring. I was expecting pretty much a rehashed version of the conjuring, you know some possession stuff being thrown around and all that jazz. I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was not what I thought. It was a horror movie that stood on its own. Some people seem to be comparing it far too much to the conjuring, and that is their downfall. I'm thinking people went to see this movie expecting the same type of thrills they got from the conjuring, but this is a different movie and therefore aims to horrify you in a different way. This movie rather than trying to scare you with the usual tropes and the lame jump scares (though there are still a few) it tries to scare you through the story, the characters and what the movie leaves out, giving your own mind some room to concoct your own horror. As with any movie a person's fears and expectations of what exactly constitutes horror is brought to the movie, if you're someone that's scared of possession type movies, where a character is possessed and the resolution comes about with an exorcism, then this isn't what you're looking for. However if you're someone interested in a strong story with a freaking terrifying demon that uses an eerie doll as an otherworldly conduit to try and steal some souls, then this is something you need to watch. There is this one scene in particular where the protagonist is running up some stairs in a thunderstorm, that should get your heart racing. I am someone that is immune to horror, I've not been scared by a horror movie since I was very young, and can predict pretty well everything from the get go. It was no different with this movie it's all fairly predictable, however I was disturbed by the demon that was present in this film. The demon- somewhat reminiscent of that from Insidious- in its physical form was the stuff of nightmares, and the movie gets extra points for having such a brilliant beast.","OCT 12, 2014",8,Mistery

Annabelle,"Effective little chiller that benefits from some imagination in the direction and three or four scenes that are a credit to the genre. In fact the first real scene of horror is one of which Hitchcock could be proud. The attractive leads are also better than the usual cyphers placed in these types of films and the story is generally quite logically played out. References to Polanski's 'Rosemary's Baby' abound and there are definitely shocks to be had along the way. One sequence involving a sewing machine, a hob and some popcorn is cut to elicit maximum tension. Two supporting players are effectively presented with menacing undertones, but the movie's biggest mystery remains why anyone would want to own such a sinister looking doll in the first place. The final scenes become somewhat predictable, but I must say that it sets up the scenario for last year's' The Conjuring' very nicely, and is actually preferable.","OCT 10, 2014",7,Mistery

I won’t go as far as to say that I didn’t like the movie, because I thought it was a pretty good movie, it was just nothing that I wanted it to be. I was expecting the movie to be scary, and I think that the movie definitely had the potential of being a super scary movie, but I think the makers held back on too much instead of just letting the scary out. The director (John R. Leonetti) definitely had very good ideas for the movie, but they must’ve pieced everything together wrong, and left pieces out, which in the end, made the movie not scary. The main characters consisted of Annabelle Wallis, who played as Mia the mother that collected dolls, Ward Horton, who played as Mia’s husband, Tony Amendola, who was “Father Perez”, and Alfre Woodard, who played as Mia’s friend, Evelyn. They included scenes that would be typically scary and somehow managed to make them not scary at all. The only thing that really makes you scared is the fact that the music gets so loud during the movie, trying to freak you out. Does it work?, maybe a little.

Mas isso não faz de ""Annabelle"" um filme bom. Ele é meio arrastado, conta com atuações ruins e personagens que você realmente não se importa. O filme não trás nada de inovador para o gênero e possui quase todos os clichês imagináveis. Ele é repleto de jumpscares irritantes e somente 1 deles me pegou de surpresa.

He's kind of messed up, has bad acting and characters that you do not really care about. The film does not bring anything innovative to the genre and has almost every imaginable cliché. It's full of annoying jumpscares and only 1 of them took me by surprise. I give 5 to this movie because it is ispirated in the great ""Rosemary's Baby"" and there are 2 really tense scenes. Other than that, do not waste your time.","JUN 21, 2019",5,Mistery

Annabelle,"Given the late 60's early 70's setting I was hoping for an old-school feeling horror film like the ones from that era. While the visual style and poor acting are from that era, the scares are not. It is very much a modern feeling horror movie, and a boring one at that. No more boring than your average non-scary horror movie, but boring nonetheless. If anything it might actually help you appreciate the attempts at tension building the average horror duds have, as this movie has none. The slow moments aren't there to build up scares. They're just there and only serve to bore. The attempts as frights are served up in the ever predictable form of jump scares. While these types of things do manage to scare some people, as evident by the fact that directors keep using them and making small fortunes at the box office, the more seasoned horror movie veteran is going to be left completely unshaken. This horror fanatic was just left yawning. While I appreciate the attention to detail that was used to bring the era back to life I wish more was done to tap some of the influence of the horror movies of that time. That way even if it wasn't scary it would have at least been a decent throwback. As it stands it lacks atmosphere and the ability to instill fear. When you consider that this is a spin-off of ""The Conjuring"" and has ties to a true story it's even more disappointing. I give the movie a 4.3/10.","FEB 13, 2015",4,Mistery

Annabelle,"E-Value: 4 Acting: 4 Plot: 5 This second instalment in The Conjuring Universe features the infamous doll, Annabelle, which is said to haunted, according to Ed and Lorraine Warren and it is still kept in the glass box in The Warrens' Occult Museum today. The Annabelle doll had previously appeared in 2013’s The Conjuring as cameo and it became popular enough to spawn a movie about the doll. This movie is a prequel to The Conjuring, taking place before the doll ended up in the possession of the Warrens as seen in the first instalment. In the year of 1967, Dr. John Form (Horton) gives his pregnant wife, Mia Form (Wallis), a rare porcelain doll as a gift for their first child. One night, something terrible happened at their neighbours' house. Their neighbours, the Higgins, were killed. While John goes to investigate the Higgins’ house and Mia calls the police from their house, she was attacked by a mysterious man and woman. Thankfully, John and the police show up in time to save Mia and the man is shot dead by the police but the woman committed suicide by slitting her own throat while holding the same porcelain doll that John gave to Mia. It is revealed in a news report that the female killer is Annabelle Higgins, the estranged daughter of the Higgins and the male killer is her unnamed boyfriend. Both of them are members of a cult. After the incident, paranormal events occur at the Forms’ house and continue to haunt Mia even after she gives birth to her baby daughter, Leah, and moving out of their old house and live in an apartment. What is even terrified is the same porcelain doll, which John threw it in a trash can at one point at the request of Mia, is found in their apartment from one of their moving boxes. Mia feels that the doll is haunted by the ghost of Annabelle but another demonic entity (Bishara) seems to be present as well. Compared to The Conjuring, the movie failed to live up to the first instalment as they are not scary enough. Some of the jump scares are really scary but some of them are too predictable. Only cheap and lousy horror movies do that kind of stunts. Another downfall of this movie is a minor character that does not really done anything much to advance the story but that character suddenly become an important plot device out of nowhere. That character even have small subplot but it was really unnecessary and irrelevant to the main story. The performance of the casts was not good enough and need some improvement to make it very convincing. However, I got to give credit that this story of this movie does set up good connection for the previous and upcoming instalment of this franchise. Hopefully, the next movie will be better than this one.","DEC 28, 2018",4,Mistery

Annabelle,"After all of the negative press I had read about ""Annabelle"", I still wanted to see it. Before all of the reviews hit, I wanted to see it, because I really, really liked ""The Conjuring"", and after - just for the lulz, as the internets say. So I did. And it's not that bad. Directed by John R. Leonetti, who confuses me a lot, this movie surprised me. It's shot in a very weird way, with a lot of awkward zooming and noobish positioning, however one particular thing caught my attention. I've seen it in other movies too, and I enjoy when it's integrated so well. ""Annabelle"" is a perfect example of this style of horror capture, where the camera is always, as if, focused on an object or part of the scenery, which makes the uneasy feeling rise; as if something is ready to creep out of there. It's quite effective. Other than that, this movie has a competent feel, but fails when it comes to originality in any form. The script is particularly weak; it feels as if it has been written up for a few days with no extra though being put into it. The overall plot is also confusing - the movie doesn't really know what it is about. New and new threads of story are introduced, but none of them seem to go anywhere. The whole purpose of everything seems simply to ""be"". It's like a ball of yarn that comes apart - you expect there to be something at the core, but there is nothing. It simply ends. The actors are pretty bland as well. They've managed to create and act-out the most generic couple ever; also, the whole sense of the era of this movie (which was very well recreated in ""The Conjuring"") is lost between a few minor implications. However, even after all of these negatives, I had fun with ""Annabelle"". It was a very simple movie that managed to never get boring. The techniques it used were old as time, and have been implied much better in other movies, however there is a certain charm about the movie that kept me interested up until the end. This movie is not for everyone. But some people might enjoy it, if they'd like to see it. The movie is partially haunting, it has a few really awesome scenes, and even when it is absolutely horrible - it's pretty funny. Overall - I don't think you can have a bad time with this movie. It's certainly a good option to have in this season. It's not ""The Conjuring"", it's much more simple in a bad way, but in that simplicity, pure joy of empty viewership can be achieved if one wishes to do so.","OCT 8, 2014",6,Mistery

Annabelle,"Horror films are usually a box of surprises because it is not easy to know if they are going to be excellent or a total crap. I didn't have many expectations for ""Conjuring"" and I was pleasantly surprised. In this case, and knowing that this film came more or less following that one, I expected something with some quality, at least... but that's not what I found. This film is a horror story created around a vintage doll that is supposedly inhabited by a demon. The film even starts well and promises a lot, but gets lost along the way. I don't know what was worse... the script was weak, with a boring and illogical story, the scares are predictable (we foreseen it ten seconds in advance, no exaggeration). But perhaps the worst of all is the absence of any tension or suspense, that sense of danger or threat that makes even the stupidest horror movie basically work. The film never manages to build that and I just watched it with the emotion and interest of those who go to the grocery store to buy some fruits. The cast is weak. Ward Horton and Annabelle Wallis are the only actors with material to show some talent. Despite that, I cannot say that I saw a dramatic show. The material given to the actors is bad and none of the character has been well developed or stands out. The film was directed by John R. Leonetti, who is good at cinematography and should stick to it (the few films he has directed, including this one, do not inspire me to try again or recommend it as director). He was responsible for the cinematography of ""Conjuring"" and, as a result, these two films have a very similar look, which indicates that he left his stamp on the visual style and camera work here. Indeed, cinematography is very good, perhaps one of the strengths here. With an excellent balance of light and shadow, it knows how to give this film an elegant and, sometimes, sinister visual beauty that, unfortunately, the script does not follow and ends up without any practical use. The sets and costumes, very much like the 60s, also look great on the screen. The soundtrack is good, but not surprising.","AUG 6, 2020",2,Mistery

You expect something to happen at this point. The head to move, the mouth to open, the eyes to blink. But no, there was nothing. Just a slow zooming in shot of a stationary inanimate doll. Look at the movie's budget vs. profit and you'll see why the producers wanted to make this movie. It was simply a cash making exercise with no thought given to the plot.

Annabelle,"The Weakest Link. Annabelle Leonetti's investment to this infamous series weighs it down like an anchor, as the thrills comes in cheap and tears negatively aplenty. The elements that usually such genre dwells upon are spooky enough to lure you in, but the execution is daft with pretentious artsy camera work that rots the somewhat established base of the film. The last act on which the entire film hangs upon, the ultimate culmination of all characters and their tragedies they bring along with, is not only poorly conceived on screen but also amateurishly written on paper. What aches you above all, is their effort of delivering a mature climax to its audience that arms itself intellectually rather than some bourgeois intense chase scene, unfortunately, it isn't polished enough to smoothly go by unnoticed. The chills and scares is left up to imagination which is always been the signature of the series as it doesn't undermine the threat or antagonist by animating it too much on screen and probably, this is the least animated among all. The performance comes in short in here, with Wallis, the major disappointment as she fails miserably to act even scared let along pour some emotion into it. Same goes for all the supporting cast, the performance is so unbearably lazy and inexpressive that the doll itself had to factor in, and she is brilliant by the way; those dead eyes. At the end of the circle, the film is a big moot point on all levels, it is questionable and pretentious with no heart to enlighten it up. Even the mythological background tale that they have brought in, isn't explored enough to satisfy the viewers.

Annabelle,"It is an article of faith in moviehouses, if not in the various houses of the Lord, that demons are always clamoring for your mortal soul. Hollywood has never adequately explained what exactly these fiends mean to do with it. Presumably, our human essence is packed with unholy phytochemicals that the demons need to survive, like some supernatural form of kale. That tenet lies at the heart of “Annabelle,” a spinoff/prequel inspired by last year’s “The Conjuring.” The villain in the new movie — a creepy doll that played an incidental role in the plot of that earlier (and far superior) horror film — is a conduit for a spirit whose state of malevolence, and apparent malnourishment, compels it to try to scare up a little soul food. The result is a disappointingly derivative dish. Working from a silly script by Gary Dauberman (writer of the straight-to- video “Blood Monkey”), director John R. Leonetti borrows a little too liberally from the dog-eared demon-doll cookbook, serving up a platter of half-baked cliches seen in everything from “Magic” to “Child’s Play” and beyond, all spiced up with lazy jump scares of the sort that have been used a hundred times before. When it comes to visuals, the director has a modest flair. Leonetti is the longtime cinematographer for horror master James Wan, having worked with him on four of the director’s films, from “Dead Silence” to “Insidious: Chapter 2.” Here, Wan acts as producer, but his oversight isn’t enough to fix the problems with his sous-chef. Set in 1970, the story centers on John and Mia (Ward Horton and Annabelle Wallis), a married couple who, along with their new baby, are terrorized by an antique doll, the hideousness of which is apparent to all but the protagonists. “Where did you find her?” squeals Mia with delight, after John presents his wife with something that resembles a ventriloquist’s dummy in drag that’s been left out in the rain for too long. “Do you know how long I’ve been looking?” Really? Looking for this freak show, with a face like a gargoyle? The thing would pull a shank on you from under its petticoat the minute you turn your back. And you’re going to put it in the baby’s room? John and Mia soon start experiencing run-of-the-mill poltergeist phenomena: phantom popcorn bursting into flames on the stove, poor television reception, a sewing machine running in the middle of the night. Not exactly blood-curdling stuff, even though Leonetti tries to make it so. He’s more successful in insinuating that every supporting character might be the antichrist, pumping up the creep-out factor in a book shop owner (Alfre Woodard), a boy next door (Gabriel Bateman) and the police detective (Eric Ladin) investigating the attacks by Satan worshippers that open the film. Ah, yes, Satan worship. At least that plot point goes somewhere. Which is more than you can say for the little boy (who seems to be clairvoyant, but aren’t they all?). He gets introduced but is never explained and soon is forgotten. But the biggest hole is the one at the center: What does the devil want with the baby’s soul? Despite its deficiencies, “Annabelle” is not without a modicum of verve. It has its unnerving moments, but they’re outweighed by the sheer stupidity and predictability of the story. It’s not a movie for connoisseurs of horror, but for more susceptible sorts, those content with a fast-food approach to fearmongering. “The devil preys on the weak and the vulnerable,” Mia says, reading aloud from the occult reference guide that she consults when Beelzebub himself starts making house calls.

The plot isn't one that entertained me that much, the mystery elements are average, though it still has a few moments. The humour is solid, as it just about everything else. I didn't love the constant ""fourth wall breaking"", but Brown helps make it work to the point it didn't get annoying. Louis Partridge impresses too. Henry Cavill and Sam Claflin are strong casts to play Sherlock and Mycroft. I liked seeing Burn Gorman and Adeel Akhtar in their respective roles. The cast, as a whole, are enjoyable. I wouldn't be surprised to see this get multiple sequels, I actually reckon it could turn into a good if unspectacular series - as long as Brown sticks around.","JAN 2, 2021",7,Mistery

Millie Bobby Brown's performances was phenomenal, she gave a perfectly balanced performance where she played her as both a very smart and intelligent woman who was also very strong physically and mentally and can do whatever she puts her mind to. Helena Bonham Carter and Sam Claflin gave terrific supporting performances. The costumes were just exceptional and gorgeous especially on Millie Bobby Brown, Helena Bonham Carter, Frances de la Tour, Henry Cavill, Louis Partridge, Sam Claflin, and all of the gowns and dresses. The makeup and hairstyling were outstanding especially on Millie Bobby Brown, Helena Bonham Carter, Susie Wokoma, Henry Cavill, Adeel Akhtar, Frances de la Tour, Hattie Morahan, and Louis Partridge.

His acting works just fine, but his buffed look does seem a bit off considering the character of Sherlock probably didn't hit the gym all that much.

After her mother disappears, the young girl comes across her brothers: the famous detective and the other hateful brother (well caricatured), and the girl sets off in search of her mother, of course, with several riddles and clues along the way, at the same time absurd. and creative. The technical part and production design are the best things the film can provide, because Enola encounters a fugitive Count along the way and, honestly, the entire narrative arc around him is quite forced. The boy is also on the run, and mysteriously appears and reappears according to what the script thinks is best. Then, come to think of it, both the mother's disappearance and the boy's escape are not even justified, it's the type of situation that could be resolved much easier, but it was delayed just to have a movie. At least Enola is nice enough and she and the guy have a lot of chemistry together. She swore that Sherlock would be more cunning, but at least he recognizes his sister's wit, and the dialogue between them is very inspired. It's a shame that most of the supporting actors are nothing more than superficial caricatures, delivering a film that is often shallow. Still, a watchable pastime.","JAN 22, 2023",7,Mistery

I only have one small caveat. Perhaps in the next part, which will hopefully be created, it would be better if the creators went their own way and were just inspired by the book. The reason is that Enola, as a character, deserves a more complicated case after all, which she would have to solve and I would also not be afraid **** interaction between her and Sherlock.

I wouldn't mind a strong female character in a deep well thought out story.

Don't worry, about 15 minutes into the film, she abandons that idea and spends the rest of the movie looking for a boy. By the end of the film, so much is left unresolved that I wonder what the point of it was. I will say that Millie Bobby Brown is a great actress and her 4th-wall breaking moments were definitely the highlight of the film.

He couldn't be further from the character I've read in the books if he tried, and Mycroft comes across as being just plain evil which contradicts his character in the novels. I also didn't like the fact that the mother of Sherlock Holmes is a wannabe terrorist. The whole thing is very like a lot of the movies I've seen that were made in the last few years where the main female lead is a Mary Sue and all the men are evil/incompetent. The colour-blind casting is also very jarring, particularly with Lestrade. The great character of Sherlock Holmes being lectured on white privilege by a black woman (in 19th century England?) was cringe-worthy.

Enola Holmes,"""Do I want to find you?"" . (40/100). ""Enola Holmes"" is the first film by Harry Bradbeer, who has an extensive career in television, and is written by Jack Thorne, whose greatest success was collaborating on the adaptation of the script in the film ""Wonder"" (2017). ""Enola Holmes"" is a harmless story that does too little to inspire and too much to entertain. The script is guilty of both, both for ""poorly representing"" a socially important purpose and for wanting to fill the film with equally poorly developed adventures. Enola's career is unfocused and she is given responsibilities that divert her from her own goal. Her ""new"" paths allow her to learn about her world and herself, but this results in Enola's autonomy being available to those less responsible. As if to say ""I'm smarter than you, I'll take responsibility for your problems"" (a somewhat irresponsible idea that promotes abuse). Anyway, this is disguised with a silent romance between glances in the most cliché way possible and eliminates any purpose of empowerment in the film. The ideologies of the other characters are so drastic that it does not allow for any debate. We will all agree to the same old thing. There's also an effort to point out that Enola doesn't know everything and that tries to add intrigue and maturity to the setting, but it really just creates a self-contradiction that overrides any lessons previously learned. Millie Bobby Brown's performance is therefore reduced to a meaningless character who likes to talk to herself, and Henry Cavill, Sam Claflin, Helena Bonham, Louis Partridge and Fiona Shaw don't provide or show any significant drive. The only visual effort, although not surprising, is the costumes. Neither photography nor music. ""Enola Holmes"" fails to attract the attention of young and old in this story, as this film is a monotonous distraction that entertains only inexperienced audiences. - ""Enola Holmes"" is the first movie of Harry Bradbeer, who has a long career in TV Shows, and is written by Jack Thorne, whose greatest success has been collaborating in the adaptation of the script of ""Wonder"" (2017) movie. ""Enola Holmes"" is an inoffensive story that does too little to inspire and too much to entertain. The script is to blame for both of them: for wrongly presenting a socially relevant purpose and for wanting to fill the movie with equally poorly developed adventures. Enola's trajectory is blurry and takes responsibilities that amuse her from her own mission. The ""new"" paths allow her to learn from the world and from herself, but this causes that Enola's autonomy to be at the disposal of those less responsible.

Enola Holmes,"I'm amazed this film is getting so much appreciation considering how weak its plot is. Especially its remarkable lack of development. I find it incredible (even considering the nature of the characters) the evident emotional detachment shown at the beginning of the story. Are you telling me that the main character is waking up on her birthday and her mother is nowhere to be found, plus she didn't say where she was going and she doesn't seem worried about it? There's a certain sadness in her tone, but frankly, she doesn't seem interested in her whereabouts. After that, she's reunited with her two brothers after several years without seeing them and they obviously don't recognize her, and she acts as if nothing is happening? And then the first real emotional reaction she shows is when she finds out that she's being sent to school? Who the hell wrote this? Now, I can't blame Millie Bobby Brown for that. At the end of the day, she does try to bring charisma to the matter, with her constant breaking of the fourth wall. However, everything that surrounds her despite seeming built with the intention of enhancing her character, it cannot help feeling ruinous and empty. Mycroft is a pain in the ass. He's mean and annoying. Whereas Sherlock seems to be so disconnected from everything, that he becomes completely useless. I fully understand that neither of them are characters that need an emphasis in this story, but it wasn't about disappearing them in such a way. The most ironic of all, is that Enola Holmes seems to be grappling with one thing at first and then changes its focus very quickly. Although its approach in tone is clearly lighter, that didn't mean that it should become so bland and this is because the script is very weak, this despite all the topics it tries to cover. Because the film is mainly an origin story, but it is also a family drama, a thriller with political elements, there's also the feminist commentary and gender roles, even reaching the fields of romantic comedy, and if your script is not so solid to complement all these elements, it is more than clear that there will be much to criticize. Apparently this film didn't get the message of: the one who grasps at too much loses everything. Maybe I'm being a bit harsh, but it seems to me that a lot of people decided to leave out many of their flaws. I guess this is because they enjoyed this story much more because it was a feel-good movie within the Netflix standard. And while it may be, I doubt there will be more talk about Enola Holmes beyond a couple of weeks from now. I was going to give it two stars. It won the extra half star because of the great production work and the musical score.","SEP 26, 2020",5,Mistery

Henry Cavill also does a pretty good job here too and I wish we got to see more of his take on Sherlock Holmes. The film is well shot but it doesn’t do anything creative with its shots and the production design, costume design, and score are all pretty good. Everything else however was definitely below average. The plot is fast which is nice but certain elements of the story are not engaging at points. The setups and pay offs are so predictable that you could see them coming from a mile away. The editing is very dull and rapid and there are some very obvious green screen moments here and there. I took a lot of issue with the 4th wall breaks. It felt out of place and awkward at many points and really ground the film to a halt when it happened. I know they need to explain some elements but it could have been done much better than that. Go check this out on Netflix if you are a fan of Millie Bobbie Brown or Henry Cavill or if you enjoy the universe of Sherlock Holmes.

M.B. Brown does a decent job but she's no Audrey Tautou, or at least the movie makes her look more like a caricature than a relatable character. Those are the good parts. The bad parts is a victorian London that feels like a trite stereotype from people who know nothing about it and, worse, not something Doyle would have wrote. Both Sherlock brothers are done wrong, especially Mycroft. I read all the damn books and this felt like some fanfiction written in America, especially the awful dialogues. Then, the cringy af feminism. Nobody herd that word in the 1880s and the only instances of modernity in Sherlock Holmes books are found at end of the series, 20 years later, when Queen Victoria dies and the characters realize the world is changing.

Enola Holmes,"I didn't finish this movie because I couldn't. It was not for the ""politics"" or feminism that I lament this movie, at least not entirely. I am glad that this film had a feminist message, but the feminism was ham-handed. Social justice is something that needs to be achieved still, and woman-positive media is a way to help achieve that. What was most reprehensible and anti-Holmesian was the fourth wall breaking; the direct speaking to the audience that was annoying and unrealistic and unnecessary. Also, The story was not compelling. The old ""what happened to character X that disappeared suddenly without a trace"" trope as the first mystery was boring. Furthermore, the use of clues was not typical of Sherlock Holmes. The deduction that Enola used was based on her personal knowledge of her mother, rather than keen observation, the deep pool of knowledge that Sherlock Holmes gains through reading, or his network, which Sherlock uses to solve mysteries. Indeed, Enola had no network because she was cooped up and home-schooled by her mother, played by an unoriginal and overrated Helena Bonham Carter. The relationship and age of all the Holmes doesn't make sense and seemed forced, although some marriages did start at a very early age for many young ""women"" in the 1800s. There's barely 17 years between Cavill and Carter and Mycroft is supposed to be 7 years older than Sherlock, so... mother at 10? Before the average girl's first menses? Please. Despite trying to be pro-woman, this film continued Hollywood's infantilization of women and cast an unrealistically young mother Holmes. They should have went with a older, more intelligent woman. Lastly, I thought Calvill's acting was wooden and dull. He didn't seem to be processing much in his head like a real Sherlock would. Of course, some of this is due to his writing, which made him to look inferior to the upstart Enola, because this movie is both anti-man and young adult fiction.

For real, I do not want to say: ""Ughh this is such a bad adaptation that's why it ****"" Real problem here is that in one point you realize this is a Netflix production so you can expect some forced topics. But that's not the real problem, and by the way, are we seriously going to forget that Helena's character was trying to make a terrorist attack? I though she was being framed or something but turns it was more real than I thought. After finishing the film couldn't avoid to think that, for real, there's no even way to justify that Netflix and Millie (Who produces this by the way) Henry is perfect, though he couldn't fit the role but he does, althought of course it's kind of a different version of the Sherlock we know, some changes but it's Sherlock. Real and HUGE problem comes with Mycroft, if he would've turned into the person behind everything this movie would have a large zero, lucky for us he is just a selfish who hates feminism. Mycroft in books it's almost smart as Sherlock is, but here they turned him into an stupid and annonying brother, in the end he is just that, nothing else, but come on, Sam does what he best can and that script they gave him it's stupid, when they made him yell during the trip with Enola, it was cringy, lame, I mean, they're really trying to make him look like the bad anti-feminist guy. Awful. And finally, Enola is smart, but she didn't solve the case. She went to the house with another idea, and she found the answer there but didn't solve anything. Sherlock did it and somehow she takes the credit, ALL the credit. And again, she didn't solve anything. It's fun to watch, it has some good moments but for real and I can't stop thinking about this while I'm writing. HELENA'S CHARACTER WAS TRYING TO MAKE A TERRORIST ATTACK! And they justify it with the fact that she was fighting for women rights. Really, can't stop thinking about this, but go on, watch it, not recommend it but it's not like it's unwatchable.","SEP 26, 2020",2,Mistery

Makes Enola Holmes essentially a superhuman who's looked down upon by her brothers. extraordinary large amount of exposition and uses it to skip over basically everything. 4th wall breaking is weirdly placed and stupid. Both Sherlock and Mycroft seem out of character, neither of them are calculated or seem competent in any way, the movie portrays them as arrogant and they become whatever the situation requires of them. Despite being the most well known characters, the Holmes brothers are half-baked and useless. Almost all the attention is placed upon Enola, but they still don't manage to build her up in a way that would make sense. In spite of what they want you to think, Enola Holmes isnt Sherlock Holmes The sheer amount of unnecessary scenes is astounding Mediocre pacing, most of it doesn't make sense in both a storytelling way and a logical way.

He's so beefed up and looks so out-of-place in early 20th century clothes. Cavill, which I adore, was woefully miscast. * The Holmes brothers are completely incompetent and useless. Sherlock looks like he's completely bored out of his mind and cba with the movie. * A women's only Jiujitsu club in central London, with an overweight black Sensei. SJW nonsense parade. * A 16 year-old skinny girl easily stands up to a 40 year-old bully and withstands A LOT of senseless beating, because when she was little, het mother trained her in the apple grove. * Movie gives a hint on women's suffrage, which is good, but it does it with a very cringy way.","SEP 27, 2020",1,Mistery

The first thing that turned me off was the way the narrative is handled - Enola talking to the screen/viewer and explaining every smallest detail left no field for any mind excercise. I just felt like the director thinks I'm too dumb to understand most basic concepts. The second and perhaps a key issue with the movie is its aggresive use of 'so called' feminism. Being aggressive towards men, constantly telling them that they are useless is not an act of strength, but of weakness. Is this the message we want to convey to our youth? That in order to be a strong woman you must believe that men are somewhat of a lesser being? Think no need to say that such a portrial of the main characters has little to do with any historical relevance. But this part I can forgive, as it is supposed to be just a simple 'feel good' movie. However, I cannot stand by the direction the movie takes with toxic form of feminism. True strength of a woman is in her kindness, empathy, love and care for others.

The New Mutants,"Overall, I liked it. I think Fox had a few misfires with the X-Men franchise, but for me this movie was pretty solid. I think the reason the reviewers are so hard on it is that this is a fairly small story on the big screen. X-Men movies tend to be big, ambitious affairs; almost the entirety of this movie takes place in one location. This would have worked better as pilot episode of a New Mutants TV series. This was supposed to be released in mid-2018, and then Disney bought out 20th Century Fox and the film was put on hold for two years. This ended up being the last of Fox's X-Men movies, which is a shame because I would have loved to have seen the planned sequels.","NOV 26, 2020",8,Mistery

The New Mutants,"After seeing it twice and processing what we got after two years I can safely say I really enjoyed The New Mutants. For starters, unlike the usual Marvel Spectacle we get it was nice to watch a superhero movie that was more about the character study of these young teens. Usually the X-men films have barely touched base with their characters and only get some of them right ( Wolverine) but here I found myself really connecting to these mutants and hoping for the best whenever the inevitable danger presented itself. Since Disney bought Fox we really don't know what ended up in the cutting room floor but for what i gather it must have been allot since the editing feels way off at times, almost like it's in a rush to get to Plot A to B in a matter of minutes. For some this might be where the movie falters but for me I enjoyed seeing what was coming next and being on the edge of my seat. The VFX look great and when the action starts it really delivers on mutant powers , however since they're budget was low you can tell they were very limited to what they can do, and for that I can't fault the movie for trying to overcome it's shortcomings. The actor that I will be most sad to see go is Ana Taylor Joy as problematic as she was written in the beginning i grew to love her as Majik and she embodied the character so perfectly it felt like she leapt of the comic book page at times. Maisie Williams did wonderful too , her scenes With Blu Hunt( Dani MoonStar) are the heart and soul of the movie and prove these movies can go beyond just the normal teen romance we're so used to. Feige take notes. Charlie Heaton and Henry Zaga do great work too , sadly they're very underused and i wish we had more time with them. As for the horror elements promised in the trailers , i mean it's there but it's not scary it's more surface level if anything , as much as i hate to admit maybe this movie could have done some reshoots to polish some scenes and add more creepy elements but for what we got i still liked it's too bad it was very quick. Being that it is canon to the x-universe there are some cool little easter eggs, if you've seen Logan you'll get a kick of what they reveal later on. So The New Mutants, the two year cursed film that was destined to never make it to the big screen. Is it worth going out to see ? if you love the characters and know the comic lore like i did you'll enjoy it or what it was but for the casual movie goer don't expect an action packed cinematic experience this is more on the lines of Dream Warriors meets One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest.","SEP 14, 2020",8,Mistery

Such as characters now are a different race with lighter skin. Illyana acts like a jerk and a racist making racist remarks. Illyana is loved by many fans of the comics. Good time spent character building and developing the history and personality if the characters. The actors and actresses did a good job!

I thought the writing was great especially the relationship between Dani and Rahne and how they touched on darker more serious subjects like sexual abuse towards children with Illyana and struggling with you religious beliefs with Rahne. The makeup and hairstyling was excellent especially on Maisie Williams, Anya Taylor-Joy, Alice Braga (especially the wound makeup from Rahne attacking her), and Charlie Heaton.

The New Mutants,"7.5/10 *MINOR SPOILERS* Although it has its fair share of problems i really ""the new mutants"" enjoyed the movie. I really dig the horror themes in it and, although now that CB movies are getting more experimental, for a movie that was meant to come out in 2018. New mutants would of helped paved a way for more horror themed comic book movies. Especially for the kid friendly MCU movies. some of the characters i felt really stand out. mainly the troubled illyana/magik and the smart mouthed roberto/sunspot but i felt like some defining that moments could of helped fleshed out these characters. A example could be illyana's past like what where those smiley demons and why did she kill 18 men? Sam/cannonball did fall flat regarding his presence but i did like how protective and friendly he was to his fellow patients/prisoners I really did enjoy Dani's and Rahne's relationship. yes i admit it did feel abit rushed and i would of loved to explore rahnne's religious upbringing in the movie, another missed moment in the movie, i feel like there relationship could of helped be a starting point for LGBT representation in marvel movies. especially in 2018 when representation was starting to pave way with phase three. (Marvel or Disney if your reading this saying a character is LGBT and only dropping a few throw away comments about IS NOT representation) This movie does have some good moments. Them being the chemistry and performance of the main cast, the horror themes (especially for a PG-13) and that final fight with the demon bear, props to illyana for being a major badass. Final Thoughts After the **** show that was ""Dark Phoenix"" I am glad that the Sony X-men-verse did end with something bold and new. While the movie does some flaws with its pacing and character arcs. I feel like this movie is a fun watch especially if your in the market for something that isnt too complex and easy to follow. Overall I liked the movie and hope that Marvel integrates some of the characters into the MCU, Mainly blue hunt as Mirage and Anya Taylor-Joy as Magik, or use dani and rahnne as an example for **** characters.

I did see some reviews where they felt the film was “rushed” but honestly I don’t know what you would fill the time with. The characters were fleshed out and each one showed a level of vulnerability and humanity that many films with longer run times didn’t do. I think people have become spoiled with MCU films and were expecting something within that realm. This film was meant to be an introduction as well as small and intimate, that way each character gets some time to shine but also isn’t bogged down with unnecessary exposition and mindless filler. The graphics I have to say were very top notch and clearly they spent their budget where it needed to be unlike other films with a much bigger budget and wasted it on horrible CG (cough Black Panther cough). The movie also didn’t waste my time with forced unnecessary humor and to me it worked in the films benefit because it made them feel more real. I also loved the link it had with another X-men film which made it feel that 20th century was going for an expanded universe which is a shame that it may never happen.

The New Mutants,"It's a possible logical perception, that the colour green is the colour of meanwhile. The meaning of meanwhile. It's a possible logical perception, that green is one of those colours of the meanwhile. Green appears early, in The New Mutants. Not only that, it appears as the unfolding of a brick wall. The meanwhile and openness are at one, in the beginning. Later in the movie, the open dies, and so does the meanwhile. They die together. Later in the movie, the green is cut out, and angles take over, and thus, percentages and mathematics in the latter part of The New Mutants are conscious. Deception is mathematics, and Dr Reyes is only deceptive once she is deceptive. (This is where I need to listen to myself, instead of going into the stream.) What I'm not looking for, is the art of structure; I'm looking for the franchising of philosophy (via angles, the early green hill, with the overtrees over it, the deadends of the institution, and the facial close-ups). Back to the green hill, that's seen and used early in the movie . . At the green hill, used by Dani Moonstar, the forthcoming is the terrifying - which is because the meanwhile is in cahoots with the green hill. The openness isn't the forthcoming, it is the green hill. Like a bar. The shooting down over the hill; it's a mirror to the bar philosophy, of The New Mutants. Specifically, The New Mutants is the story of bars. The 10 minute bars. Or, the 10 minute slots. They begin with openness and meanwhile being allies, to later on the revolution of angles and mathematics. The rise of mathematics; the rise of cynicism. Except, the beauty of angles have taken over, and become allies of mathematics, in order to protect the cynicism and deception at play. Morality doesn't just protect itself, it protects its antithesis as well. Whether you're just getting out of the shower, eating dinner, arriving at work, arriving at home, or reflecting on a Sunday, before the dreaded Monday, The Green Hill by Dani Moonstar and Illyana Rasputin supports the original X-Men movie, by Bryan Singer, and that movies' meta-theme of the unattainable female literary agent being the aristocracy that supports that movie. Despite all his efforts, to be another meanwhile in Sonic The Hedgehog, James Marsdens' Scott Summers in the original movie will forever be my Romeo (even if I am straight), a perception that traits of The New Mutants supports.

Add that to the fact that the characters are written in such away that they all feel cliche, yet the actors do portray there respective characters well, especially Maisie Williams who played Rahne Sinclair and Anya Taylor-joy who played Illyana Rasputin. However, good acting wasn't enough to save this film. In conclusion unless you are a hard core X-men fan who needs a movie fix than stay far away from this film.","SEP 7, 2020",5,Mistery
The New Mutants,"Okay Hollywood, no more superhero-horror movie hybrids. You had The Crow. You had the first Hellboy. You even had Blade 1 and 2. Unfortunately, every other attempt you've made at marrying these two genres together has proven to be pretty disastrous, and this latest effort is no exception. To be fair, The New Mutants does have a GREAT premise. Take a bunch of teenagers struggling with the unfortunate consequences of their newly awoken powers, lock them in a psychiatric facility with a doctor operating under the guise of wanting to ""help them,"" and then give one of them the ability to literally bring all of their fears to life. It's an borderline brilliant idea, but the execution is so awful that only occasional and very brief flashes of the excellence that otherwise could have been ever show through. The lead actress can't act, its most interesting character (Magik) is underdeveloped, and the way it transitions from serious moments to ones where the cast are behaving like you would expect a bunch of horny, damaged pubescents to out of nowhere leads to a lack of tonal cohesion between a lot of the scenes. It has all the right elements to be the perfect millennial/Gen Z cape-and-costume flick, but never gives any of them enough room to breathe causing to whole thing to feel more like a janky pilot for another inevitably disappointing CW show rather than a well-executed proof of concept. Case in point, these teens have some of the coolest powers I've seen in a comic book adaptation since Bloodshot, but they don't really get to use them outside of the admittedly exciting final battle. Each character is compelling and seemingly layered in their own unique ways, but aren't explored much beyond the surface level. The plot also ultimately ends up going nowhere as it saves the major developments and inevitable showdown with the real big baddies for a sequel that we now know doesn't have a chance of getting made. I enjoyed this movie the most when it was trying to scare me. It's actually quite effectively creepy at certain points. Things like the smiley face men made my skin crawl showing that Josh Boone could have some potential as a horror filmmaker should he decide to go further in that direction at some point in the future. Which makes his upcoming remake of Stephen King's The Stand have some appeal to me whereas it otherwise didn't. However, given how strongly Magik's backstory ties into this side of things it only makes the fact that they sidelined it all the more frustrating. Like Spawn, Venom, and so many others before it, the final entry in Fox's X-Men universe is a misfire. Largely because it squanders so many of its most promising aspects more than anything. I can't think of another film I've seen that fails to capitalize on or sometimes even recognize its greatest strengths in the same way this one does. Which made me walk out of that theater feeling like I had seen where things could have gone right and ultimately disappointed with what we got instead.","AUG 29, 2020",5,Mistery

That was the most ridiculous part of this movie. An hospital/research centre, run by one mutant. No personnel, no guards. Just plainly stupid from the start. The FX are pretty decent.

Young mutants are haunted/harassed by something in a mental hospital. The best parts are pulled from the X-men series in which mutants first find out their powers, typically represented effectively on screen. Most times these scenes are fun, but the special effects are a mixed bag, jumping back and forth from decent to cheesy. Most of the ensemble cast are relatively new up-and-coming stars such as Maise Williams (""Game of Thrones""), Anya Taylor-Joy (""The Witch/Queen's Gambit""), and Charlie Heaton (""Stranger Things"") but the acting is mediocre, and worst of all, they butcher whatever accent they are supposed to have (Irish, Russian[?], and U.S. southern respectively).

The New Mutants,"I had heard of The New Mutants a lot, and seeing how awesome it looked I thought I should really give it a try. On top of that it was even going to be a horror movie so a superhero-horror could be a fantastic combination (Unbreakable Trilogy, Brightburn - it always works for me). And now that I have just seen it, I feel betrayed to levels I cannot even comprehend. The above average rating that I'm giving this movie is only for the awesome visual effects. The CGI is very well done and the colour grading is on point. But that's pretty much it. The New Mutants is not even one and a half hours long. Normally I would have complained about it since I hate it when movies charge five hundred rupees and don't entertain us for even two hours, but since it was released digitally in the middle of a pandemic I will allow it, since it means I get more time to watch something else. However, this movie even lacks a plot. Not a cohesive plot or a good plot, but a plot itself. The only thing we get in the runtime is the exposition, kissing scenes, teenagers partying and occasionally back stories. In most of the scenes I would start laughing because of how badly the scenes were done. The acting is done very badly, especially by Dani, which is ironic considering she's the main character. Her only personality is that she is a Native American. Her backstory concerns that, her being bullied concerns that, her character development concerns that, and heck, the opening and closing speeches also concern that! The score is also very, very bad. There are so many 'scary' scenes in this movie which could have legit scared me if the background music and camera angles were better. And this movie had so many subplots which were never talked about. I guess there was supposed to be a sequel to this where this would have been talked about more, too bad. If you just remove the VFX this movie would become the worst in the X-Men franchise. One thing I really like about X-Men movies is that it can never be completely bad. I'd put this movie above at least Dark Phoenix and The Last Stand because of how good it looks. I read some reviews here and found out this movie had a lot of studio meddling, so I'd give it a benefit of doubt. Probably it could have been something better, but we will never know.","OCT 8, 2021",6,Mistery

I was left with the exact same thought process on the visual effects, not knowing if they were good or pretty bad. With the cast of pretty talented actors, at times the script just felt very flat. At times it seem like the mutants didn’t necessarily know how to use the powers and then all of a sudden just proficient with them.

Hopefully this won't be the last time we see this acted play Magik. She was really good. The other characters were portrayed fine, but Magik was the standout. Now that all the good stuff is out of the way, I can't help feeling that the story was just not worthwhile. Having the whole thing revolve around one character's manifestations got boring. I could not help thinking that the story would have been better had the focus been on the characters working through their differences and eventually coming together to figure out that they are being groomed not for the x-men, but some other evil purpose. Then battling that entity. This was set up and is part of the movie of course, but the story never explains who was holding them, who was pulling the strings and why. It just gets brushed aside.

The New Mutants,"The New Mutants was the last film in 20th Century Fox's X-Men franchise movies. It's a spinoff movie based on the comic/team of the same name and focuses on lesser-known mutants Mirage, Wolfsbane, Cannonball, Sunspot and Magik. The premise is simple ""Five teenage mutants undergo treatments at a secret institution that will cure them of their dangerous powers. Invited by Dr Cecilia Reyes to share their stories, their memories soon turn into terrifying realities as they start to question why they're being held and who's trying to destroy them"". I remember watching the first trailer and it was very interesting especially since it portrayed this movie as a horror x superhero movie which was something new. However, it had a lot of background development problems with Fox executives wanting reshoots to make it more horror causing a delay, Disney merging causing it to be in limbo, the coronavirus causing it to be delayed again. It eventually released 3 years after being filmed. The question is was this movie worth the long wait? Firstly, the cast is pretty good and deliver for the most part. They do a good job for what they have been given and are convincing enough in their accents and portrayal of their character archetypes. Additionally, the chemistry between the entire cast is good even when they are antagonistic against each other. Wolfsbane (Maisie Williams) and Dani/Mirage (Blu Hunt) are great in scenes involving them together and Magik (Anya Taylor-Joy) is charismatic and dislikeable at the same time. Secondly, the third act of this movie is pretty enjoyable to watch with its surprisingly good action scenes and good CGI. Seeing the characters powers are also visually fun to watch. It is also the first superhero movie to give a proper representation to the lesbian community and not in the dumb ""Star Wars"" way. Unfortunately, there isn't anything else to praise about this movie. The first two acts of this movie are so boring and extremely slow-paced. The first act has a lot of setups to introduce us to the characters and the director (Josh Boone) does this by having constant talking. It was just so mundane and uninteresting to the point that I was begging for something exciting to happen. There is a scene where all 5 of them decide to have fun by taking a lie detector test and it is so draining to watch. The main character Dani gives a monologue about some Demon bear that feels like it is going on for way too long. The second act starts to have things happen but when these things happen they only last 10 seconds before going back to some boring conversations again. The characters aren't great themselves as they are all cliche archetype. We got Dani whos the nice POV main character, the nice girl Wolfsbane and nice boy Cannonball (Charlie Heaton), the **** boy Sunspot (Henry Zaga) and **** girl Magik. They all remain these type of characters from beginning to end with maybe Magik somehow not being an **** anymore with no explanation. None of the characters has any depth to them and you barely know anything else about these characters as their past are not completely elaborated on. None of the ""surprises"" in this movie is even surprising as the story is entirely predictable. The antagonist is predictable and all the explanation for the things occurring in this movie are also predictable. The horror aspect of this movie is all in the second act and there are barely any of it which is hugely disappointing. Furthermore, they are not even that scary. The superhero aspect of the movie is not handled well either due to pacing issues and boring characters. It also feels like scenes are missing from time to time such as the aforementioned Magik personality change where one scene before she is frightened and then 15 seconds later she is suddenly a badass without fear. Potentially the reshoots were going to fix this but sadly it never happened. Overall, this movie is a gigantic disappointment. Even though the movie had a great and unique concept, it doesn't matter when the execution is poor. It's not a good superhero movie and it's not a good horror movie either. Thankfully, the movie is just 90 minutes and the third act of the movie can give you some enjoyment but there are better superhero and horror movies than this.","NOV 19, 2020",2,Mistery

Frozen,"Most of why Frozen is so popular is because of the song Let it Go. There was no benefit to changing Anna’s memory. That only confuses her about why Elsa is so introverted. It causes un neaded drama with the two during the castles public reopening. There was no foreshadowing for Hans being a villain. He has an affectionate look on his face when under the boat looking at Anna when no one saw him. He had no reason to act differently there if he didn’t love her. Then he tries to calm Elsa after seeing her try to push a guard to his death off the balcony, which makes no sense for her because she’s been trying to avoid hurting people the entire time before that. Then soon after she stops, Hans moves a trapped guards hand to aim at the chandelier. That couldn’t be an accident because Hans glances in its direction before aiming there. He wants Elsa dead so he can take her place, so it makes no sense for him to play nice and ruin a good chance to let her die by the guard shooting her, only to try to kill her a different way using the same thing. I’ve seen people say that Hans was changed to a villain late in the making, because Let it Go sounded too positive of a song for Elsa as a villain. Other sources say he wasn’t even thought of until they changed Elsa’s character. When Anna and her friends try to get Elsa to come home, she creates a snow monster to throw them out, knowing the risk of it’s aggression because later she sees him fighting the guards outside. If she could hear that, she could hear it screaming at her friends when it was in front of the closed door. That’s not a risk someone trying to avoid hurting people would take just to kick out someone you love. She hated isolation but then is happy when she isolated herself enough to sing like she’s triumphed over her problem, and has no plan to survive in the wild. She’s avoiding hurting people but there’s no reason she should be happy that she still thinks she’s a threat that should have minimal human contact. How was Frozen more popular than Tangled with critics? Tangled has a much more focused story and character chemistry. Gothel wants to live forever after discovering the magic flower. After it’s taken to heal the dying queen, Rapunzel is born infused with its healing power. To celebrate the queen’s recovery and birth of Rapunzel, a lantern festival is held. Gothel sneaks into Rapunzels room and discovers the power is in her hair, but won’t work if cut, so she kidnaps her. To discourage Rapunzel from ever leaving the tower Gothel raises her in, she always emphasizes the dangers of the world. The kingdom annually holds the festival on her birthday to hopefully guide her back home. Since no one likes being secluded, and because Rapunzel’s curious about the lanterns, she asks for a special kind of paint that will take three days to get. That way she has enough time to leave and return without Gothel knowing. There’s also a thief that finds the entrance to the tower when escaping arrest for stealing a royal crown. When he hides in the tower, Rapunzel knocks him out and refuses to free him and give him back the crown unless he takes her to see the source of the lanterns. Along their journey they have experiences that encourage them to tell more about each other and develop a romance. All the emotional moments and motivations are logically set up. Tangled isn't cliche just for being a love story. It's plenty original. Eugene's self awareness of Disney cliches is more subtle and clever than Frozens humor. None of the two lead characters fall in love until they learn more about each other on their journey. They don’t get married until years after the films events, as stated by Eugene at the end. The princess helps the man as much as he helps her and she saves the male. The moral is about trying to fulfill dreams and that there’s always more dreams to have afterward, which is a very inspiring and more applicable message people can relate to than Frozen. What’s odd to me is that professional reviewers liked Frozen more than Tangled. Rotten Tomatoes’s general consensus was: ""While far from Disney's greatest film, Tangled is a visually stunning, thoroughly entertaining addition to the studio's classic animated canon."" Why did they feel like saying it’s far from Disney's greatest film? The same sites consensus for Frozen was: ""Beautifully animated, smartly written, and stocked with singalong songs, Frozen adds another worthy entry to the Disney canon."" Why no criticism for the much more flawed film? Scott Mendelson on Forbes said: ""Frozen is both a declaration of Disney's renewed cultural relevance and a reaffirmation of Disney coming to terms with its own legacy and its own identity. It's also a just plain terrific bit of family entertainment."" How could so many people be so ignorant of how major the flaws in Frozen are and how well everything works in Tangled? Tangled restored Disney’s popularity, not Frozen.","MAY 14, 2022",7,Family
Frozen,"This film was slightly inspired in the children's tale ""The Snow Queen"" by Han Christian Andersen. Obviously, anyone who knows the original story quickly realizes that there is a totally new story, set in a fictional realm, geographically located in Scandinavia. The kingdom is ruled by a king who dies and leaves the throne for a daughter, Elsa. But she lives isolated by the fact that she was born with a gift that she is not able to control: she freezes everything in which she touches, including people. The one who suffers most is her sister, Anna, unable to understand her isolation because she is unaware of that power. The film revolves around these facts, and the relationship between the two sisters. The story is beautiful and really able to move the audience and make him identify with the princesses. Elsa is a strong woman, able to make decisions alone, in the style of the modern Disney princesses, whereas Anna is more affectionate, dependent and romantic, mainly thinking in her need to marry a prince. So we can see here the meeting between a modern Disney princess and an old-fashioned Disney princess. It's very interesting to look at these differences and see how the two sisters relate, as well as how they change and transform one another. And while there is an obvious male hero (Kristoff, a merchant), the film shows that he is the antithesis of a prince and princes may be the worst option. There are some script options that don't make sense and some of the characters' actions have no logic. Despite that, the movie works. One of the nicer characters is a talking snowman, magically created. This movie is full of magic, especially that which is provided by a good, dedicated and professional CGI team. The film has good visual and special effects, excellent animations and magnificent colors. The snow is bright, it looks fluffy and the ice is more elegant than a lot of expensive crystal I see around. Finally, we must talk about the awesome song ""Let It Go"", carried out by Elsa. Its very easily in the ear, joining to the extensive roll of iconic songs that Disney immortalized. In short, its an excellent animated film, designed for the whole family and not just for children. Carefully well done, especially in the more technical aspects, it has a rather functional history, despite some glaring flaws and illogical situations.","APR 28, 2018",7,Family
Frozen,"Frozen is a very solid Disney that I would gladly rematch even seven years later.

Frozen,"Almost everyone I know hates this movie and I can understand why, but I don't. Regardless, I consider this an okay movie, it's not Disney's best work, but it's not a bad movie by any means. The songs are great and serve a purpose to the plot (except for the Olaf song), so as a musical this is really good but what about the rest of the aspects like the animation, the characters, the writing, etc.? To begin with, the animation isn't that great. Sure the snow effects are nice but the lighting, textures and overall character animation are just okay and nothing better than what a Disney movie has done in the past, even when it was released in 2013 and I saw it for the first time I wasn't mind-blown by the animation or anythig. The plot is whatever, there are so many dumb things and plot conveniences that make the writing look lazy. Don't tell me that it's okay because it's a kids movie but let me tell you that there are tons of kids movies (and even Disney movies) with a lot of creativity in their stories and writing. The story is incredibly predictable (even the big twist that happens at the end of the second act is predictable and explaining why, will take too long to write) and it feels like there wasn't too much creativity or effort put in the script and the ""message"" behind this movie is corny and ****, it's a story about loooove. The characters aren't that well developed, the villain is incredibly weak with no motivation, the only thing I'm grateful with the character stuff is that Olaf didn't turn out to be too annoying as I expected and while he was annoying, it never made the movie ""unwatchable"", like Gurgi from The Black Cauldron. The only thing I liked from the writing is that, I don't know if it was intentional or not, but there were lines that feel that they were written for a Disney parody or something, some lines that are aware of the tired Disney formula (like when Kristoff said to Anna ""Who marries a man in the same day they met?"") that was one of my only big criticisms in previous Disney movies. Overall this is a decent movie, it's not Illumination levels of bad and annoying but it's far from being something to be named great or a masterpiece. Almost every aspect of this movie is pretty bland, except the music and songs, which are really good. Oh, this won an Oscar!? WHAT!? I know an Oscar isn't a way to determine the quality of a movie anymore but my god, in a year where Monsters University (that didn't even get nominated btw) and Ernest & Célestine were far superior movies, this was deemed the best!? I'm shocked.","APR 17, 2019",7,Family
Frozen,"A film that gives you everything you could want from a animated musical: catchy songs, a cast of colorful characters, beautiful animation, and to top it **** story of two sisters who in a way are foils for each other. Anna wants to open the gates so that she can connect with people, while Elsa wants to hide away fearing peoples response to her unnatural powers. Due to Elsa's attempts to isolate herself and push everyone who cares about her away she ends up pushing her sister to confront her which causes her to unleash her powers. On the opposite spectrum Anna's attempts to find someone to cure her loneliness results with her ending up putting her trust in a man who just wants to use her. In the end they find that connection with those who truly love you is good for all.","JAN 21, 2021",9,Family
Frozen,"When people speak of their favorite Disney movies, the big four of the Renaissance and films of the Golden Age of animation are likely to be mentioned. The past decade has seen Disney movies that were hit or miss. Some considered classics, some forgotten and some close to being classics but not there yet. Frozen changes this dynamic and creates a full fledged classic. Frozen IS not just a classic, it is THE Disney classic of the decade. It could position itself up there with the best of them. Disney returns to its roots with a vengeance. The best animated film of the past few years in my opinion. The story is heart melting, filled with the pure feeling and heart that has become a staple with the best Disney movies. It is a moving story that has family at its center. It is unpretentious in what it is trying to portray. The comedy hits right on the mark and the action packed adventure and thrilling journey make this a tale with a little bit of everything in the exact right amounts. It is a daring movie that is laugh out loud at the some moments and stunning and provoking at others. All achieved in balance. A true triumph in story telling that proves exactly what Disney does best and again proving that they are back to producing top quality films. This is an affecting human story, one that is significant. Startling and stunning, beautifully envisioned, emotionally powerful and relevant. Gorgeous visuals, stunning backdrops and intricacies like you have never seen before. The environments, the costumes, the character movements among other things make this film a gigantic step forward. The brilliant voice talents that breath life into this project need to be applauded and then some. The cast consisting of Kristen bell (Veronica Mars) and Idina Menzel(Wicked!)among many others bring winning charm, superior voice acting and magnificent vocals as well as heart to this tale. The sensational wit and humor, the arrays of different personalities, their emotions, their triumphs and falls make them some of the most interesting characters that people can relate to and some of the best i have seen in animation. The cast fully become the characters. The score and music is perfect. The score is grand. The sound, the texture, the harmony, the melody is in a class of its own. Above and beyond anything attempted by the animation studio in the past decade. I would place the songs up there with those of the 90's movies and 2000's Enchanted. A true all round musical triumph. Songs that will be stuck in your mind and you will be humming them and you won't even know it. And some you will be belting out at the top of your lungs because they are that good. Songs that progress the story and an essential part of it. So you have meticulously crafted breath taking animation, an affecting tale of the bond of family, romance, hilarious wit and humor courtesy of the characters especially sweet Olaf and heart stopping adventure. A true fairy tale that i would say could very well be The Little Mermaid or The Beauty and The Beast of this generation. FROZEN has that Disney MAGIC that has been missing for so long and it comes in full force here.","NOV 3, 2020",10,Family
Frozen,"From what I see, this is one of the best musical movies of all time. When I watch the movie, I really get into the story, and get addicted by the songs. I want to say that this is 'the' best original Disney movie of 21st century.","MAR 2, 2019",9,Family
Frozen,"As time goes on, I find myself appreciating this movie more and more. I was 17 when this movie came out so I was way outside its target audience even back then and I distinctly recall being irritated that these new children’s movies were getting so much attention in lieu of the older, “better” ones that everyone should be watching. Darn kids these days, am I right? But now, almost a decade later, I find myself looking back on this movie and realizing that this was perhaps one of the last, truly great animated feature films by Disney. It was everything you would expect from a Disney movie; a fairy tale adaptation with iconic songs, comedy, solid world-building, and that special Disney touch that most of their newer movies are lacking. Unhindered by modern politics or “wokeness”, Frozen’s only purpose was to entertain, and it did exactly that, enrapturing viewers of all ages all over the world and cementing itself as a true classic. It had soul. I imagine children who were below the age of 10 when this came out will probably forever hold this movie as special, the same way I might do with some of the late 1990s and early 2000s Disney movies. I just had to revisit this movie and raise my initial rating from 8/10 up to 9/10, because this movie is truly something special and there’s no shame in admitting it.","SEP 21, 2022",9,Family
Frozen,"Frozen is an animator who tells the story of two girls. Those girls are Anna and Elsa. I won't go into detail about what will happen to them to avoid spoilers, but I can only say that it's amazing. The animation is beautiful and the song Let It Go perhaps made the whole film famous. Other songs aren't bad, but there were too many of them and now a smaller spoiler. Especially at the beginning, where one of the characters runs to open the windows, I think it was completely useless to make a song out of it, but what. Otherwise, this is a great animator, which I recommend.","OCT 31, 2020",7,Family
Frozen,"Princess Elsa of Arendelle possesses magical powers that allow her to control and create ice and snow, often using them to play with her younger sister, Anna. After Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her magic, their parents, the King and Queen, take both siblings to a colony of trolls led by Grand Pabbie. He heals Anna, but alters her memories so that she forgets about Elsa's magic. Grand Pabbie warns Elsa that she must learn to control her powers, and that fear will be her greatest enemy. The King and Queen isolate both sisters within the castle, closing the castle gates to their subjects. In an effort to protect her sister from her increasingly unpredictable powers, Elsa ceases all contact with Anna, creating a rift between them. When the sisters are teenagers, their parents are lost at sea during a storm. Following her 21st birthday, Elsa is to be crowned queen of Arendelle. She is afraid that the kingdom's citizens might find out about her powers and fear her. The castle gates open to the public and visiting dignitaries for the first time in years. Among them are the scheming Duke of Weselton and the dashing Prince Hans of the Southern Isles, with whom Anna falls in love at first sight. Elsa's coronation takes place without incident, but she still remains distant from Anna. Anna and Hans develop a romantic connection during the coronation festivities, and he impulsively proposes to her, but Elsa objects when they seek her blessing. Hurt and confused, Anna protests, begging Elsa to explain her fear and isolation. The emotional strain causes Elsa to accidentally unleash her powers before the court. Branded a monster by the Duke, Elsa flees to the North Mountain, where she finally acknowledges her powers, building an ice palace in which to live a hermit life. In the process, her magic unintentionally engulfs Arendelle in an eternal winter. Anna ventures out to find Elsa and end the winter, leaving Hans in command. She gets lost, collecting supplies at Wandering Oaken's shop. She meets an iceman named Kristoff and his reindeer, Sven, convincing them to take her to the mountains. An attack by wolves leads to Kristoff's sleigh being destroyed. On foot, they meet Olaf, a cheerful snowman brought to life unknowingly by Elsa, who offers to lead them to her. When Anna's horse returns to Arendelle without her, Hans sets out to find Anna and Elsa, accompanied by the Duke's minions, who have secret orders to kill Elsa. Reaching the ice palace, Anna meets Elsa. When Anna reveals what has become of Arendelle, a horrified Elsa confesses she does not know how to undo her magic. Her fear causes her powers to manifest themselves once more and she accidentally freezes Anna's heart, seriously injuring her. Elsa then creates a giant snow monster named Marshmallow, who chases Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf away. Realizing the effects of Elsa's spell on Anna, Kristoff takes her to the trolls, his adoptive family. Grand Pabbie reveals that Anna will freeze solid unless ""an act of true love"" reverses the spell. Kristoff races Anna back home so Hans can give her true love's kiss. Hans and his men reach Elsa's palace, defeating Marshmallow and capturing Elsa. Anna is delivered to Hans, but rather than kissing her, Hans instead reveals that he has actually been plotting to seize the throne of Arendelle by eliminating both sisters. Hans locks Anna in a room to die, and then manipulates the dignitaries into believing that Elsa killed her, but not before they were married. He orders the queen's execution, only to discover she has escaped her detention cell. Olaf frees Anna, and they venture into the blizzard outside to meet Kristoff, who Olaf has revealed is in love with her. Hans confronts Elsa outside, claiming that she killed Anna, causing Elsa to break down and abruptly stop the storm. Anna spots Hans about to kill Elsa; she leaps in the way and freezes solid, stopping Hans. Devastated, Elsa hugs and mourns over her sister, who thaws out, her heroism constituting ""an act of true love"". Realizing that love is the key to controlling her magic, Elsa ends the winter and gives Olaf his own snow flurry to survive the warmer climate. Hans is arrested and exiled from the kingdom for his attempted assassination, while the Duke's trade links with Arendelle are cut off. Anna gives Kristoff a new sleigh and the two kiss. The sisters are reunited and Elsa promises never to lock the castle gates again.","MAY 24, 2020",9,Family

Unbelievable animation and CG, characters are so well done with just enough humor. I don’t love too much singing but the songs are perfect and catchy!!! The voice overs are right on the money. Great cast, no weak link. I just needed to hear Jonathan Groff sing more, he has a lovely voice. Loved the music and story line. I didn’t expect to love this as an adult.

Frozen,"Honestly, I have approached Frozen with great caution due to all the disgusting bad reputation it received when it was released, which was even disgusting to see Olaf and company even in the soup. I have found a good, decent movie, nothing more, with outstanding animation as Disney has accustomed us to but with a simple plot (I honestly don't know where the incoherent fame of Elsa, who is by far the worst character in the series, comes from. film after the prince and his sister devours it in every scene). Let us remember that this film has been the second in terms of characters that has generated the most money in merchandising after the famous mouse Mickey Mouse, which is saying something. The songs, well, passable, if it weren't for the hype that the world famous ""Let It Go"" received today it wouldn't seem like anything special to me either. Honestly, it's not a bad movie, but I feel like it's a step back after Tangled, 2010, which seemed much fresher to me even though it was of the ""princess genre"" with much more charismatic and less saccharine characters. Children (from what has already been seen) will love it and adults will be able to enjoy it just as much. Recommended.","NOV 6, 2018",7,Family

Everything had depth and you cared about the characters and their dilemma's. Then came the second half. Nothing made sense Everything was all around the place. One minute they said something and the next they said something completely different. Olaf was a terrible character and the movie was better off without him. He makes jokes at the completely wrong times. Kristoff and Hans were useless and the movie would've been better if Elsa was the villain and they would've had a better sisterly love message. Speaking of which there was no sisterly love. Anna and Elsa barely spoke to each other throughout the whole movie. There was no character growth at all, even though there had to be. They scotch taped the villain and the message to the movie, and overall the movie just got less enjoyable as we progressed.","FEB 16, 2015",5,Family

Frozen,"This was a fairly average movie. The animation was beautiful, but the plot and pacing weren't quite up to snuff. However, the biggest detracting feature was probably the songs, oddly enough - there were a LOT of them, especially towards the start of the movie, but they weren't especially good by and large, with only two which were really any good. It was a very nice idea for a movie, but the execution just wasn't there on it, and the first half of the movie kind of dragged. Only towards the end did it really start to pick up, but the fact that I never really identified with the characters in the movie at all kept me from really enjoying the ending all that much. Definitely not Disney's best, and I'm quite confused why people were so blown away by it - it was pretty, but nothing special. The LEGO movie, for all its silliness, was far better.","JUN 1, 2014",5,Family
Frozen,"Frozen is going to end up as one of Disney's movies that's really big for a good while it first comes out...then it will disappear into obscurity. Once the Let It Go flames die out it will too. Of course with that I will say it's not the worst of the worst, but it's not grand either. It's actually soooooo bad in the beginning that it's painfully bad. The first 20 minutes of the movie made me want to die a death so bad that Diablo himself can come and skip rope with my god damned intestines then make me suffer those beginning 20 minutes again. The only way Frozen got a 4 is that at least (when everyone is singing like morons and generally out of tune) it's at least enjoyable. Anna isn't enjoyable though...ever...ever...never. She is full of derp. Of course suffering through her complete inability to use her brain there is something under the surface of the ice. The story is at least intriguing. Given I don't see why you'd force your child to hide her super awesome ice control abilities. Especially when the rest of the kingdom seems completely fine with it by the end of the film. (No freaking clue there.) Also it did get hit by the generic Disney story of...""Ey, yo!! Yo parents done died foo'!!"" Which of course leads into exposition, which then leads into fourteen more pointless songs from people who can't sing and this is what drags down any fun you can have with Frozen. As stated before however...when everyone shuts the **** up, the story moves on and the movie feels fun. Until the next song. The songs in this movie ****. All of **** of this segment. The characters are all derpy idiots, the worst being Anna by far. I'm most assured she just recently learned how to breath through her mouth as previously she did not breath at all. The lame, generic, bad guy prince that Disney has been shoveling out like it's going out of style is just that. Lame...annnnd generic. Sven and his reindeer sex partner are also...pretty derp. Sven is less derpy then Anna and Prince Whatshisface but not by much. The only characters I honestly liked were Elza and the damned snowman. I **** stupid talking snowman more then the humans. That's pretty bad. There is a reason for this however. It is, to me, near impossible to ever get connected to a character who can only **** SONG!!! Therefore since the snowman has 1 song, and the rest of the time is him being funny, I kinda like him. I think I only like Elza for cool character design and the fact that Let It Go was in fact the best song in the entire movie, and it's not even that amazing of a song. The characters are near impossible to make any sort of human connection to. In the end when everyone is not singing terrible songs and being cliche as **** it's enjoyable. When they're doing what was previously stated, it's agonizing. Sadly most of the time they're being the former which just leaves for one big let down. Therefore I think for this movie we should **** it go. (Punny...I know.)","SEP 16, 2014",4,Family

She shows she already has major control when she freezes an entire kingdom and makes a castle out of ice. Wouldn't it have been easier to teach her self control? The snow man is the worst example, being there specifically for comic relief. No one really knows where he came from, even the Ice Queen is surprised the stupid character is ""alive"". Yeah, we get it, he represents their lost childhood or whatever, but there still wasn't any attempt to make this character any more deeper then a puddle of water. It's painfully obvious he was designed to sell toys. Frozen is bad, it's bad for everyone and I hate it.","SEP 25, 2015",0,Family
Frozen,"Seriously, NOT ALL PEOPLE ARE GOOD !!! I just do not understand why Frozen is so much praised by the critics and by the public, when not only is it a thing that is overexploited so much, but because the plot of the film, as the musical and characters, has many flaws. As in the worst argument to make Hans bad only because, yes, Anna has so much love for her sister Elsa with rescuing her, being that they do not speak for almost 30 years because Elsa was locked up by the danger of her powers, What a trip Anna's and Elsa's parents made, the bad planting of Anna and Elsa's relationship as a sister, that the trolls would help control the powers instead of doing silly things and putting Olaf in the story just as stuffing. Also the songs are forgettable and not memorable, because the only rescatable thing is that they go with the plot, but their lyrics are not endearing or memorable and stupid. The script is loose, cliche, not memorable and it shows that Disney did not take pains to create a good movie, but he did with the intention of selling goods like crazy. And that is the current problem of Disney, which now only knows how to overexploit its products so many times, even if that product is good or bad. And most are bad and mediocre. Few are salvables. Obviously the animation, the character design, the special effects and the music composed by Christophe Beck are very good. And that is undeniable. But what respects the script, the songs, the development of characters and the argument leaves a lot to be desired. We hope that Disney returns to do what was good before :(","JAN 25, 2018",3,Family

The story was pretty bad as well as somewhat confusing. This movie is a musical, so it's gonna have a lot of singing. But are the songs good? No. Not at all. I thought they were pretty bad to begin with, but hearing every single human being on this planet singing them all the time non-stop (especially the highest form of torture in the land, Let it Go) progressively made them worse. The only character I liked in this movie was Olaf the snowman, but even then I didn't like him very much. Now, there are two reasons this review is a 1/10 and not a 0/10. As Disney movies typically do, it had wonderful animation. And there was one scene I liked in this movie, that being the one at the trading post.

Granted it did say musical so when I finally sat down to watch it I forced myself to be optimistic thinking it might be like a typical disney musical which end up good (ex: Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, etc) but I was let down and if I could give a negative score I would. I have no idea how so many people like it but whatever. Although the animation is decent (it's pixar) and the scenery is nice those are its only saving graces and it's not enough. The constant singing by people who can't sing and the songs about nothing important are grating and annoying. In the opening sequence of about 20 minutes (there are three dramatic moments in this amount of time btw) into the movie there are 4 songs and only one of them should have been there. Due to being annoyed I can't find myself able to care about the characters and although I ended up turning it off after 20 minutes I am going to force myself to watch it until the end. I can tell right now however that the characters will be severely under-developed due to all the singing which will prevent you from getting to know them and feel for them. As for the story.... from what I've heard it's very bland and the supporting characters that have been introduced already are forgettable.... In short, I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless they're up for a bit of torture...especially if they're a musician as the songs compared to the normal quality of Disney songs are very poor and a major step backwards. Of course the whole thing seems like a major step backwards for Disney.","AUG 17, 2014",0,Family

Frozen,"Last Disney animated movie I have watched was already a long time ago. But always had good memories of Disney magical and musical worlds that they created. There was so much hype around Frozen and with the fact that they won 2 oscars with this, I finally put myself to watch it. Oh how I regretted my decision. The precious memory I had of Disney's magic was totally gone in an instant. Has Disney quality story telling really come down to this? Disappointed. Really don't know what the hype was about. It was a mess of a story with too many potholes. The Kingdom is portrayed as static as your typical Disney theme park. It had no soul, no atmosphere. The narrative of the story was rushed, you don't get any background explanation why Elsa was born with her powers and why others did not. The trolls saved Ana once, why couldn't they do it again, yes they said it was her heart this time not her head, which is a lame excuse, but okay. Besides, they misled her that she needed a true love kiss, which spun the story into confusion. If an adult finds it confusing, imagine how kids feel watching this? Talking about kids, the message of the story is not a good one for the kids. Ana was getting head over heels with the first man she meets (Hans), and then loving another man she meets even shorter of a time span than the first one. Crazy thing is she didn't knew she loved Christoph until her life needed to be saved. But turn out she doesn't need a mans true love to save her life in the first place. That was some crazy stuff happening right there, and it will send a wrong message to kids that fooling around with love is apparently okay according in this Disney **** if Disney says doesnt matter who you fool around with, as long as you find true love... Apart from the catchy song ""Let it go"" the queen Elsa really was not a memorable character. She was not coherent in her ways, indecisive and at times borderline evil and mental. Not a likable character. She was able to control her powers for all these years, and suddenly losing control over it doesn't make sense. Why doesn't Elsa push forward Ana to be queen, if Elsa was so afraid of letting people know her secret powers? And then the not so convincing silly plot twist where Prince Hans turn out to be this scheming evil person. Where it yet again send kids into confusing why this Prince charming seemingly turn into a bad person overnight. That is some lazy screenplay writing right there. Mess of a story, enough said. I would have given it a 0, but 1 score for the effort, that's about it.","APR 17, 2020",1,Family

Hugo,"Someone compared this movie to a Hans Christian Andersen tale and I think this is about as good a comparison as it gets. Some people find it boring and painful, others are mesmerized and inspired by the story it tells and the way it does so. In short, if you prefer Disney's version of the little mermaid story, you will likely be disappointed by Hugo. On the other hand, if you like the attention to detail and the not entirely happy endings of Andersen's classic short stories, you will probably find that Hugo is a captivating film that is hard to describe in a few words. It really lives in a lot more than three dimensions. If you also happen to be a cinema fan, you will love it even more. What is a cinema fan? It's person that appreciates films for more than just their entertainment value. The way movies are made, the different layers of audio, visuals, emotions, symbols, the photography, the standout supporting casts, the way you can predict the cliché moves sometimes, but love it anyway. We love the good movies, like the bad ones, and films like Hugo make our hearts sing. One last note on the use of 3D. I usually avoid 3D versions of movies because that feature has not yet proved itself to be more than just a gimmick. In Hugo's case, it is still partially true. I watched it in 3D and the opening sequence in the train station as well as a couple other select shots were exceptionally staged for 3D. Aside from that though, you get used to the effect and thankfully, it's the story that stays in the center of attention, followed by beautiful cinematography, characters, and 3D is trailing humbly behind. If you have the opportunity, watch the 3D version, but you will not really love it in 2D any less.","JUN 21, 2014",10,Family

Hugo,"When first seeing this movie I was in awe of the beauty it not only captures your attention but also your mind. I love that this film blends the past with the present showing the viewer how far special effects have come. this unlike many others can be enjoyed by the whole family and I mean that. Its not a cookie cutter family movie where the parents sit waiting for something interesting to happen with the suspense and adventure everyone can enjoy and go on a journey with the characters. I also love that Martin Scorsese directed a film that was unique from all his other films that are for a much more mature audience. This film uses sound to its advantage every chance it gets. I believe sound is one of the most important aspects of a film and in Hugo sound allows another aspect to draw you in, to suspense the next scene, to know when to look even more intently. The sound in this film was edited so beautifully it as if it is a part of the words blended into one solid piece of art. One does not go without the other. They work hand in hand and as one becomes silent the other is ready to take its place. Martin Scorsese did a wonderful job of incorporating sound throughout this film just like he does in many others like Cape Fear and Goodfellas. I love that the cast in this film is far from well known and all-star actors; I believe if this film had better known actors it would have detracted from the beauty of the story and we would lose the realistic aspect that Hugo is a boy living in a train station and that Isabelle is a curious young girl looking for an adventure. The cast really took their parts seriously and I believe that helped make this film what it is. The small characters were also quiet a big part of this film without all the side characters a lot of the story would be lost. If we didn't have an inspector we would lose a fair amount of the suspense and never have the threat of Hugo being taken away to the orphanage. The special effects in this film are my favorite part. They capture you with the past and the present showing how far we have come and the amazing changes that have been made. Including George Melies is the best thing Martin Scorses could have done because this not only give an amazing plot but also bridges the gap between old and new. By including some of Melies original work we see how special effects have transformed from the magicians hat to 3-D pictures. Last when Hugo turns into a robot you not only believe it but you start to think it could happen in real life and that is when a movie truly becomes a masterpiece. Overall I believe anyone can enjoy this film and recommend it to not just families but everyone. If you're looking for something a little less ordinary then watch Hugo I promise it won't disappoint. I must say if you can please watch it in 3-D but even if you can't it's still worth watching.","NOV 6, 2014",8,Family

Hugo,"Right from the onset of the film, it is entirely clear why it got so many Oscar nominations for its visuals. The visual effects, sets, and cinematography, are all absolutely gorgeous and this film absolutely qualifies as eye candy. On top of that, it is a fantastic look at film history. I did not expect that going in and while I knew some of what was discussed, it was still very cool to see it come to life in a film. In terms of the story itself, the film was very cute and charming as we follow the events that transpire for this kid living in the train station. The acting was also pretty good. There were moments when I had to pause and take in how bad they were, but for the most part, they did a solid job for being child actors. Ben Kingsley also turned in a reliably good performance. On the negative side, there is not much, but the aforementioned times when the acting was...less than sub-par. In those moments, it took me out of the film a bit. In addition, in the beginning, it is a tad hard to get into. However, once you are in, you are in for good.

Hugo,"Great visuals. Story a bit blocky and oportunistisc from a narrative point. Like, man, a lot of things fell into place pretty neatly. Would have been better served with a discussion on fatalism vs free will....then again this was sorta a kids movie. Marty got to geek out a bit while **** had fun with the old movies. A bit of a throw off too with all the British accents in Paris. Why pick only Brit actors? Why just not make in London with same plot?","MAY 15, 2019",8,Family

Hugo,"Martin Scorsese is my favorite director and this is my favorite movie from him. Everything about this movie is beautiful, it sad, it's happy, it funny, and fun. Hugo is very mature for a family movie, but that's expected from a director like Scorsese. This is a love letter to movies and being someone that loves movies I love this movie. It's in my top ten and I'm pretty sure it's always gonna be up there. I've seen this movie more times than I can count and I love it more and more every time. This is probably the only movie in my top ten that I can show my family so this is a very special movie to me.","JUL 21, 2019",10,Family
Hugo,"Martin Scorsese's love letter to film is near flawless, visually fantastic, and characters that connected very well to each other and the audience. The special effects were perfectly utilized and were tributary to Georges Méliès and his revolutionary special effects. This was Scorsese's first children's movie and possibly the work closest to his heart. It is a children's movie in that it made me feel like a child again, restoring wonder and marvel to the world of film and the real world at once. The movie also connects parallels between mechanics, literature, and film-making.","JUN 19, 2013",9,Family

Hugo,"Hugo: A film about cinema! Martin Scorsese did an exceptional job here. Paris, or in isolation: The train station, seems to have a life of its own. The set design and costumes are exceptional; The OST includes a lot of scenery and the photography is fascinating, especially at night. All the characters are very well situated, including their subplots. The film is very mysterious and deals well with what information we should know at each moment, keeping us very hooked. The conclusion of some characters, in terms of their story, is truly exciting, especially when it comes to cinema. Seeing the filmmaker's wife in his - so far - only remaining film brings tears to your eyes. All the elements coming together make the ending much more pleasant and congruent. I was just a little resentful about the inspector's ending, even though he found his partner and fixed his ""leg equipment"", it didn't seem like it had such an organic conclusion. However, otherwise, the film is impeccable.","MAY 25, 2020",9,Family

Hugo,"This is a family film which is mainly adventure and drama centred. It features themes including entertainment, film making as an industry, dreamers and carpentry. I noticed two things from early on, within minutes of the film starting - one being the beautiful visual effects or more generally the cinematography and the other being the quite charming and mostly Parisienne sounding music. Suffice to say, its quite an atmospheric watch - an immersive one at that. I do appreciate a good family friendly film, although im not always bothered by, or interested in, especially dumbed down kids films as such, just to make that clear lol but this film I enjoyed as I thought the plot was quite curious and it looked very much like a film that had been well thought out in advance. I found the main character Hugo Cabret, to be an intriguing person. There's a lot of mystery surrounding him and his background and I felt as eager as he was to try and learn more. I thought it was interesting that we see the films events almost entirely from his visual viewpoint, watching other adults bicker and laugh and otherwise in front of him while he cowers away in the gaps between the train stations walls. In terms of genre, I found myself thinking that the film reminded me a bit of the more recent Disney live action and CGI combined Chronicles of Narnia films. There is a definite innocence and Victorian style charm aspect to both a number of the characters (primarily the children, unsurprisingly) and the settings. Cast wise, Hugo is played by Asa Butterfield. He comes across as very naive, quite a nervous and yet also strong willed young boy, a bit of an Oliver Twist type, having to get by on the 'mean streets' or should that be the mean train station platforms?. He appears quite wide eyed and curious at times and I found him someone easy to feel sorry for and to hope the best for as well. Meanwhile, a shopkeeper who has dealings with Hugo is George Melies, who is played by Ben Kingsley and the station inspector (an unnamed character) is played by Sacha Baron Cohen. I'm relieved to say that he does tone down his usual over the top rude and slapstick character ways, as would obviously be the case for this being a family film(!). Other cast members include Chloe Grace Moretz as Isabelle, Christopher Lee as Monsieur Labisse, Helen McCrory as Mama Jeanne and Ray Winstone as Uncle Claude. It was interesting to see both Ben Kingsley and Ray Winstone in a non-violent film but then of course the same can be said about the fact that the director is none other than Martin Scorsese. Although, I should probably add that the film is based on a book by Brian Selznick. As mentioned earlier, I really liked the music present in the film. There is a nice mix of fairly light classical music, orchestrated pieces a bit like what you might hear in a Harry Potter film or something similar, other family/fantasy films of this ilk. There are also some nice continental, Parisienne sounding pieces which I enjoyed. Content wise, there's little to mention really, other than a couple of brief scenes which imply threat or peril and may mildly frighten young viewers. The film also include some black and white silent film clips, which portray instances of comic violence and threatening moments. Otherwise, the only thing worth mentioning is that some characters are shown drinking or drunk. There is a sad part/aspect to the plot but its unlikely to overly frighten kids, as although war is mentioned in historical context, nothing graphic is shown. The film has been given a U rating, although interestingly its given a PG rating in the USA due to some mild thematic content and some peril, which surprised me a bit as I'd have thought the US would be more likely to give it a lower rating but there you go(!). I liked that some of the dialogue is provided by voice over/naration, giving it a more authentic feel of a story come to life in a sense. It is very much a cinematic film, if that makes any sense - it seemed to me that there's been a lot of money and thought put in to it and it certainly impressed me. I particularly like the fact that it didn't in any way seem patronising towards the children, the younger characters and the relatively young target audience. Both adults and kids will likely find things they enjoy about this film and its fairly rare these days to find many films which work well for both young and old. The directors love of films and film making comes across brilliantly. Now, can I genuinely, hand on heart, say there are no potentially downsides for some people? no, as there are. I felt a bit confused/muddled by the plot at the very end - I wouldn't say it has a bad ending but there are one or two twists and I found myself feeling confused about quite how some of the plot elements ended up the way they do. Also, it does feature a fair amount of sentimentality, which won't appeal to everyone but I didn't feel it was far too over the top.","NOV 19, 2021",9,Family

Hugo,"Not often does a film truly find its feet when its basis and plot is, well, film. Hugo centres on the extraordinarily rollercoaster life of the title character, adapted from the book ""The Tale of Hugo Cabret"", we see this small boy (Asa Butterfield) living within the walls of the Gare Montparnasse train station in Paris in an early 1930s France. Hugo keeps the clocks running within the station, unbeknownst to everyone else. We soon meet the brilliantly diverse Sir Ben Kingsley, who really catapults himself into the role of toy stall owner 'Papa' Georges, named so by his goddaughter Isabelle, played by the coming-of-age Chloë Moretz. With a rather humorous supporting role from Sacha Baron Cohen as the station inspector, and brief appearances from Jude Law, Richard Griffths, Ray Winstone, Christopher Lee, Helen McCrory and Emily Mortimer, this has an ensemble cast which are used to their fulll potential. The cinematography at work here is truly beautiful, from the fluid motion of the train station walls to small pieces within Paris, the visual effects truly are spectacular, from the set pieces of the train station to the hand of the large clock. Perhaps the most enjoyable part of this film is the emotional rollercoaster that Martin Scorcese takes us on. This could very well be his most heart-wrenchingly beautiful film to date, he appears to have poured moments from his own life into the 120+ minute ride. With the history of film and moving pictures at play here, it truly is a trip down memory lane for some, but a valuable and entertaining history lesson for most. My pick for the stand alone performance has to be Sir Ben Kingsley, he soars to a different height in his diverse role as a down on his luck old man, I could really watch this man all day, everyday. The nostalgic setting and era used as the backdrop for the film is spot on, providing glimpses of the fast paced motion of technology in the early 20th Century, in particular the automaton, a glorious addition to this tale, one which sets in motion the basis for the film. Hugo is quite simply a must-watch film, superb acting, wonderful effects, a riveting and thoroughly entertaining story that really is suitable for all ages, see it to believe it!","JAN 3, 2013",10,Family
Hugo,Best cinematography of all time not to mention crazy visual effects. I thought this movie would have action but instead it had mind blowing screenplay and adrenaline pumping suspense.

The came close to being the first movie that i paid for in years that I simply walked away from 2/3rds of the way. But I wanted to review it fairly on Metacritic so I sat through the whole thing.

Hugo,"I went in looking forward to seeing this movie and hoping it would be another Scorsese classic. I'm a big fan of Scorsese's past greats, such as Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, and Good Fellas - and the idea of him doing a children's movie was intriguing to me. I left the theater with a **** reminder that, as great as Scorsese is, he's only human and even he can fall into the same trap that so many directors fall into when making big budget visual films; so much energy is put into the visuals that the story and characters get left behind. This movie is no exception to that sad Hollywood norm. The characters are lifeless and wooden, the dialogue is far too on the nose, and the plot is so slow moving that it trips over itself. The music is annoying and far too omnipresent. Instead of being used to heighten a mood or intensify a feeling, it's just constantly in your face. It's so superfluous that it loses it's meaning and impact. There were no humorous moments. I didn't laugh once. Sacha Baron Cohen is a lifeless, boring Station inspector and doesn't compare to other great children movie bad guys, such as the child catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang or Gene Wilder in Willy ****. From a visual standpoint it is a stunning movie. The best 3D movie I have seen. It makes Avatar look wimpy. Clearly Scorsese put a tremendous amount of thought into the visuals created each scene for 3D. But I think that is actually where he went wrong. He focused so much on that aspect that the story and character went dead. There should have been two directors on this movie - one for the visuals and one for the story. That might have created what I was so hoping to experience when I came out tonight. I really wanted this to be great. But it was just average.","NOV 22, 2011",5,Family

Hugo,"Hugo tells the story of young Hugo Cabret and his journey to try and find a message from his late father. Scorsese uses great imagery with vibrant colors to throughout the film giving the entire film a bright and hopeful view on life. However in spite of this view of a brighter and ore hopeful life the colors sometimes distract, finding yourself looking more at the old and attractive architecture in comparison to what is occurring on the screen. The story of Hugo is a roller-coaster of ride where at one point the story is just but Hugo trying to find a message from his father after his tragic loss. Then the story quickly adapts to a journey of discovery and to rekindling people's dreams. Sacha Baron Cohen is hilarious in this film, from his in chase scenes to his failures at attempting to secure a lover. Cohen plays the simpler minded police officer whose confusion in conversation is leads to bags of laughter. Moretz delivers an incredible performs as the twelve year old, Isabelle who lives to read the great novels of the day and who is already up for an adventure. However despite the strong performances from the entire cast the film Hugo fails to keep the attention of the audience, apart from the funny Cohen or strong lines of dialogue delivered by an incredible cast can’t bring the film back from the rather dull narrative that is the plot of Hugo. Unfortunately a film that had so much going for it, an incredible cast, director and writer. The film fails to entertain past the usual slapstick humor of a children’s film. Despite this the visuals of the film is stunning which I suppose is an upside if you aren’t easily distracted by grand architecture then this will be a major upside to your cinematic experience. In hindsight I will remember Hugo but not for it’s narrative I will remember it for it’s stunning visuals and superb acting, but I do not think that this is a film which I will remember with fond memories or frankly even remember at all. In hindsight this is not a film I would likely watch again. I would like to reiterate that my score is nothing against the acting. Moretz and Bohen were great. My score is more against the story and the general feel of the film.","AUG 18, 2013",5,Family
Hugo,"Any film directed by Scorsese is automatically awarded a place on my 'must see' list. I was somewhat dubious about Hugo, but went along anyway. My views on the film are mixed - I'd say it had high aspirations, and occasional flashes of brilliance, but ultimately it fell short for me. The story was functional, and it had some moments which bordered on the profound, but the plot was somewhat mechanical (like the subject matter) and ties between various elements were wafer thin such that the conclusion was not as satisfying as it could have been. The environments and the cinematography were beautiful throughout, but the pacing was a bit off - leading to several patches were I was bored (and feeling guilty for being so), in spite of the beautiful visuals and breathtaking recreation of a bygone era. Sir Ben Kingsley was magnificent - as was the cast generally; although the young lad playing the lead was sometimes annoying for me. But the most disappointing aspect of the film for me was where it crossed the line between plot progression and telling a story into the realm of self-serving indulgence. Film critics will lap it up given it spends a great deal of time lecturing the audience on events of historical significance if you are a film buff. The film tries to weave this into the story by tying it to the characters but it comes off forced and grating. Would I see it again? No. Would I recommended it... probably not.","JAN 11, 2012",5,Family
Hugo,"I wonder how Roger Ebert feels about this movie? He has trashed the 3D format for years and now his favorite director, Martin Scorsese, has made one! Unlike Ebert, Scorsese has totally embraced 3D technology, as the 3D is the star of this film. For me, the movie would have been a failure without it. It is the best non-animated 3D I have seen in the theater, and nearly all scenes were filmed with the format in mind. The opening shot of the camera moving through a crowded train station is fabulous. It's a great looking movie. Unfortunately, the movie's plot and story did not match the visual delights for me. This is a slow, plodding movie, lacking humor, saved only by the visuals. Unfortunately, I just didn't care about any of these people, and the dialogue seemed stilted and unnatural in parts. I can't imagine a kid keeping his attention to this film. The little boy just seemed devoid of personality. Not sure I ever saw him smile until the end of the movie. I rate this film a 6 in the theaters, but only a 3 or 4 at home unless you have a 3D television.","NOV 29, 2011",6,Family

Hugo,"This is was an interesting one, though something was highly questionable about it. Hugo was a very meaningful movie that gets into the heart of the characters and the meaning of cinema itself. Any movie buff should see this, as its a testimonial to the history film making and film preservation, which is evidently very important to Mr. Scorsese. This is one of Scorsese's most technically lush films, boasting exceptional art direction (which needs an Oscar), nice cinematography and some decent costume designs. And finally Asa Butterfield did well and the supporting players were all good, particularly Chloe Moretz (as usual) and Ben Kingsley. With all that said, something that I genuinely questioned was the true quality of the movie's screenplay. It was very unbalanced, and the first half was a quite drab (despite having an interesting premise). The movie could have definitely used a a serious rewrite, but overall it was a good, and well made film.","DEC 18, 2011",6,Family

Hugo,"Hugo is directed by either Spielberg or Scorsese. I think it's Scorsese, but it felt like Spielberg. The film even had some John Williams-style big music, composed by Howard Shore (yeah, that's right! the saxophone player from the band Lighthouse!) This fantasy is about a boy who lives in the walls of a Paris train station. Not since The Legend of 1900 have I heard of anything this screwy. Inside these walls are the guts of the station's clocks. The guts consist of cogs, gears, counterweights, pinions, springs, and inexplicably steam. During the course of the film, we learn that Hugo is the dude that built C3PO (or some C3PO prototype). C3PO reveals to Hugo that the local old grump (played by Ben Kingsley) is in fact a forerunner to movie wizards like Spielsese or Scorberg. Anyway, I saw this movie in regular old boring 2D. I didn't realize it was a 3D film until the scene where some pages with drawings go flying from the kids' hands and drift all over the screen. At first I was thinking, ""What the hell is this all about? Am I supposed to be mesmerized by fluttering stationery?"" Then I realized that this was intended to be seen in super-duper 3D. ""Ahh,"" I thought, ""Now I see. Ooooh, that would have been so cool to see all that paper flying around in 3D."" We haven't witnessed anything like this in cinematic history since the famous bolo-bat scene in the 1953 film House of Wax. Hugo does a lot of hiding and running, primarily from a train station cop played by Sacha Baron Cohen. Cohen's character is an amalgam of Inspectors Javert and Clouseau. He and his trusty Doberman Pinscher cannot seem to track down the elusive boy who knows the station and its walls like the inner workings of an automaton. During one climactic scene, Hugo gives the Inspector the slip by doing a Harold Lloyd impression from a clock tower. Once the Inspector catches up with Hugo, they have a talk. During the conversation, the little urchin makes the Inspector laugh. The Inspector tells him that he's funny. Hugo then says, ""I'm funny how? I mean funny like I'm a clown? I amuse you? I make you laugh, I'm here to f____n' amuse you? What do you mean funny? Funny how? How am I funny? What the f__k is so funny about me? Tell me, tell me what's funny!"" Wait a minute. I might me confused. That dialog might be from a different movie a real Scorcese film. All in all, Hugo isn't such a bad movie. But in retrospect, I think I would have preferred watching the Harold Lloyd film, Safety Last.","APR 24, 2013",5,Family
Hugo,"This movie is beautiful to look at, has a good cast among the adults, and has some nice moments with the train station setting. But the plotting and pacing kills it. For one thing, the two plots seem to be forced together in a non-credible way. That may be the fault of the source material, but a good director ought not to reproduce strained plotting out of some sense of faithfulness to the text. It was just too abrupt for me the way Hugo is all about the automaton and then suddenly he's all about movies. Too much coincidence, not well integrated. Then, there are two places where the movie basically stops for a lecture about film history. Nothing against the topic, but voice-over to explain it is a poor dramatic technique in a non-documentary film. Finally, the secret behind Papa Georges' reaction to Hugo's notebook and to seeing his old drawings didn't have sufficient dramatic heft. ""He went bankrupt because tastes changed"" is sad, OK, but hardly the tragedy presaged by all the preceding build-up. He didn't change with the times so his studio failed. This happens all over in every industry. I was left with a big feeling of ""Is that all there is?"" He seemed pitiful (and self-pitying) rather than tragic. I realize we are meant to view the melting of his films as an awful warning about preserving the classic films we know and love, but the point was laid on with too heavy a hand. Besides all this, the screenplay was uneven, sometimes awkward, there were too many extraneous bits such as the bookseller and the wicked uncle, and the pace was very slow. All these factors kept me from becoming fully involved. I can't imagine a child having the patience to try to follow this. In short, for a movie about the magic of movies, there just wasn't enough magic.","DEC 26, 2011",5,Family

Watching at home, without 3D, the movie falls flat. A movie should have been made about Mr Melies but this is not about him, but about things that fly off the screen. And what's the story with the dust or snowflakes that drift around the entire film? Is everyone in a snow globe? Is this Dr Suess? Disappointing on so many levels. The director needed long explanations about the characters, their families, the evil cop, etc. instead of ""showing"" us some background-this is a visual medium. The best part of the film is the flashbacks on how movie making got it's start. Now that would make a good film. Mr S should get back to developing strong characters, fierce relationships, and de-emphasize the SFX. Poor outing from a usually brilliant director.","MAY 9, 2012",4,Family

The acting is perpetually bland, the effects were underwhelming, and the story isn't as endearing as several other 2011 releases. Hugo is not a bad film, and I do enjoy some moments. But when people cite Hugo as a year-defining film and an instant classic, I can't help but disagree. Hugo is a decent family movie, but does nothing new or inspiring other than glorify Hollywood. In the end, it's a sweet and simple appetizer for all the delicious cinematic entrees 2011 had to serve. 6/10 Follow me on twitter. @cbeers2513","DEC 3, 2013",6,Family

You want us to believe your opinion, but then create such ridiculous reasoning for other opinions as if their opinion were wrong, the movie expresses love for other movies, therefore, that is the ONLY reason why the critics gave it a high mark? Preposterous. That is not a sane justification of any hypothetical. These people think they know better than movie critics, Your opinion of this movie, although unexplained well and improper, is not relevant to my point, the bitter assumptions of why critics gave this film a high mark is relevant to the point. Hugo, a film about fixing people, unfortunately, the message was not received. People saw the film, but they did not truly watch it. There is plenty of effort found in this movie, it has so much heart and beauty. The small minor details are not important, it is a very kind film that does not deserve such arrogant rhetoric.

The subplots were annoying especially Cohens cop and the romance between the couple near the cafe, they provided nothing to the story. I understand that after watching this film it is supposed to be a love letter to film making, but this was definitely an obtuse and annoying way of expressing it. The only saving grace from this film is Ben Kingsley performance. I have not seen much of Scorsese films, but I have to say this one is the worst one I have seen.

My favourite is Taxi Driver, followed by Good Fellas, Departed and even Shutter Island wasn't that bad, like some people say! So I just thought, I have to watch 'Hugo', because it's a 'Scorsese', although I don't really like fairy tales and stuff like that. Now, after I saw 'Hugo', I have to say that the movie is not so bad, but really not great! I also don't understand, why this movie is nominated for 11 oscars! Is it because Scorsese was the director?! Well, about the movie itself: the effects were great (not too much or less, but just right), the story was half interessting, half boring, the actors were partly good (Ben Kingsley), partly bad (Asa Butterfield, the innocent looking acting-noob) and the runtime was way too long! It really needs more than dirty hands and baby-blue eyes to play an orphan quite authentic! Asa was much too whiny... Also there were way too much 'coincidences', like the girl carrying the key as a necklace (of course...)! All in all I would say take another child actor, wrap up the story a little bit, shorten it and show it again. Otherwise, it's not worth an oscar!","FEB 25, 2012",3,Family

This movie looked cool, and i can tell it was meant for 3D in the theater, but other than that it was not very good. The plot is so very slow moving that you think it has to lead up to some big climax of how all the mixed story lines tie together, but it does not. I still do not understand how that was supposed to flow well at all. The Automaton had so much potential to be entertaining, but actually had very little to do with the story. It all was very coincidental and the story of Hugo, his dad and the automaton and the story of the movie director didn't quite flow together, heck the Automaton doesn't flow with the director. How would it draw images of his movies if he took it apart to make his camera before making any of his films? Why did he fake his death or why do people think he is dead? What happened to Hugo's mother? Over all the movie left many questions unanswered and was not a fantasy adventure story that the previews made it out to be at all.","JUN 10, 2012",0,Family

Hugo,"I was almost shocked by the stream of 100 reviews by critics, which the more I think about the less I like. I'll try to be fair and line up the points in its favour first then more onto the more disappointing. In its favour, Hugo carries a strong cast with (albeit brief) roles by Jude Law, Christopher Lee, the pleasantly surprising Sacha Baron Cohen as well as the superb Ben Kingsley and Annoymous Child Actor with Sparkling Blue Eyes. Y'see, I've already slipped into the negative because there's so many of them. Director Scorsese doesn't seem to be able to focus on Child Actor with Sparkling Blue Eyes (hereby referred to as CASBE) without an overly long and rather blunt focus on his sapphire blue eyes. Thus starts a long stream of the film throwing what it wants you to think in your face in a blunt and unconvincing manner. He's an innocent child, it screams, can't you see that, in his blue-blue eyes! Ahem, back to the good. The setting of the film is spectacular, beautiful even. We are pleasured optically with panoramas of early 1930's Paris bedecked in a powdering of snow, lit in the evenings by twinkling lights and a few obvious landmarks like l'Arc de Triomphe, the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame, just to make sure you're absolutely sure it's Paris because amazingly NO-ONE, except Christopher Lee's line ""Mousieur Cabret,"" sound even remotely French. Okay, we can forgive that, back to the good things. A lot of money has clearly been put into backdrops and extras; the train station in which most of the film is set is bustling with hundreds of Parisian folk about their business, crushingly busy at points (like during chases) but fortunately empty at others (like when extended dialogue takes place). Maybe Parisian's were more polite in the 1930's than they are now. There's a few moments that may make you laugh, mostly with comedy relief Cohen, but they were few and far between for me. Right, is that the good stuff done? Recap, imagery, some actors, a few laughs. So much for Hugo as a good film, now for it as a monster.... The film's so God-awfully slow as to be painful. In a world of high octane films that demand attention through sheer eye popping explosiony goodness, it's nice to slow the pace, it really is, but not this far. I was bored by mid-way, checking my watch for the first time in a film in years. Each scene is staggered out with long dramatic pauses that drag on and on. My hopes were high in the extended introductory scene where a chase with Cohen, the unlikable and awkward station inspector, pursues CASBE through a throng of Parisians. Just as I'm thinking ""ooo, this is fun"" WHAM, it slows down again to a snails pace and becomes brooding and dark, which gives me another impression; this films doesn't know what it wants and so has a pot shot at everything. Rather than stick with a theme, it veers chaotically from tragic, comedic, philosophical, romantic, like it's on a runaway locomotive ploughing into a Parisian station.... The thing that annoyed the most, beyond the agonisingly slow pace and the butterfly plot, the thing that really got to me more than anything was how demanding this film is. Now I don't mean demanding in terms of complexity, God no. I mean demanding in what it asks of you in a manner almost as petulant as CASBE when he follows child acting school rule 17, ""Act Shocked When Accused"" and snarls that he's not a thief when anyone even vaguely implies a five finger discount being taken. This films DEMANDS how you feel about characters while providing so little background to them that to call them two dimensional in within serious risk of being overstating them. He's an orphan, roars the film, you HAVE to feel sorry for him! He's a sad old man, can't you see that? Aren't we making it clear enough how you should feel!? Every character that we are meant to empathise with has so little back story, or such a limited back story, that it makes it almost impossible to feel anything for them. The backstory that pads out Kingsley's character is given in one large chunk right at the end of the movie and I actually found this quite engaging as it allowed me to appreciate the character I wasn't allowed to feel anything for. Every time another character tries to peek into the bubble each character has around themselves they're rebused with almost the same petulance as CASBE along the lines of ""I don't want to talk about it"". The only character that gave any inkling into their motives was surprisingly the unlikeable Inspector, Cohen offering the touching line almost as an apology of his disability to the girl of his desires. In that brief conversation more was giving about one character than most of the others in the entire film. In short, appalling pacing, almsot non-existent character development and a waste of good actors do not make up for pretty settings and facing graphics. Let's not even talk about the 3D.","DEC 2, 2011",3,Family
Hugo,"A visually-stimulating eye-candy that got lost in a cornfield in terms of storytelling. I wanted to see more of Hugo's growth and his relationship with his female friend after the death of his father. I also wish there was more to the Automaton (sp?) than just showing that Ben Kingsley's MÃliÃ¨s is still alive and well. MÃliÃ¨s's creative approach to film-making was a side-plot that somehow overruled the whole story after thirty minutes in, and I feel that the protagonist position shifted to him rather than Hugo as well. I agree w/ awhubsch that the critics may have loved this because it shows some film history, but the movie itself has too much airy, half-hearted acting (anyone could immediately tell that Asa Butterfield didn't know a thing about fixing things by the way he touched and handled the parts of a contraption) and badly developed characters - as well as many redundant ones. What exactly was Isabelle's purpose after her key was known to fit into Hugo's father's machine? It's like she became a smiley prop object or something. I feel that Hugo was just a mouse running on its wheel continuously and that somehow got lucky.","DEC 5, 2011",3,Family

Hugo,"I am a fan of some European films, and can find interest in old movies, but this was barely engaging at all. The train station and artistic detail is lovely for the first 20 minutes, but after that, we are led mostly nowhere by tragic characters who speak very little. The intense focus on mechanical things and all these supposed French characters acting bitter and speaking with British accents made it seem like a post WWII British engineering education film. Not deep or well-scripted enough for adults, too dreary and slow for children, it mainly was an equal-opportunity aggravation. Why the critics are swooning about this, I can't imagine.","MAR 5, 2012",3,Family

Yes, it's beautifully shot, but we go to movies to see ourselves through the characters portrayed. If we only wanted beauty, we could go to the beach, or a park. The filmmaker (George Milies) in the film became a has-been because once the novelty of moving pictures wore off (a train! Special effects!) the audience craved rich, complex characters overcoming seemingly impossible odds to acheive their goals. The Director of Hugo forgot that. It's much much easier to criticize than it is to create a movie start to finish. And yet, we as Scorcese's audience deserve to see him use his awesome power and budgets in the service of great characters in a great story, and not in talking down to us.

Like I said earlier. The girl just HAPPENS to have the key hanging around her neck. All the girls in the world and he hooks up with the one who chooses to wear it as a neckelace. 4. Way too long. 30 min would have been too long. 5. Was this fantasy or not? Robot that draws all this is unbelievable. Why were the papers flying around when the box dropped? Why was the grandfather so upset when the kids found the box of drawings? Why was he so upset about the book the boy had with the drawings? (another stupid super coincidence). He was just too darn upset about nobody liking his movies anymore? This movie dragged on and on and for what? For us to learn that the moviemaker DOES have people who like his movies still? That is so stupid. What the #### does that have to do with the robot he built and the boy happens to have? (coincidence). The trailer for the movie shows the robot flying through the air and a dragon shooting fire. It tricked me into thinking this may be somewhat of an exciting movie. With maybe some fantasy thrown in. (Not that a movie needs it to be good) But no. The robot is not flying. It is being dropped. Their is no dragon. It is a 1920 movie being made. I started this review trying to be structured but I am just spewing it out now. This movie is a waste of time and I do not understand how other people like it. This is the reason I created an account and wrote this first review. Some more ranting- How did the father die? It doesn't really matter but they didn't even bother with a real reason. Just fire shooting up the stairs after he heard noises. Lame. The movie tried to create tension filled and emotional scenes with way too much music but they just weren't there. Why when the kids tried to run away they all of a sudden were running AGAINST all the traffic. Run on the other side WITH the traffic dummies. And the boy was just living on stolen bread rolls? Please. The security guard side story was stupid and not needed. There was at least an 8 min scene with him trying to talk to the flower girl. What a waste of time.

When Alice in Wonderland came out, I was hoping and excited for The Lion King. More live action movies released and I know it was only a matter of time. This movie is fantastic. Not since Avatar have I been blown away by the visuals. Disney did such a good job on the animations, the animals move realistically, they look realistic and if animals could talk, this is how they would look while talking. A lot of people are hating on this movie to be part of the crowd, I give this 5 stars because the story wasn't changed, the CG is seriously mind blowing, the soundtrack was done in justice, it's darker than the animated original and it was pretty action filled. I feel this movie benefits from its live action. Scar looks more menacing, and you do get emotional and a heart warming sensation when watching because you see how an animal would actually look like when happy or sad.

My wife never saw the original - see really liked this movie as a stand-alone. A few differences: understandably, there wasn't the tower of animals at the end of ""I just can't wait to be king"". Also, the scene was omitted where the baboon hit grownup Simba on the head and when Simba complained, baboon said, ""it doesn't matter - that's in the past"" - I liked that teaching moment and wished they had kept it. Also, found Timon the meerkat having an overtly feminine man's voice distracting. Overall very well done and enjoyable!","AUG 11, 2019",7,Family
The Lion King,"The Lion King is a great movie, especially considering I have not seen the original (I know, I'm sorry). This review is coming specifically from someone who watched this as an entirely new movie, not a remake of the original. Based on that, I really liked it. The CGI is remarkable, pretty much fooling you into thinking its live action. The story and characters were great, I really felt for Simba and wanted to see him succeed in living up to his fathers name and dethroning his uncle as king. The music numbers were really cool and make you understand the characters better. The movie also had some great action and comedic moments throughout that made it very entertaining.","JUL 31, 2019",9,Family

The Lion King,"In the Pride Lands of Africa, a pride of lions rule over the animal kingdom from Pride Rock. King Mufasa's and Queen Sarabi's newborn son, Simba, is presented to the gathering animals by Rafiki the mandrill, the kingdom's shaman and advisor. Mufasa shows Simba the Pride Lands and explains to him the responsibilities of kingship and the ""circle of life"", which connects all living things. Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, covets the throne and plots to eliminate Mufasa and Simba, so he may become king. He tricks Simba and his best friend Nala (to whom it is expected Simba will marry) into exploring a forbidden elephants' graveyard, where they are attacked by hyenas led by the ruthless Shenzi. Mufasa is alerted about the incident by his majordomo, the hornbill Zazu, and rescues the cubs. Though upset with Simba, Mufasa forgives him and explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba. Meanwhile, Scar visits the hyenas and manages to convince them to help him overthrow Mufasa in exchange for hunting rights in the Pride Lands. Scar sets a trap for his brother and nephew, luring Simba into a gorge and having the hyenas drive a large herd of wildebeest into a stampede that will trample him. He informs Mufasa of Simba's peril, knowing that the king will rush to save his son. Mufasa saves Simba but ends up hanging perilously from the gorge's edge. Scar refuses to help Mufasa, instead sending him falling to his death. He then convinces Simba that the tragedy was Simba's own fault and advises him to leave the kingdom and never return. He orders the hyenas to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. Scar tells the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps forward as the new king, allowing Shenzi's clan to live in the Pride Lands. Simba collapses in a desert and is rescued by Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and warthog, who are fellow outcasts. Simba grows up in the oasis with his two new friends and other animals in their oasis, living a carefree life under the motto ""hakuna matata"" (""no worries"" in Swahili). Now a young adult, Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba reunite and fall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him that the Pride Lands have become a drought-stricken wasteland under Scar's reign. Feeling guilty over his father's death, Simba refuses and storms off. He then encounters Rafiki, who tells him that Mufasa's spirit lives on in Simba. Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him that he must take his rightful place as king. Realizing that he can no longer run from his past, Simba decides to return to the Pride Lands. Aided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar, who was about to fight Sarabi. Scar taunts Simba over his role in Mufasa's death and backs him to the edge of the rock, where he reveals to him that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged, Simba attempts to reveal the truth to the rest of the pride, while Scar, who previously claimed that he arrived too late at the gorge, attempts to deny it, but his knowledge of Mufasa's last moment exposes his role in Mufasa's death. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at a ledge near the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and attempts to blame his crimes on the hyenas; Simba spares his life but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever. Scar refuses and attacks his nephew, but Simba manages to throw him off the cliff after a brief fight. Scar survives the fall but is attacked and mauled to death by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray them. Afterward, Simba takes over the kingship and makes Nala his queen. With the Pride Lands restored to its usual state, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the assembled animals, continuing the circle of life.","MAY 24, 2020",9,Family

It's not just that the photo realistic CGI is soulless, dead and de-anthropomorphized, it's that it doesn't suit this story at all.

And taking this into account, the film does not fail at anything, faithfully following the facial expressions of the animals - as far as possible, of course - with a photorealism unimaginable until then. I'm not an avid fan of the original work, so I'm not very critical and, because of that, I understand the disapproval, but at least it didn't affect me at all, it just added to the experience!","OCT 12, 2019",6,Family

For me, this flaw became critical, leaving the overall film as a strangely vacuous experience. I knew something was amiss when the stampede sequence was neither scary nor sad, a scene which made such an impact on me in my childhood; Hans Zimmer's powerful score is not enough to counteract those furry, soulless faces.

The Lion King,"Despite the amazing special effects it is the inferior version of Lion King. To be fair I am not sure how I would rate it without the original movie. It could also be a case were I see it as inferior but the things I recognize from the animated movie damping a lower rating. The original was one of the best Disney movies. However they „borrowed“ heavily from Kimba the White Lion from Osamu Tezuka. If you ask how heavily lets say if it were in reverse Disney would have unleashed hell and sued them into oblivion. There is even a reference or side-blow by the Simpsons in one episode. To be fair I must also admit that they used some original themes. The movie is a recreation from the original and very accurate. It is the story of the lion Simba who is the son of the king of lions Mufasa. The kings take care of the pride lands but nothing is as easy as it seems. Mufasa has a brother named Scar who wants to be king instead. It is a coming of age or self discovery story transferred in the animal Kingdom with motives from a Shakespearean play. There is a lot more to the story that I cant spoil but will say the story was always entertaining and a lot of use put this in the favorite Disney movies list. It has a lot of great characters like Timon and Pumbaa who transcended the movie and became the stars of their own show. This is not surprising as they are funny, enjoyable and have a dynamic like only a few duos in Disney movie history. There is of cause Mufasa himself who is a role model for a good and wise king and his brother Scar who is one of the best antagonist in Disney movies. I must also say Simba and Nala are great together. If you like the original you find this very familiar. It is a recreation and quite fateful. What makes it worse is the realism. In the animation they took a lot of effort to transfer the emotions into facial expressions which with the voice actors gave really good results. Here the realism took this away so it is inferior. Also why make this movie when the original is already excellent is an often asked question. I see no benefits except the impressive special effects but like I said those took away a strength. The soundtrack is mixed. I enjoyed the original and they use a lot of great songs like “Hakuna Matata”, “Circle of Life”, “Can you feel the Love tonight” and “Lion sleeps tonight”. It has however not the same impact as back then despite never being bad. Overall this is a remake that was not necessary and can be skipped.

But baby Simba has a flagrant lack of expression while the adult counterparts have many. Why did they made the young Simba so facialy static ? I really did love the fights and chase scenes. This is about the best scenes in the movie because it actually exploit the 3d settings and amazing camera views. I really liked all the voices over. The Zimmer soundtrack still has long music pieces with no interruptions, moment of silence or soft music. That trend doesn't help the movie. I give it 62%.

The Lion King,"In the jungle, the mighty jungle, the lion... can't act because a lion has no facial expressions in real life. 2019's The Lion King is a visual masterpiece marred precisely by its ambition to be photorealistic. It's insane how each frame of this movie is computer-generated. I particularly loved the night sky timelapses that looked like they were pulled straight off a Nat Geo Wild archive. For a movie called ""The Lion King"", the lions were unfortunately the weakest part of the whole thing. Don't get me wrong, they're animated majestically, but because the creative directive was to make everything look ""realistic"", the lions barely have any facial expression. In real life, a lion's happy face is the same as its angry face. If the lions' faces can't do much of the acting, we now have to turn our attention on the voice talent. Donald Glover and Beyonce both have phenomenal voices—so iconic that I couldn't help but just see both music megastars in a cramped recording studio in California trying their best to deliver 25-year-old dialogue. I found Glover's voice too soft (read: cute) to sound like the grown lion portrayed in the film. And every time adult Nala was on screen, I just saw Beyonce, period. Bottom line: their voices are amazing, but their voice acting... let's just say the handicapped facial animation didn't do them any favors. The combination of both issues (lions' photorealistic faces + recognizable voices) kept pulling me out of the magic. So in the end, 2019's The Lion King is nothing more than a perfect Timon and Pumbaa feature.

The fact that everything was too well created meant that the characters' expressions didn't exist and this meant that in a film where the emotional charge is so great I didn't have any. To see, even with Mufasa's death I didn't get a little emotional. I think this hurt the film a lot and that's what didn't make me love it. In short, it is a reasonable film in which the transition to light action is very well done, but too much, which leaves us without the emotions that are so essential in this film.","AUG 3, 2019",6,Family

The Lion King,"Walking into the new Lion King, I was excited. One of my favorite childhood movies was being given the “live action” treatment, and the marketing for this film had been through the roof. However, when I left the theatre that one fateful night, I only felt disappointment, confusion, and, I have to say, rather depressed. The signs that this movie would end up being a disaster were all there: most of the trailers were shot-for-shot from the original, the Rotten Tomatoes score was, at the time, 52%, and the previous two Disney live-action remakes, Dumbo and Aladdin, were unpleasantly substandard to say the least. But this abysmal effort by the Mouse House may be the worst remake of them all, and that’s due to the main draw to this film: its visual effects. The Lion King is a 2019 American photorealistic computer-animated movie directed by Jon Favreau, and distributed and produced by Walt Disney Pictures. It is a remake of the 1994 2-D animated movie of the same name. Donald Glover stars as Simba, a prince lion who is exiled from the Pride Lands after his uncle, Scar (Chiwetel Ejiofor) kills his brother, the king (James Earl Jones), and convinces Simba that he was to fault. After reuniting with his childhood friend (Beyoncé), she persuades him to come back to the Pride and take his rightful place as king. The Lion King was announced soon after the critical and commercial success of Favreau’s The Jungle Book (2016), which used the same technology to recreate it’s CG animals, which were realistic looking and had clear facial expressions. It seems, however, that Disney thought it wasn’t realistic enough, because not a single animal in The Lion King expresses a shred of emotion. In the original, you can tell what each character is all about just by looking at the expressive animation, but every character in the remake shows the same expression the entire time. The CGI is also a detriment to the backdrops of the film. The iconic opening scene with vibrant, expressive colors and loud, african singing is replaced with a rather bland sunrise with heavily toned down colors and a much less loud and powerful rendition of the Academy Award nominated song, “The Circle of Life.” Speaking of songs… Every song in this movie is poorly executed, with the choreography being bland and repetitive, and the songs having less energy than the original. While in the original, the songs were presented with bright colors and a grand, cinematic spectacle, with animals jumping and dancing from location to location, the remake just has them walking around. Two songs in particular were especially butchered: “Be Prepared” and the Academy Award winning “Can You Feel the Love Tonight.” The former was shortened down to around thirty seconds and has Scar talking in a sing-song voice, while the latter is rushed and is set during mid-day. In fact, many things seemed rushed, as the pacing in this film is erratic. While the first act seems to drag on and on, the second act seems to speed by, adding pointless side-characters that don’t get expanded upon. This makes the third act less satisfying, as we, the audience, don’t see the main character go through as much hardship. Although this film is mostly devoid of quality, there are still many things that I did like. Other than Beyoncé, whose performance is distractingly fake-sounding, the voice-work in this movie is surprisingly great, notably Seth Rogan, Billy Eichner, and Chiwetel Ejiofor who play Pumba, Timon, and Scar respectively. The sound editing is also fairly impressive, as well as the lighting, and additional scoring by Hans Zimmer. However, none of these things can even begin to save this film. The only reasons to remake a piece of entertainment are either to make it into a different language, to add your own spin on the classic tale, or to improve upon the original. The Lion King does none of these things. It’s still in english, almost every plot-point is the exact same, and the flaws of the original are still present. Three more live action remakes are on the way: Maleficent 2, Lady and the Tramp, and Mulan. While my expectations are low, I still have a shimmer of hope that they’ll at least be better than this. 3.5/10","SEP 13, 2019",3,Family
The Lion King,"Words cannot express how vividly I HATE this movie. The fact it is my least favourite of all time is downright hilarity at its finest, as some of my favourites are **** this. This piece of **** junk. Get out of my sight, TLK 2019. No emotion and bad song renditions...","DEC 11, 2023",0,Family
The Lion King,"honstly I've been really shocked by this remake's CGI, but the imaging and visual effects are not everything, an emotionless movie with weak visual effects is a trash, but an emotionless movie with high and stunning visual effects(The Lion King 2019) is just a beautiful trash. You need to feel the emotions of the movie with your heart, not with your eyes. If you mute the sound of the movie you can't even understand when the characters are happy, scared, or sad. It likes that the dialouges are forced to be said by the characters. It's just like some realistic talking animals that have not any emotions in their faces, especially young Simba. In the end, a CGI documentary that wants to ruin your emotions from the original version of the movie.","OCT 13, 2019",1,Family

The realism doesn't go with the voice acting at all, it put me off, its like watching BBC documentary and then they start to talk? with mouths talking but the rest is realistic animal with no emotions?

The Lion King,"On a technical level this is impressive, the cgi is really out there and realistic which shows alot of invested effort on their part. But overall this is just an expensive failure in almost every way imaginable. Firstly it's star studded cast namely Beyoncé do horrifically at their voice work that beyond the awkwardness the cgi provides her acting adds another layer of lifelessness. She's near expressionless sounding like they are reading off a page. Now onto the next issue,the one I had previ commended for it's accuracy - the cgi. The choice to make the animals realistic was a really bad one that makes the film feel like an animal documentary in an alternate universe where they all speak. It removes you from the investing in what the story is attempting to say and Instead leaves you bored,which is my last point. This movie is boring. From it's pace ,writing and end you will be damned walking away with a positive experience.","JUL 4, 2022",0,Family

The Little Mermaid,"The Little Mermaid is an iconic master peice that has an amazing backstory, songs, characters, visuals, and hold a special place in most Disney fans hearts. Although the first Teaser trailer was somewhat successful. Many people were shocked to find that actress/ singer Halle Bailey was playing the iconic role of Ariel. Individuals were very happy to find a black woman playing such a huge role in the media. People were also not pleased as 'mermaids cannot be black'. Since when does a mythical creature that is half fish and half human has a race. When I first watched the live action in theaters i was in complete awe. Race was not importnat in this new story at all and focused on dreams, passions, love, and laughter. Ariel is still portraed the same, as Halle says 'Drive and gumption' are the perfect words to describe Ariel. Halle did an amazing job and infact had changed the scheme in my brian from the original ariel to the new one. thats how amazing she did. when i think of ariel, i think of the new one because of how much passion and drive she brought to the character. I rememebr when i first watched the little mermaid when i was younger. Part Of Your World was and still is an iconic masterpeice. Halle ate and left no crumbs. the new melody, passion, emotion, volume, and love she brought to the song filled my heart. AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING.","DEC 27, 2023",10,Family

The Little Mermaid,"One Of The Better Remakes While it’s obviously nowhere near as good as the original 1989 classic, The live action Little Mermaid is still a good film with Terrific performances (Especially from Bailey and McCarthy), Catchy and well written songs (Except Scuttle’s song which was absolutely terrible), And 80% of the visuals underwater are absolutely stunning.","JUN 15, 2023",8,Family
The Little Mermaid,"I wasn’t convinced with the cast when they first announced it, like I’m never convinced with any live action movie before watching it. After watching it my whole perspective changed, all of them were born for it. I totally loved Ariel and her sisters born on the seven seas. Ursula and Vanessa were fantastic! Eric was so handsome. The final result was great and way better than expected.","JUN 10, 2023",10,Family
The Little Mermaid,"One of, if not Disney's best, live-action remakes to date. Not only does the film beautifully pay homage to its predecessor, but it improves it. From jaw-dropping vocal performances to stunning cinematography, this movie packs it all.

The Little Mermaid,"I'm a 41 year old white dude who never watched the animated one growing up as a kid, but has as an adult since seen it a ton of times over the last 15 years as it's my wife's favorite Disney film and I have to say this is easily the best live action version yet by far!! I actually thought it was just a woke casting choice and was sad it wasn't a natural redhead cast at first, but after seeing it I can see that is not the case at all! She does amazing as Ariel. She nails the vibe and the voice and the songs and is very easily likable in the role. And everyone else in the cast does great in it! Melissa McCarthy as Ursula is fantastic and she gets lost in the role. They nailed the songs and I thought even the new rap song in the film worked and was funny because Ariel isn't having it as it happens. My biggest complaint is the cinematography could have been a bit better in some scenes but other than that I have no complaints. It really was a fun watch and if you can see it in 3d it's a nice additional touch. The overall story was actually improved upon and both Ariel and Eric are given more reasons to connect and be flushed out full characters. All in all Id rate it a 9.3 but since trolls on here are obviously unfairly rating this film I rounded up and gave it a 10. This movie is hands down better than all the other live action adaptations by far. Like it's the first one that has actually made sense as a live action and stood on its own I could almost go see it again the next day because it was such a fun easy watch. Don't listen to the haters, it's well made and well acted and well cast!

The Little Mermaid,"The live-action adaptation of “The Little Mermaid” was a delight and stands as one of the best in this ongoing set of live-action remakes that Disney has been treating us to. While the film is far from perfect, it makes a lot of fun and interesting changes to the source material. A few things of note are: Improving and expanding the character of Prince Eric, improving and expanding the dynamic between Triton and Ursula, improving and expanding the romance between Ariel and Eric, they removed Louis, the crazy chef guy. Yes, I consider this an improvement… Dude creeped me out as a kid, and they sort of “fixed” a plot hole with Ariel’s contract to Ursula. With all of the positives out of the way, there were a few negatives about this film. It suffers from the same issues that most of these Disney live action adaptation films suffer from… It just sort of felt like a formality or something for Disney to mark off of a check list. I mentioned that they made some fun adjustments to the original source material, but at the same time, there is a lot of elements of the film that follow the original “beat for beat,” and some of the actors’ performances suffer from this. Javier Bardem (King Triton) felt like he was struggling to find something new to do with his role but just couldn’t seem to make it happen because he was restricted by having to do an almost word-for-word performance of the original character.","JUN 3, 2023",7,Family
The Little Mermaid,"I was pleasantly surprised. I thought the entire production was done very well. It dragged a little at the end.

The Little Mermaid,"The movie is above average, but sadly has some down sides in comparison to the animated original, which was a solid 10/10. The story is told less consistent and logical. For example in the beginning for some sailors mermaids seem to be a mystery and superstition while over time this changes and it seems to be common knowledge that merfolk exists and there is just diplomatic silence. In other parts the movie is more faithful to the original fairytale than the animated version was though. This doesn't fix the plot holes and plot cracks sadly. The little mermaid actress is looking very fitting, but is not as good at acting, as she should be. Overall a lot of the cast could be better actors. It's not extremely bad, but its taking a toll on immersion. There is a exception though, which is Melissa McCarthy who plays Ursula. She is amazing in this role and in that role even easily surpasses the original Ursula from the animated version. She elevates the movie to heights the original Disney movie wasn't able to reach at parts. That together with the weaknesses brings the movie to a solid above average rating.","JUL 25, 2023",7,Family
The Little Mermaid,"The Little Mermaid Halle Bailey is the perfect Ariel. This remake of the beloved classic brings to life the fairy tale story of Ariel, and injects as much realness as the story can take. Halle Bailey is enough reason to love this remake. She's dainty; she sells the naive mermaid that longs to live on the surface world. Halle's voice is ethereal and when she comes to the surface world and can't use her voice anymore, her eyes properly portray her emotions and thoughts. Melissa McCarthy as Ursula is the movie's star, shining darkly and devilishly commanding every scene she features in. Jessica Alexander also adequately brings Ursula to the surface world as femme fatale Vanessa. Jonah Hauer-King as Eric is also a delight. The Little Mermaid packs a lot of new additions (other than the diversity it offers). The changes to the plot, especially the ones about the contract are well-done. Ariel not remembering the deal also lends to a better love story with Eric. Scuttle's new song sung by Awkwafina although loud and jarring is a welcome standout moment. For all the praise that The Little Mermaid garners, it also has its fair share of flaws. In the pursuit of realism, the movie's underwater scenes are too dark. The animations of Flounder, Sebastian and Scuttle are too realistic, creating a disconnection between the voice acting from the actors—that are well cast—and the animated characters. Due to the short screen time that Ariel's sisters get, they seem more like set pieces, and the diversity their casting offers ends up mostly performative. Most Disney remakes carry an air of 'why was this made again' but The Little Mermaid ranks as one of the best Disney remakes. 7/10","JUN 25, 2023",7,Family
The Little Mermaid,"This mesmerizing live-action musical, starring the talented Halle Bailey, is an absolute triumph! The Little Mermaid showcases the beloved tale in a fresh and captivating way, with stunning visuals that bring the underwater world to life. The CGI is seamless, creating a truly immersive experience that surpassed my expectations. In this adaptation of The Little Mermaid, we follow the enchanting journey of Ariel (Halle Bailey), a young mermaid who longs to explore the human world. The film stays true to the heart of the original story, emphasizing themes of self-discovery, love and the importance of staying true to oneself. The Little Mermaid delivers exceptional performances, breathtaking visuals, and captivating storytelling. Halle Bailey performs remarkably, capturing Ariel’s curiosity, spirit, and powerful voice. Casting a Black actress in the iconic role of Ariel is a decisive step toward diversifying the portrayal of princesses on screen. It offers young audiences, particularly Black girls who have rarely seen themselves in mainstream media, a chance to see a character they can deeply identify with, and I love that! The cast is rounded out with renowned actors who bring depth and charm to their respective roles. Tony winner Daveed Diggs gives a comedic, clever and heartfelt performance as Sebastian the Crab. Awkwafina’s delightful portrayal of Scuttle the Seagull and Jonah Hauer-King’s as Prince Eric brilliantly captures the original characters’ essence while bringing their unique charm and charisma to the roles. They skillfully breathe new life into these beloved characters, adding depth and memorable moments that both longtime fans and new audiences will appreciate. The costumes, designed by Colleen Atwood, beautifully capture the underwater kingdom and the human world above. The music score by the talented duo of Oscar winner Alan Menken and Tony winner Lin-Manuel Miranda is magical, seamlessly blending Menken’s enchanting melodies with Miranda’s vibrant and rhythmic compositions, resulting in an unforgettable and captivating musical experience. The Little Mermaid carries a powerful message of self-acceptance, courage and pursuing one's dreams. It promotes positive social behavior and portrays relationships built on understanding and empathy. I give The Little Mermaid 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 5 to 12, plus adults. It releases in theaters on May 26, 2023. Immerse yourself in the enchanting world of Ariel and embark on a magical adventure! By Hanadie K., KIDS FIRST!","JUN 7, 2023",10,Family
The Little Mermaid,"I absolutely loved seeing this film, especially in a theater setting! My mother (55) and grandmother (81), who both saw the animated film in theaters, also thoroughly enjoyed it. In my opinion, one of Disney’s best remakes yet. The film is true enough to the original animated film while still adding new scenes and songs that provide depth into the characters. The few changes that were made did not disrupt the plot in any major way, and did not bother me. The whole cast did a spectacular job, and Halle Bailey absolutely blew me away with her portrayal as Ariel. In addition to her ethereal singing voice, her face is so beautifully expressive and the viewer can truly connect with Ariel. Her performance brought me to tears multiple times, it was truly more emotional than the original animated film. I couldn’t think of anyone else who could have done such a fantastic job, she truly embodied the curious and kind Ariel. Bailey and Jonah Hauer-King (Prince Eric) had amazing chemistry, I was completely invested in their love story. Despite people mentioning dull and poorly done CGI, the underwater scenes were spectacular and colorful; truly magical. The animals, particularly Flounder and Sebastian, are drastically different looking than the animated film, but the realism works next to the live actors and they do not seem out of place. I found Under the Sea to be one of my favorite song sequences, mostly due to all of the dancing animals and plants. Bailey’s additional vocals were also a treat. The land scenes where also beautiful, and I loved the in-depth view of Eric’s castle and the village around it. Time was taken in the film to flesh out Eric as a individual, and the culture of his kingdom. After seeing Ariel experience 3 days on land, the viewer can truly see why she loves it and how she fits into it. I would absolutely recommend this film for anyone who enjoys the original film, fairytales, or love stories.","JUN 8, 2023",10,Family

The Little Mermaid,"IN A NUTSHELL: Disney has received a lot of terrible reviews of their previous live-action remakes in recent years; however, this one is actually their highest-rated one! Despite audiences mostly loving it, there has been a lot of criticism about various elements in the remake from Hans Christian Anderson purists to the drag community, finding fault with casting and makeup and everything else about it. Disney doesn’t seem to care, as they already have two more live-action remakes scheduled to hit the Big Screen in the near future. This version of the popular Disney musical was directed by Rob Marshall. Writing credits go to David Magee. Just like the original animation, the story is about a young mermaid who makes a deal with the sea witch to trade her beautiful voice for human legs so she can discover the world above water and impress a prince. With all of its controversy, what did YOU think of the movie? On a personal note, I watched the original animated movie with my children when they were very young. I have a melancholy attachment to it, so my expectations were extremely high. I still favor the original, but this one is still a nice addition to the Disney collection. THINGS I LIKED: This remake features the lovely Halle Bailey as Ariel. She has a beautiful voice and truly captures the look of wonder as she discovers the world of humans. When it was revealed that she got the leading part in the movie, the hashtag #NotMyAriel went viral. The controversy wasn’t necessarily because she’s African American but because a Black Ariel wasn’t true to the Danish origin of the story by Hans Christian Andersen. If you’ve seen the movie, do you agree or disagree with that sentiment? I LOVE that this film includes a cute cameo with Jodi Benson, who voices the original Ariel in the animation. In this movie, the actress/singer is seen as the person who gives the new Ariel a fork (“dinglehopper”). Jonah Hauer-King compliments Ariel as Prince Eric. I wish we could have gotten to know his personality a little better. The rest of the talented cast includes Melissa McCarthy, Javier Bardem, Awkwafina, Noma Dumezweni, Daveed Diggs, Jacob Tremblay, Art Malik, and more. Lizzo auditioned for the role of Ursula and even wore an octopus costume. I’m a fan of Melissa McCarthy and thought she did a fine job, even doing all of her own singing after being coached by Eric Vetro. It just made me wonder if Lizzo might have even been a stronger Ursula, certainly in the singing department. Bette Midler would have also been absolutely fantastic (I adore Ms. M), but Disney didn’t even reach out to her. This version honors the original animation while giving new legs to a new generation of little girls who don’t look like the typical Disney Princess of old. It’s so colorful, vibrant, and imaginative. I love all of the undersea creatures and how they interact with Ariel…except the sea snakes. Ick. The costume designer, Colleen Atwood, worked very hard to ensure all of the merpeople had accessories that were actually made from the sea. Disney swapped out the Old English Sheepdog for a Bearded Collie, just like it did in the 2006 movie The Shaggy Dog. We get four new songs in this version. The music was written by Alan Menken, just like in the original, but the lyrics were created by Lin-Manuel Miranda, the talented creator of the huge Broadway hit “Hamilton.” He also did the lyrics for Moana and several other musicals. Fun fact: It took 4 years to film the movie because production had to shut down during the Covid-19 pandemic. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: I admit that I’m completely biased in favor of the original The Little Mermaid because I have so many special memories of watching it with my children. That being said, this version isn’t as bad as some people are saying. It just doesn’t have quite the Disney magic and spark as the original…for me. One of the biggest complaints I’ve been hearing about this remake addresses the pacing. I tend to agree. There was no need to make this movie so long. I wish Sebastian’s little face could have been more expressive. If you struggle with vertigo as I do, you might get dizzy during a few scenes when the camera spins through seaweed and coral really fast under the sea. Now as a mother watching this story, it just made me laugh at how quickly and easily Ariel fell in love with someone she had never even met or talked to. Some of the mermaids look super CGI. I was sad that two songs from the original animation were removed: “Daughters of Triton” and “Les Poissons.” Sadly, also missing is the adorable Chef Louis. Since this is the age of feminism, Scuttle, the male seagull in the original animation is now a female. The song “Scuttlebutt” song was more annoying than charming. TIPS FOR PARENTS: People and creatures are in perilous situations. Dishonest conversations Jealousy is shown.","OCT 31, 2023",9,Family
The Little Mermaid,"Halle Bailey is so wonderful as Ariel. Jonah Hauer King is also very charming as the prince. Sebastian the crab is also very well realized and even though the design is a little bland, they fixed the facial expression issues from the Lion King remake. The underwater sequences look horrible sometimes but I think that is because we just saw Avatar The Way of Water and we have high expectations for underwater scenes now. The production above water like some of the action sequences are very high quality. The sequences with songs especially Under the Sea is a massive highlight; very vibrant and fun. The new songs are also very catchy. Alan Menken's score is also stunning, and there are key moments which gave me goosebumps especially towards the end. I think what works best is the chemistry between Bailey and King. The sequences in which they bond and fall in love is very romantic and I loved those scenes. This is my favorite live action remake from Disney and I am looking forward to seeing it again.","JUN 4, 2023",8,Family

The voices are not as good as in the original, especially the Sea Witch's and Sebastian's. So, all in all it was a decent movie with a great story but was completely unnecessary.

The Little Mermaid,"This isn't a bad movie. Halle Bailey does an amazing job singing and she genuinely feels like she is actually the character. However, going from the fun, vibrant animation of the original Disney film to this can be quite jarring and it can be difficult to connect with it the same way. I like some of the changes they made and others not as much. It is hard to go from Avatar 2 where the computer animation is amazing, to this where the water effects are inconsistent. Overall, it is a decent movie but it lacks the magic of the original animated film. I am sure kids will love it, though.","JUN 8, 2023",6,Family

The Little Mermaid,"Going into this fairly blind, I thought it was ok. The original was never something I can ever really remember watching. The lead did great under what was probably some goofy conditions to act through, incredible singing voice. The prince was a zero and really struggled through the movie.

The Little Mermaid,"Well i'll be the must objetive here. Its not the best movie out there but it isnt the worst neither. The cgi is the worst part, nothing looks real except the animals that talk (flounder, sebastian and Scuttle). Those 3 give too much cringe specially flounder and Scuttle. Also the rap between Scuttle and sebastian is the worst song in the movie, unbearable. The acting is passable, Bailey isnt as great as they want us to think but she does her job. Sometimes she has the same flat face (specially when she doesnt have voice). Ursula isnt as intimidating as the ursula from the original movie, she is supposed to be a sea witch monsters and McCarthy isnt intimidating. The New songs are passable also (except the rap) but giving Ariel another song while she doesnt have voice is ridiculous like they put it just to make Bailey sing another song. Unfortunately, this movie lacks the charm and magic of the original 1989 movie. Some scenes are way to dark and colorless. The fact that Éric is adopted is illogical and isnt explored more deeply, is just like they made it like that to justify making her mother black. Also the diversity in Triton's daughters are justified vaguely even if they explain that all the daughters have the same mother, illogical. In conclusion not the worst but not the best, is just another mediocre Disney live action that doesnt compare with the original movie.","MAY 26, 2023",4,Family
The Little Mermaid,"There are no surprises, no changes in the formula and, therefore, it's more of the same. This is the recipe that Disney has decided to apply in all the live-action remakes of its animated classics. True, there have been some worse than others, but The Little Mermaid is far from that, and yet it is the most controversial film of them all. I don't want to touch too much on that subject, but it's relevant to do so for the simple reason that there are millions of people who won't give a **** about anything else in the movie, they'll just notice that the lead actress has dark skin. It's disgusting, but it's part of a much bigger cancer than just a movie. One thing I can tell you is that, if you're a person with enough brains to see beyond that, The Little Mermaid is precisely the film it wanted to be. The music and its production values are on point and Halle Bailey, captures the spirit of the character by making it her own in her own personal way. It may not be the best that can be done in terms of adaptations, but it's not the disaster that many were predicting just because. This is a system product and therefore everything moves inside a box but there are levels of quality within that system and The Little Mermaid is not a failure in those terms. It's a regular, average and inconsequential movie, but for its intended audience, and by that I mean children, I think they'll enjoy it. And of course, you can argue again about the reason for their existence, as well as the rest of the remakes Disney has made in this line, but I think it should be pretty clear by now that they have no interest in stopping making them no matter how much some people complain. And no, the animated classics are not ruined. The damn movies are still there 100% available. If you don't like remakes there's always the option of not watching them, you know?","MAY 25, 2023",5,Family

The sidekicks are really plain characters. Melissa McCarthy tried to imitate a drag queen. The new songs are Encanto 2.0, the only adition or change to the plot I loved was the ""explanation"" of why Ariel fell in love or got interested in Eric. that was a really nice touch. And... Why Vanessa was white? the idea of ursula becoming Vanessa to trick Eric was to imitate Ariel, therefore she should have look like Ariel.","MAY 29, 2023",5,Family

The Little Mermaid,"The movie is not as bad as I imagined, it could be better without some laceration points (Wolk), the character's ethnicity and the smallest of problems, it had everything to be the best live action since Cinderella, but let's get to the point if this one If the film was not set in 1830, I would not complain about the exchange of ethnicities, but I have to take into account the time that has passed, there were no other ethnicities besides white at that time, according to how a triton had 7 daughters with different ethnicities with the same woman, only it could be cuckold , third making Ariel not know that she has to kiss the prince , fourth the changes in the songs some changed the meaning of the story to seem feminist and the last point because the prince didn't save Ariel at the end of the movie and Ariel saves him in the original movie and he reciprocates at the end of the movie, it changed the meaning of her father changing his opinion about humans because of him if it weren't for those points the movie would have 5 stars and would be the best live action version since Cinderella... not to say that this movie didn't improve anything, the prince was the best part of the movie and the music he got gave more depth to the character and has some tributes to the classic, it's certainly better many live action released from 2019 to here and too better than Peter Pan and Wendy!!!","MAY 26, 2023",5,Family

I honestly expected this to be worse, since even the critics aren't praising this. But in my opinion is just the same as other Disney live-action remakes (barring Cinderella).

The Little Mermaid,"I saw this film twice at the cinema. The first was with apprehension and some breathing exercises beforehand, and the second with a friend who couldn’t find anyone else to go with them. It was the second time round I could just watch the story unfold through the lens of simplicity, a bit of nostalgia, and managed expectations. The film isn’t nearly as dark or murky as shown in the early trailers, and there are some vibrant sequences, but it’s true we don’t see much of the kingdom that King Triton supposedly rules over. The underwater and mermaid CGI has a weird shiny/slimey vibe but passable overall. On land things are a little different to what we’ve seen before, including a truly awful ‘song’ from Scuttle. An obvious note that the realistic character design was a poor choice. Halle Bailey really does embody the elements of the original Ariel – spirited, adventurous, inquisitive – with a singing voice to match. Her performance, while at times showing lack of experience, feels heartfelt and honest, and her scenes with Eric are believable and charming. Melissa McCarthy kind of steals the show as a slightly unhinged Ursula, with a great song (albeit edited) and generally on point comedic timing. Prince Eric, although not really a price in this version, has a bit of character development that makes him more interesting in some ways, while stripping him of some significant attributes and moments. Overall though, he’s a character we want to win in one way or another. This remake does not hold a candle to the beloved 1989 original. However, while there are some significant changes from the original film, they are mostly inconsequential to the basic story if you resist the urge to roll your eyes or have expected anything less (or more, depending how you look at it).","JUN 10, 2023",6,Family

The animated version is far better (and managed to tell a tight story in 82 minutes; this version is bloated).

The Little Mermaid,"Remarkably dark and sinister in places, the underwater characters bob and sway with all the grace of a drowning victim, as if undergoing some macabre ritual to transform into a sea creature, but frozen halfway through the process. No performer stands a chance. Not due to lack of talent (although that's a problem too, primarily with the childlike void-simpleton prince) but instead there's too many problems to overcome, too many terrible decisions to rise above. It's as if the cast thought that their faces would be animated too in the end product, and therefor maintained a static expression as instructed. I also find it totally hilarious that we're given Javier Bardem in a fright wig and pearlescent merman armor, and yet it would be a total stretch to give the main animal characters just a little more expression or personality of any kind, as opposed to the thoughtless, absurd looking deathmask versions in the film. And then you get to the final scene of the film, which is more akin to a fan-fictioneer afterthought. Just in case people missed the main message of the film and needed a simplified version. These are the kinds of things that make me happy I haven't brought anyone into this world. If for no other reason than to spare them the indignity of these films.

Fantastic Four,"Josh Trank, Director of the Fantastic Four has had a hard time straight from the start. He did what I thought was an awesome job on Chronicle. Now the good things come to those who wait. Those who don’t listen to all the bad press, the colour of a certain hero and the actions of a director’s personal life. I will start by saying this. The movie has no place below its current Critical status under 50% On Metacritic. It has been brutalized by the fact that it stands on its own. It does not lend itself to the Marvel Cinematic Universe and as it stands right now, it will never get the chance. At least Sony have handed over most of a certain ‘web crawling menace’ into Marvels hands. But right now we have another rendition of a comic book franchise being re made for a new generation. In the same generation as the first two movies were made!! It really makes no sense why. If it is not joining the larger universe it must be bad right? Wrong. This is by no means, an amazing movie or even a great one. But it deserves to be seen and it deserves to do well. It is another Origin story. You may yawn at the fact we have seen them all before. But believe me when I tell you, there is no yawning when this movie starts to put its feet on the ground and move towards, what we all know will eventuate. A bunch of good guys, stop a bad guy and or corporation and happy endings all around. Is that so hard to enjoy? All the right cast are here and they all make what seems a bit far fetched, so smooth and likeable. The feeling that, if they are ok with it, then hell, so am I. Mister Fantastic (Miles Teller - Whiplash), Susan Storm (Kate Mara - The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo), The Human Torch (Michael B Jordan – Fruitvale Station & Chronicle), Ben Grimm/The Thing (Jamie Bell – King Kong & Tin Tin) & last but not least Victor Von Doom played by Toby Kebbell the wonderful actor that portrayed the Ape ‘Koba” in Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes. All of these eventually join forces, to become unlikely allies as the first ever Inter-dimensional Travel Consultants. Until they decide it’s ok to take the trip themselves. This is when things start to go terribly wrong, especially for old Victor Von Doom…being left behind and left to rot in a world we all know so little about and will probably never even see any answers to sadly. The powers and problems they bring back are then far too focused on the Government being the all-powerful evil corporation that it is. Without giving too much away, let’s just say, they are not set free when they return and are used for the sole purpose of certain organisations and another trip back… because the first time went so well! The music is composed by Philip Glass (The Hours) and sadly there wasn’t one thing I could take away from this composition apart from the awesome music they used on the Official Trailer. It brings nothing to the movie and that is not how it should be for a super hero flick. The entire film does feel like a boxed in world with nothing existing outside its walls till the very end when they need something to threaten. Two sets built solely around the creation of our heroes in a lab. Then onto an alternate dimension and then back to a lab again. This for me was the most disappointing concept for a film about super heroes growing into their own. It felt like they lost a budget and had to constrain it to the size of two football fields. Any bigger than that and the team gets tanked and they use another director. It feels boxed in yes, but at the same time it feels fresh. A time in cinema when it all goes back to its roots and is just a fun movie to watch. I enjoyed each and every one of these characters and enjoyed watching them grow into The Fantastic Four we know they can be. Sadly it is taken down a generic path. That actually abruptly ends all too quickly and no threat is ever really felt. Leaving our heroes not quite heroes until the sequel it hopefully deserves. The Special effects were above par. Everything from Jamie Bells The Thing ... to one amazingly horrific Corridor Sequence with a certain someone. The only thing i found distracting the whole movie (other than the lack of a decent soundtrack) was Miles Tellers facial hair. Just staring at it made me wonder, is this real? Is it glued on? As it stands however with all this bad wrap and not giving this basic, back to form, comic book movie a real shot, we may never see them again and quite frankly that is upsetting.","AUG 6, 2015",7,Family

Fantastic Four,"One of the best, perhaps even the best, superhero flick to come along. Probably what a lot of viewers didn't like is the fact the characters spend a considerable amount of time talking to each other rather than beating each other up for a half hour at a time. It's a classic origins story. It's not Casablanca and it's not Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf and it's not Guess Who's Coming To Dinner or In the Heat of the Night. It's a superhero flick. It has a beginning, a middle, and an end. The characters are likeable. And for once I found myself watching an entertaining movie instead of checking my watch every fifteen minutes like I do when trying to tolerate yet another typical action-adventure spectacular -- which have become yet another name for boredom.","JAN 5, 2017",8,Family

I have no existing attachment or affection for the comics or the characters as originally conceived therefore this was just another sci-fi film for me and I had a good time watching it.

Fantastic Four,This movie has a lot of flaws but buried beneath them is something really unique and fresh. It may not be for everyone with it's slow pace and few action scenes but this is sacrificed to allow more time for you to get to know the characters which are played by a great cast. The movie has a relatively short running time so the slow pace isn't as harmful as it could have been. Overall this is movie is a breath of fresh air and it shows getting super powers not as this amazing thing that everyone wishes for but as a horrible accident that makes you feel sorry for these characters.,"AUG 8, 2015",10,Family
Fantastic Four,"""Dull and downbeat"" and ""woefully misguided attempt"" are not the words to describe this film, at least to me. There are cons, though, because this and everything else that exists in the universe, is flawed. Doom is handled poorly and looks dumb, the film skips a year ahead when it's unnecessary, and the ending is no doubt rushed, nonsensical, and a colossal disappointment. To make up for these cons, though, I really enjoyed the performances and characters, which somewhat overshadowed the flaws with this film...except the ending. The ending was ABSOLUTELY ridiculous! Rushed and predictable. Doom was the worst aspect of the film, no doubt. Toby Kebbell did a swell job on his acting part, but the writers did not know what the heck they were doing with him. The fight between him and the Fantastic Four must've been at least five minutes tops! Usually, the final conflict between the protagonist(s) and antagonist(s) lasts longer than at least ten minutes, in previous experiences. The best part of the ending was seeing the terrible villain being killed because I could finally be relieved (partially) of the torture I experienced watching this bland and poorly handled villain for the previous thirty minutes or so. Though to try to forget about the ending, the first ten to fifteen minutes were great, with young Reed and young Ben beginning their friendship. The child actors were great, with a few minor slip-ups from Reed's child actor, but other than that small nitpick, those were easily one of the best segments of the entire film. The most memorable performances came from Miles Teller (Reed Richards), Kate Mara (Susan Storm), and Reg E. Cathey (Dr. Franklin Storm). Michael B. Jordan (Johnny Storm) and Jamie Bell (Ben Grimm) were fantastic as well, but the previous three stood out to me more. The last thing I'll say before I conclude is that I wished that, besides getting a much better ending, they would've expanded on the arc of Susan's adoption. That was really intriguing and I hope that in the sequel (if they still decide to make it) that they'll expand upon it more.","SEP 5, 2015",9,Family

Fantastic Four,"Can we just skip the origin stories in all of these reboots? I think we're all a bit tired of seeing the same dance, but with a different song. With that being said, Fantastic Four has 2 main problems. The first is that it is a reboot. The second problem is that there is just too much dialogue and not enough things blowing up (or maybe it seems like there's too much dialogue because we're so tired of origin plots). Anyways, other than those two flaws, the movie actually is not bad. It has a ""darker"" more X-Men like feel to it. The heroes were portrayed well be the actors. The CGI was actually very impressive. Human Torch, The Thing, and Dr. Doom looked amazing, it terms of CGI. Overall, I give Fantastic Four a 7. Why? Because Iron Man got a 7, and this movie is by no means any worse than Iron Man.","AUG 8, 2015",7,Family
Fantastic Four,"Let's get this out the way: A LOT of the negative comments on this films are from people with an agenda. Many have wanted this film to fail since day one and had zero intent on giving it a shot. I'm glad I did. While I admit there's some rushed/rough stuff towards the end I thoroughly enjoyed FANTASTIC FOUR. Yeah, I said it. I didn't go into this wanting/expecting a superhero movie. I went in wanting a sci-fi film and that's what I got. Sure, the last 25 minutes could have been better but that doesn't outshine the great start of the film for me. Plus, Doom's hallway scene is one of the most violent and dare I say bad-ass scenes in a comic book film. It is the best FANTASTIC FOUR film to date but if you're looking for tights and superheroics...this one won't be for you. But if you're into films like THE FLY, SCANNERS and CHRONICLE...I'd say give it a shot. It's a good start and here's to hoping the sequel moves forward.","AUG 6, 2015",8,Family

I'm part of the latter party so I enjoyed it. Look, it's not ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" but it wasn't bad either. In fact it was better than I expected. One of the best things is that the climax is really short. You heard me. A short climax. In a superhero movie. A dream come true. The facial expressions on The Thing were really good and Dr. Doom was a badass villain. Don't watch it if you worship the comics as your God. But if you like the superhero genre but not as an obsession, you'll like it. Not quite Fantastic but still good.","SEP 9, 2015",7,Family

The movie began nicely, maybe a little too stretched out in retrospect, but it didn't bother me while watching. Then when the action started, it all got too quick and too clumsy.

It's only a slightest better (keep reading why), but NOT worse than the utter attempt to show flash Jessica Alba's curves or Chris Evan's pectorals. This is rather your typical teenage + superpowers = outsider recipe. So they're a group of wonderkids working on some NASA project, one of them is a ****, so you know he's going to be the bad guy. At least you know where he's coming from and what interest he will have to fight the team. After some experiment goes haywire and they get their powers is a somewhat still appropriate way (at least we know why they did what they did and how each of them became what they became). Then some government routine ensues (both films compare here, pretty much), and we end up with the big fight. Notice that the way the ending is showcased, you don't get the impression that they're showing you a suave, a fashion model, a nerd and a wrestling champion getting together because shut up. Rather they're still willing to be the team they were, only their vocation now changes. So in all I'm surprised to see people say this one **** more than the one from 10 years ago. It seriously didn't. Were the 2005 garbage never produced, it would've probably ended up worse. But at least (the keyword here) they tried. At least.","DEC 18, 2015",5,Family

Fantastic Four,"Where to begin... The movie is, simply put, ab over produced superhero film that is the perfect example for everything that's wrong about superhero movies. Everything starts off strong, but less than 30 minutes in the movie starts falling apart. The story is so straight forward from here on out, that it's boring. You get a blunt and boring plot that assumes the audience is mentally challenged, because they explain everything down to the last atom or whatever. And for anyone who isn't a science nerd, that makes for one boring ass movie. Whoever did the trailer did a great job because they picked the best shots, and left out the other 88 minutes of crap. Mara gave the worst performance of the 4, acting as the ""pretty face"" for the film. For the bulk of the film she just stands there, not contributing anything to the plot. And then there's poor Jordan, who is equally useless. I have no problems about him being cast as her brother, but I have problems with him being cast period. He proves that he isn't ready for a blockbuster film, as his performance is Razzie worthy. Where Mara's Sue Storm is like a piece of scenery, he is an extra with too many lines. One of the things I enjoy about the comic is the family feel the group gives off. it's a comfortable feeling, and makes their dynamic that much stronger. The film does away with that for a ""serious"" sci-fi tone that ultimately doesn't pay off. There's absolutely no chemistry between the actors characters, which is a serious problem for this series. Teller proves that even great actors can only do so much with a really, really **** script. Richards just doesn't seem like the gallant, strong, leader the comics have built him up to be. Overall Teller does a good job with what he's given, but the character still comes off as awkward and just not superhero material. And then there's poor Bell. I don't know what they did to his voice, but it sounds like two rocks are having sex while someone rubs a cheese graters against a chalkboard. In short, it's unpleasant at best. The technical aspects of the film are fairly weak too. The fight scenes are passable, but they don't deliver anything new or different. It's pretty standard, hero vs villain, hero gets knocked down, hero has a ""clever"" comeback, and victory! Again, nothing new. Most superhero movies aren't very imaginative when it comes to climaxes, but F4 really takes the crap cake. The whole plot is wrapped up in less than ten minutes, and you're left thinking, ""Wait, that was the end?"" God I'd love to meet the person who read the final draft of the script and said, ""Ya this is great! Definitely worth over $100 million!"" The special effects are even more horrendous than those in the previous series. The Thing just looks like a big CGI rock, which is an improvement on the foam covered Thing from the 05 film. But some of the other effects are just inexcusable for a movie with such a big budget. In summary, don't waste your time watching this movie unless you like being disappointed. Caught somewhere between eh, and Batman & Robin disaster levels, this movie proves why FOX should just sell the rights to Marvel. They have yet to put out a decent comic based movie that isn't X-Men. And those movies really aren't that good anymore either.","SEP 26, 2015",4,Family

When the action did kick in however, it was good but even then it was only the ending fifteen or so minutes that the inevitable Dr. Doom fight went on. The beginning minutes were awesome, showcasing Reed Richards and Ben Grimm as kids is a really cool idea. Pros: Richards & Grimm as kids. Action is good (when finally commenced) Cons: Script is not the best. Generally slow. Special effects could be better. Overall: A '4' in my book.

Fantastic Four,"This review is paraphrased from the review I wrote on my blog. It’s not very often Marvel makes a movie that feels like a swing and a miss. (I know it is 20th Century Fox) This latest installment is not exactly a whiff. It’s more of a really deep fly to right just outside the foul pole… close but no cigar my friends. Movie studios tend to make these in threes so, they do have a few more pitches to look at. OK, enough baseball analogies. This film felt like they were going through the motions. Making another super hero movie, yada, yada, yada. The whole thing was a bit uninspired. The Executive Producer was Stan the Man himself, but yet the back story was pretty much ripped asunder from the comic’s origin. Johnny and Sue were not adopted siblings in any version of the Four. They kind of merged Ultimate Fantastic Four and the Original 1960s version. Many liberties with the story arc were taken and since Stan Lee served at the top of the production, I guess it’s supposed to be all good. One good rule of thumb for these types of movies is this: If you are going to chop up the story and piss off the fan-boys, you better make a great movie! JJ Abrams irritated the crap out of the “Trekkies”, but damn that 2009 movie was solid. So it kind of made up for the liberties taken with the story. This was no JJ’s Star Trek, however. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not screaming for movie ticket refund. This was a decent flick, it just fell well short of the expectation I have when Marvel is involved in a movie. In fairness, this was a 20th Century Fox movie since they own the rights. But again Stan Lee was Executive Producer. Marvel’s name and trademark opening animation still run at the start of the movie. You know, the guys that gave us Iron Man, The Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy. 20th Century also did two great Fantastic Four movies in the 2000’s and several X-Men movies with some solid success. Now a studio wielding a resume like that conjures up some heavy expectations. This movie is kind of the Marvel equivalent to Ryan Leaf in the NFL. Yeah, I said it. Ryan Leaf was a great quarterback, he just couldn’t elevate that amazing college game to the pro-level. This movie had all the stuff it needed to succeed, there just wasn’t proper execution. Wow, I am really on a sports analogy fetish today ;) Comic origins aside, this still could have been a much better film. The movie lacked the comic relief that has become such a big part of the success of the Marvel Universe films. The 2005 Fantastic Four movie had all that Marvel magic and frankly it just crushes this latest effort in every measurable way. That ’05 film remains firmly placed in the top 10 of my Super Hero Movie List. You might tire your middle finger working the mouse’s scroll wheel to find this film on the list. This one really didn’t have anything stand out. It was just kind of “meh”. This movie didn’t even have the obligatory Stan Lee Cameo. Sure at one point there was Johnny calling off-screen to an unseen guy named “Stan”. Really? Come on. Many may say that since 20th Century Fox owns the movie rights to Fantastic Four, they don’t need to follow Marvel’s tendency to have Stan appear in cameos. But hey Marvel makes huge money on these things, so a little emulation could bring some extra box office cash. Oh and in case you forgot, one of Stan’s biggest cameos came in the 2005 Fantastic Four as the chatty mailman. There were some “Easter eggs” and it pays homage to the comic stories in several scenes. Even the very last scene was practically taken right off the last page of the first Fantastic Four Comic in 1962. Another notable miss is the also obligatory after credits bonus scene. Yes, that’s right, I rode the credits to bitter end and no such scene appeared. I do know that a guy named Edward Poveta was the Payroll Accountant for the production, and that’s good to know ;) On a positive note: Reg E. Cathey plays Dr. Franklin Storm. The fan-boy base was a bit tweaked as he is part of the whole Johnny and Sue aren’t related issue. This guy however, is the bright light on the stage. He is the only actor I felt a connection to in this production. He doesn’t carry the whole film per se, he just brings a some much-needed gravitas to an otherwise bland cast. This movie’s biggest failing is probably the dialog. It may be the worst in Marvel silver-screen history. This movie won’t put you to sleep and won’t smell like a fart in an elevator, but if you are a Marvel fan you will not leave the theater with that Marvel movie buzz you may be accustomed to. Now that Marvel is cranking out blockbusters and hauling in tanker-loads of box office cash, perhaps they need to buy the rights back to Spiderman, X-Men and Fantastic Four from Sony-Columbia and 20th Century Fox.","SEP 5, 2015",5,Family
Fantastic Four,"Pros: -The actor’s are all doing a pretty good job. -The score is kinda decent. Cons: -The action is not very good. The Fantastic Four use their abilities in the most generic ways possible and some of the attacks just feel weak. -The lighting is terrible. The film is too dark and gloomy most of the time, which is such an odd choice for a superhero team as colorful as the Fantastic Four. -The first half of the movie feels nothing like a Fantastic Four film should feel, but it’s still more enjoyable than the second half. -Why are government scientists searching for someone who could potentially help them with their inter dimensional teleporter at a HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE FAIR!? -The entire second half of the movie happens because Reed, Johnny, and Doom make a stupid decision while drunk. -Why the hell would Reed risk putting his best friend Ben in danger by having him go with them to Planet Zero? I know he’s drunk and not thinking straight, but come on, this just feels like such a forced way to get Ben back into the plot. -The scene where Reed, Johnny, Sue, and Ben get their powers feels super forced. -I have no idea how Sue even managed to get powers at all since she didn’t even go with them to Planet Zero. -The film intentionally skips over what could have been the most interesting part of the story: the Fantastic Four getting used to their powers. -The final conflict is too short and the Fantastic Four manage to beat Doom too easily. -Doom’s powers are too vague. -Doom himself in this film is honestly a disgrace from the version in the comics and cartoons. There’s taking liberties with a character, and then there’s just throwing away what made him a great villain in the first place. -The rivalry between Ben and Johnny is very forced. Final Verdict: Fant4stic is dull, soulless, messy attempt to launch a Fantastic Four film franchise. The first half is kinda decent if you completely ignore the fact that this is supposed to be a Fantastic Four movie, but the second half is just bad. The one thing I will give this movie however is that it has reaffirmed to me that no matter what Marvel Studios does with the Fantastic Four, there’s nowhere to go but up from here.","NOV 2, 2019",4,Family

Trank, Slater & Kinberg have created a very modern story here that brings four victims of circumstance together with a common goal, even while at odds with one another. The acting & visuals are top-notch. My only concern with the story is the mishandling of Doctor Doom. It's almost as if they used the 2005 film as the basis for Victor instead of diving into the source material. Even with that, though, there is much much worse out there (see BvS). Side Note: I was really hoping that the naming conversation at the end would turn into the Norm Maconald bit.","MAY 10, 2016",6,Family

Fantastic Four,"A film plagued by drama and tension between director Josh Trank and Fox studios, Fantastic Four presented audiences with little potential. Going into the film with little hope, it initially surprised me with an almost promising start and a somewhat entertaining first half. The film however suffers by turning itself into one big build up, a build up to an overly cheesy and disengaging final act. Countless use of cheesy and poor dialogue, terrible CGI, and a story that made little sense, help to ensure that a good Fantastic Four film remains to be created.","AUG 10, 2015",4,Family
Fantastic Four,"I like this movie more than most here but I totally understand why it got so many bad reviews. The movie can be divided into two parts: a lousy 1st half and a decent 2nd half. The movie takes too long in establishing the main characters. It could've done away with the whole ""friends from childhood"" bit; it just should've started with them in their early 20's graduating from college or something like that. On the plus side, I really like how the villain, Dr Doom, is created but unfortunately he doesn't have much screen time. If the movie had spent more time on the Fantastic Four v Dr Doom and less time on the setup, we could've had a good if not ""fantastic"" movie.","AUG 10, 2015",5,Family
Fantastic Four,"Exposition, exposition, exposition and exposition that never really goes anywhere, and then the movie has an action scene that lasts for about 10 minutes. As a superhero movie, pretty bad, but if there's gonna be a sequel, there is potential if the sequel has the right direction. But this is supposed to be a big entertaining superhero movie, and the whole movie is just a confirmation for a sequel. Not cool man.","DEC 23, 2016",4,Family

Fantastic Four,"So the one-massively criticized superhero flick is here, and it’s been called one of the worst movies ever made, a crappy Batman & Robin, and even ""Craptastic Bore"", but is it really that bad? The not so Fantastic Four is defently an origin story that takes well too long to tell, and that forgets important plot details and that’s well too short to be a superhero-flick and that never really pays off. The first act is definitely the greater aspect, with its interesting plot and somewhat exciting events. But there are also some inlogical things, especially when it comes to the editing. That lack of greatness really escalated later in the second and third act. The characters are always the major detail of every movie that needs to be well written and presented, but I'm wondering if the writers were drunk or just stupid while they were writing it, because it's just so badly done. It took the half part of the movie just to get the characters going, so it took well too long to introduce them. The second thing is that we never got to see how our heroes developed and got control over their powers. The major reason is that the editing is so terrible. They skipped everything from how they got to learn to control their powers to how their friendships and chemistry developed! They therefor missed important plot and character details. That's a serious mistake for one that just were a part of the development of the X-Men franchise, well good luck on getting back there! That's just one small aspect with all the big mistakes in this reboot, and another one is definitely the many and serious plot-holes throughout the whole movie. The storytelling is also very messy and just weird from time to time. But the real mistake is the lack **** third act. We didn't get to see the wrath of the villain until like 20 minutes before the movie ended...what the hell?! Another thing is that Dr Doom is extremely vaguely presented and there are very little relatable aspects with him. He's ugly too, and you can't really feel that understanding of him, why he's the villan. The only great thing about him is that he's defently scary. So yeah, it's not a flawless movie, not by a long shot. But it doesn't end there; The crappy Fantastic Four also got some predictable moments, and dialogs here and there, and the movie is extremely short. The major BAD thing is that there are so much plot and character story missing, but why is the movie so short then? There are even shots in the trailers that looked promising, and some of them wasn't in the movie! Im stunned by how this movie even became to be this bad. Even the climax is just too short and well too rushed for its own good. Sure it got some cool moments, but ohh myy it tries to be serious, but it totally fails due to terrible editing and storytelling; not to mention some of the vague CGI and forced humor. It's understandable why many out there hates it; it’s full of enormous flaws. One of the most flaw-filled movie I’ve ever seen with its lack of plot and character details, character development, massive amount of plot-holes, messy editing, vague and non-relatable villain and of course the forced humor, rushed third act and the dry chemistry between the characters after they got their not so fantastic powers. But it got some bright aspects too; like great actors, good soundtrack and somewhat okay dialogs, but that's sometimes forced to the audience (fact-based dialogs). Sure it got some okay aspects and you can still watch it, but the flaws are just so big and impossible to hide from. It's indeed a bad movie with it's terrible editing and lack of a Marvel-entertainment that steals the show nowadays. Give the rights back to Marvel or try again Fox! The reboot that failed. 5.5/10","AUG 13, 2015",5,Family

For me, Fox didn't want to lose the rights and given that the next X-Men is scheduled for 2016, they would have had less than a year left for post-production, which was too short.

Fantastic Four,"Fant4stic (2015), directed by Josh Trank, is one of the superhero movie remakes which are always concerned to have better special effects than the previous versions of them but this movie turned out to be much different than other remakes. It’s so BAD! Almost everything in here ****! The acting was also one of the problems that turned Fant4stic into a…Fantastic Four parody starring Miles Teller as Reed Richards, Kate Mara as Sue Storm, Jamie Bell as Ben Grimm, Michael B. Jordan as Human Torch? I mean that character in this movie was nothing like in the comics. Blonde hair, white skin but in here black hair and black skin. You got the wrong cast! Also Victor Von Doom looked like a piece of turd. He was more like a parody character and spoke like a character in a parody. Everything he did was funny. His hood and cape made him a bigger turd. He looked completely worse than Dr. Doom in Fant4stic (2005). The plot was a complete **** People didn’t want to spoil plots to others but the thing is this movie doesn’t have anything to spoil! The Fant4stic got their powers, Dr. Doom came and created his new universe and they had to stop them which they succeeded. This plot was almost the worst of the worsts. The screenplay was mostly terrible. They talked like children and teens but they’re adults and the screenplay made them act like their childhood. There were more significant stuffs from the comics that they didn’t take: humor, joy,… I barely laughed at this movie, like there’s nothing funny at all. I only laughed at the terrible CGI they had done. The visual effects was thought to be the best of the movie but then it was opposite. It was also one of the worsts about this movie. The background’s okay but the CGI was quite cheesy. I mean look what they had done to Reed’s arm when he stretched it. It looked so bad (as bad as a movie from the 90s trying to use CGI that wasn’t invented yet like The Mummy Returns (the Scorpion King looked like something we wanted to laugh at, not to fear)). Even though thi movie was owned by FOX, nothing could be done greatly. I really wanted to like the movie, but there was nothing to like, nothing to be impressed. We are talking about superheroes, not science projects and this movie, it took most of the minutes about science projects here and science projects there. There’s too much. The superheroes time was so short like only half an hour when Doom came back and the Fant4stic tried to stop him. It was a terrible idea to add too much of science in this movie but anyway, it was already bad. This is one Marvel movie nobody wanted to see.","MAY 3, 2019",2,Family

Apparently they had problems between director and producer, and it shows ad nauseam, too many things off set. · Good things: the start, honestly, is quite promising, it makes them have chemistry between the characters and it is quite cool, a shame that they then ruin everything. · Bad things: Doom is literally terrible, the mother who gave birth to me, the script is horrible, the dialogues are more of the same, the ending, or in general the second half of the film is quite bad, it has a terrible approach and the resolution It's too fast. · Conclusion: it can be digested, but it is quite lazy, if you want to see something from the Fantastic Four, watch the previous ones, which at least are more decent.","MAR 9, 2022",3,Family

Hereditary,"Hereditary is without a doubt one of the most frightening, deeply disturbing, and evocative pieces of horror I have ever seen. Instead of scaring you right away, the film slowly takes its time to build a bone chilling atmosphere and genuinely get under your skin. Hereditary uses its isolating cinematography, tense dialogue, and bloodcurdling soundtrack to quietly whisper to you that something unspeakably horrifying is bound to befall its cast of characters. The characters themselves are all impeccably acted and written to feel like real people. Each of the characters have their own multi-layered fears and traumas that they attempt to deal with throughout the story. The film explores how a family can slowly be driven apart through grief and tragedy as well as the horrific consequences this can have on the lives of each of the family members. Overall Hereditary is not for everyone and isn't an easy movie to watch. It is very clammy, unnerving, and disturbing. But if you are looking for a mature horror story that grounds its terror in human emotion and is genuinely frightening, this is the movie for you.","NOV 8, 2023",10,Horror

My biggest issues with the movie was the direction of the story (It all works together but is kind of dumb) and the main guy looked a little too old for the part.

Not only to they appear at the funeral, which the mom notes the unfamiliar faces, their sigil is carved on the post Charlie is decapitated on; suggesting they placed the deer and orchestrated the nut consumption. In kind, upon repeat viewings I definitely try to pick out more of these signs. Toni Collette's performance in this film is also something that floored me.

Hereditary,"We are facing an extremely thrilling feature right here. 'Hereditary' directly inserts itself in the continuity of the alternative modern horror movies, cultivating throughout its story a visceral, unwholesome and toxic atmosphere. The cast is just awesome and delivers a stunning performance including from Charlie (Milly Shapiro), who clearly is here thanks to the cleidocranial dysostosis she suffers from. I guess all means are good to evoke fear and a sense of strangeness in the minds of the audience. Each actor and actress is on the perfect place for him/her excepted maybe for Joan (Ann Dowd). The photography, overall artistic direction, lighting, scenes are just top notch. The pace leaves much to be desired but participates in the terrific intensity of the movie. The story is to me the worst of it all. 'Hereditary' presents us numerous tiny and gigantic clues. As you watch it for the first time you do know they will be usesuf in a near future. But no. At the end of it, there is as many events, characters' choices and scenes remaining unexplained. The details struggle greatly to come together to form an understandable and engaging whole. I checked explanatory videos but I truly didn't learn more than what I already knew, as the storylines of the movie seem to be dark for many of us. The end is characterized by a rarely-seen before intensity but is clearly related to paranormal and surreal which ruins a major part of the realistic atmosphere.

Good production, solid actors, but really a total nonsense. Is not scary at all, it's too long, too slow.

Hereditary,"The film, which has no resemblance to The Conjuring, is the product of a highly successful marketing campaign. Offering nothing new, the film marks the beginning of a brand-new trend. It attempts to scare and thrill the audience with its disturbing energy and tension-inducing music of ""something is coming"" on empty visuals. While I appreciate its last 20 minutes, unfortunately, the final scene ruins the atmosphere of the entire film. It is highly likely that the audience, accustomed to Hollywood horrors, may appreciate the movie for its openness to novelty. It is not a familiar style. Apart from the characters' dark sides and the concept of the world behind the occasionally attempted eerie curtain, the film falls far below my expectations. It may be a good film in a year like 2018, which experienced a shortage of horror films. However, overall, although it may be remembered as the beginning of a certain style, at least for me, it is a relatively weak film in terms of the horror genre.","OCT 29, 2023",5,Horror

Hereditary,"I'm guessing I detested this movie for most of the reasons deranged people out there have been giving it thumbs up. I like to think I have pretty solid taste in horror flicks: Alien, The Thing, Evil Dead 2, Nosferatu, It Follows - give me solid characters, solid lines, solid thrills and intrigue and direction and leave me saying ""Holy **** that was some well-executed fun."" So when people were cumming themselves left and right about this movie, I naturally had to see what was up. Here's the deal: If you're looking for an equally fun and innovative (because, hey- it's gotten GREAT reviews) thrill ride of a horror flick along the lines of the classics and/or new classics, THIS IS NOT IT. If, instead, you're looking for a severely f-ed up, enjoyment-depleting, WTF-inducing nightmare, knock yourself out. Just promise me you won't have kids. I had high hopes, and there were some good moments with some solid promise. And then the first WTF thing happened and everything was simply terrible and depressing. I give it a 5 because the acting and atmosphere (two things that certainly matter) were spot on, but -10 for the story and characters and for sending me home feeling disgusted with a terrible taste in my mouth.","AUG 12, 2018",5,Horror
Hereditary,"For my second review at The Puritan Post, I really wasn’t sure what to write about. However, the other evening, when walking down the street with my wife Prudence after a lovely dinner at Arby’s, we ran into Ace, my local VHS bootlegger and dealer (everyone has one). “Seen the one with Toni Collette and her crazy family?” Ace asked me. “I don’t think so,” I replied, thinking in my head that Ace must have been referring to the Toni Collette movie I’ve been hearing about the last couple years, “Little Miss Sunshine”, that I’d still yet to see. Prudence and I purchased the movie from Ace and went home. We settled down with our Snow Caps and popped in the VHS. This is my minute-by-minute analysis of the movie I thought to be “Little Miss Sunshine”: [WARNING: Spoilers for the movie HEREDITARY (2018) follow] 10 min: So far pretty much what I expected. Dysfunctional family with a moody son, introverted little girl and Toni Colette as the mom. However, I thought Greg Kinnear from my beloved “You’ve Got Mail” was the dad, but instead it’s the main dude from “The Usual Suspects”, Gabriel Byrne. 13 min: The little girl just snapped a bird’s neck off. Not sure what this has to do with beauty pageants. The movie is a lot darker than I expected. Still no sign of Allen Arkin. Heard he won an Oscar for this flick. 34 min: There is finally a car, but instead of a road trip, only the brother and sister drive. To a teen party with drinking and pot. The sister starts going into anaphylactic shock because she accidentally eats nuts, and on the way to the hospital sticks her head out the window and gets decapitated. I don’t think this movie is “Little Miss Sunshine” at all. Well, I looked it up. This movie is definitely not “Little Miss Sunshine”. It is a film from 2018 called “Hereditary”. I finished “Hereditary”, and let me tell you, that is one messed up movie. I eventually found a copy of “Little Miss Sunshine”, and watched that movie as well. What a delightful film that was. I actually intend to write a full movie review about “Little Miss Sunshine” in the future. As far as Hereditary goes, while not really my cup of tea, I do see the inherent cinematic merit of the flick. It is a horror movie that serves up plenty of disturbing imagery but also backs it up with character development. I had a few issues with plot contrivances like the fact that this brother would bring his kid sister to a party in the first place and that the mom would make him do so. Also, any kid with that severe of a nut allergy shouldn’t leave the house without an epipen. Sufficed to say I got a bone to pick with Ace the next time I see him.","NOV 27, 2018",5,Horror

But, I can not for the life of me give it a 7 because first and foremost it should entertain but it didn't. It is suspenseful but is it scary enough? No. You can afford to wait for it on HBO if you really want to watch it.","JUL 2, 2018",6,Horror
Hereditary,"I went into this one with high expectations, buying into the hype and comparisons to ""The Exorcist"". I really wanted to like it. The trailers made it look so much better than it actually was. I've seen this before - showing the best moments of a movie in the trailer. I bought into it this time. It's a shame because I really like scary movies, even if they really don't scare me that much. Movies like 'Sinister', which I left feeling a little unsettled are what I look for in a horror film. It was too long - they could have cut at least 15 minutes off the running time and it would have been a more interesting movie. It took too long to get to the point - I found myself nodding off at times. The acting was **** for the most part - surprising considering there were some recognizable actors involved. At the screening I went to it elicited laughter at certain points when, I'm quite sure the scene (a seance) was meant to bring forth surprise and fear. There was really only one moment where this film took me by surprise. It involved a car traveling at high speed, a person's head out the window and a wooden telephone pole. There was some interesting violence - not that I go to these movies for the violence - a little creepyness is what I'm looking for. By the time they got to it I had pretty much tuned out. Too long, not scary or creepy, sub-par acting and writing, and comedy when there shouldn't have been, adds up to...... a 'just wait for it to come out on video' offering, or better yet, skip it, and watch ""The Exorcist"" again. You'll be much more entertained.","JUL 20, 2018",6,Horror
Hereditary,"The tragedy that the family faces is absolutely bone-crushing, and they could have built a good drama around that. But I never bought this as a horror movie, even though it's certainly marketed as one. I love movies and I'm even open to the occasional so-called ""art movie.""

It is true that it is a film that presents a state of tension that you can experience as a viewer, and this was good in the first half, but the ending was very disappointing. The only feature of the film is the extreme calm that creates a state always fraught with anxiety, in addition to the character of the little girl, Milly Shapiro, during the first half hour. It was indeed a way to increase adrenaline in the blood, and the distinguished performance of Alex Wolff, but I think that the ending of the film in this way contained a defect, and this is what made me a little cautious about it.

Hereditary,"I think the movie loses its essence in the third act, by trying to overexplain the plot and mythology and by focusing more on narrative than on the utter agonizing atmosphere it was building. The frustration caused by that ending is just amplified by the fact that everything was being done so amazingly well.","JUN 23, 2018",6,Horror
Hereditary,"I think its a well crafted film and certainly the first half of the film was on par with some of the best drama/horror films - such as the J Horror variety and early 80s. However, as notedd by many people, this film is rather cliche by the end and if you've seen Rosemary's Baby, you've bascially seen this film and its logical conclusion. At worst, Ari Aster is just borrowing from a variety of great horror films and trying to mash it into a messy plot that just doesn't add up. Aside from some superb acting with the cast, and an eerily soundtrack which is akin to some of the haunting sounds by Johnny Greenwood, the film is borderline meandering and the characters never built up enough relationship for the audience to actually care about their peril. In fact, the majority of characters spend so much time outside their house and in daylight that you almost forget this is a horror film. It's a shame because I loved the Witch, the Babadook and It follows (and also It comes at night), but this was the one where I felt the film didn't serve its story and theme. Overall if you are looking for an eery atmospheric film (without much jump scares) and a relative semblance of a plot, Hereditary is decent enough for a watch - however, I doubt it will stick in your mind for long.","JUN 30, 2018",6,Horror

Hereditary,"I read a lot of the favorable reviews for Hereditary, so I went into watching it with quite a few expectations. However, I sadly have to say that it failed miserably at being what it promised to be: a great horror movie. The movie begins slow, and really only picks up pace in the last 20 minutes or so (which is not necessarily a bad thing). However, the movie puts into place so many pieces that ultimately don't come into play, or are at least redundant, that I got the impression that the movie aspires to be more than it actually is, and thus fails in the grand scheme of things that make a horror movie scary. I've read reviews for this movie that said that they couldn't sleep for weeks after watching it, that the movie gave them a lingering feel of dread etc., you know the drill. Reading this stuff really makes me wonder whether I'm too jaded after watching one too many horror movies, since there was no sense of dread, at all, and there was only one scary scene, and that's already being generous. So, to conclude, it's not like Hereditary is the worst movie I've ever seen, far from it, it's well acted, has a nice sound design, great production value, but it's just not a horror flick. I don't even know what it's really supposed to be, maybe a drama with supernatural influence, but it certainly isn't scary, and it's a shame, since the background and world sound quite interesting, but ultimately fail to deliver.","NOV 18, 2018",4,Horror

Hereditary,"Yeah, the movie loses a lot of points because it essentially boils down to a movie about a deranged, frigid matriarch torturing her vulnerable family through her lunatic proxies after her death. Through manipulation of the vulnerable. Not only that, this group of lunatics murders everyone in the family for their own desire for gold. It tries to spin it as a movie about demons and whatever its called when a demon takes over a body, but that's not what the movie is. Again, it's a movie about lunatics banding together to destroy an innocent group of people, and that makes this movie much worse. Here are alternatives that would have made the movie much better: Annie is insane. That is what she inherited from her mother, she was imagining Joan, trying to kill peter with paint thinner and fire, accidentally murders her husband with lighter fluid in her deranged state of mind, kills herself and leaves her son traumatized. While this may seem more cliche or over-played, it fits much more with the vision of the film. The hints of Annie's insanity were laid out through out, from her bizarrely vicious face of anger at times, to how strange her eulogy to her mother was, to how she lied about going to the movies to go to grief session groups (seriously?), to how people in her and her mother's life were died in terrible ways Circumvents the ridiculous cult narrative that was jammed in at the end in a movie that isn't a cult movie. Another alternative is to take this down a Donnie Darko route. The movie had the elements of it, they likely used it heavily for inspiration. But if they use that, then they can incorporate the spirits and demons interfering with the lives of the family or whatever for some end, likely the end of eternal damnation that could be passed down from generation to generation. In any event, if the movie had gone a different way, this 5 would be a 8 or 9.","APR 1, 2023",5,Horror

It is said that the satanic cult planned everything out to get a man as their leader rather than the awkward and annoying girl. However it seems entirely too far fetched that this cult planned on mother allowing her to go to this party... and to have a nut infested cake... and to have this girl eat a cake without asking what’s in it or having the slightest thought process of “should i really eat something from a room of random strangers?” Then you’re going to tell me it was planned for them to rush to the hospital and have this girl stick her head out the window only to be decapitated (which was funny as hell by the way).

You saved me once again.","SEP 30, 2019",0,Horror

Hereditary,"For all the hype this movie received pre-release, it failed to deliver upon so completely that I left the theater almost angry at the fact that I had been so incredibly duped. Hereditary is a slow, plodding, and ultimately boring affair that I couldn't wait to leave behind me. My biggest issue with Hereditary is that it breaks absolutely zero new ground. This movie has been made any number of ways; add to that it hones in only on those who have a fear of spiritual/religious matters. While there are many religious folks left out there to scare with ominous music and a few ""shock"" scenes, the rest of the horror community is totally left out of the gag. Another matter is character development. While aptly acted, I simply didn't care what happened to a single one of these people. They were 2 dimensional as if specifically designed to be horror movie characters. Gabriel Byrne could have been cut from the movie and I'm pretty certain no one would've noticed. Let's hope this is not a trendsetter for the latest wave of horror or we're in for a predictable, dull ride.","AUG 30, 2018",3,Horror
Hereditary,"I have no idea what the hype was about. The first 15 minutes were intruging enough but then it becomes slow & boring with a sudden jump scare everyone saw coming (any horror buff worth his/her salt, knows what's coming when a character sticks their head out of a moving car window). Then again it slows down to a snails pace with the most bizarre rushed laughable cliched ending I haven't seen since the 60's. I expected a lot more especially with the calibre of the actors in the movie and seriously we could've done without the granny/grandad nudity, won't be able to unsee that! The movie reminded me of the highly rated Rosmary's Baby plot, but that's where the similarities end. Very, Very, Very disappointing.","SEP 12, 2018",1,Horror
Midsommar,"Indeed a creative and very detailed film. It doesn't have a generic script, as the main focus is precisely the historical context and not a small group of teenagers in a risky situation, as is usually seen. So it's something very trivial. Each emotion presented by the characters reflects on attitudes that arise during each one's trajectory, it is nothing 'played'. One point about the effects was the out-of-focus camera, which creates a doubtful feeling as to whether all this is really happening, causing agony and anticipation about what will happen. The soundtrack also helps to make everything more agonizing, using whispers and voices. The most interesting thing is that practically the entire film takes place during the day and yet it doesn't lose the essence of a good horror/suspense film. Regarding the film's messages, the community's cultural difference causes shock and fear among the group of friends, especially due to the extremely violent sections. Through the unknown is precisely when we end up discovering our own strangeness. Not to mention that the community has a very extreme collective sense, where it is clear that in many situations, they feel each other's emotions, while the group of friends represents individualism, ending up interfering in each person's journey. It is not a film for everyone, as it tests patience and the need to interpret between the lines.","DEC 2, 2020",8,Horror
Midsommar,"It's a slow paced movie that keeps you waiting for the climax, and when the girls start moaning and screaming, i don't even know the right words to describe that, but it's genius, and it can be slightly underwhelming depending on how high are your expectations, and it's also not the garbage jumpscare kind of terror, so it may disappoint some people, and it's also not the most shocking movie I've watched, it's way more forgettable than other I've watched from other directors, but it's a great movie","JUL 6, 2021",8,Horror
Midsommar,"Ari Aster is a genius! I never thought I would see a film more impactful than Hereditary or as intentional as Martyrs (2008), and here's my surprise: The best of both worlds! The work has an impact from the first moments. Dani is introduced to us and little by little we understand more about what will be developed around the film. After discovering the death of his entire family, his reaction already raises the bar and changes the atmosphere of the film, which is left aside in great intensity at the moment of the discovery of culture, but returns in force later. Her troubled relationship with her boyfriend and her pathological anxiety only get worse from there. The work the director did to create an emotional connection between Dani and the audience is out of the ordinary. Her feeling seems real, her interpretation is attentive and dedicated to the role, the audiovisual effects used to ""get inside"" her head when she is anxious, confused, afraid or happy work in an organic and surprising way - apart from the details Binaurals, which increase immersion considerably. Her feelings run deep and her reactions are completely justifiable. The other characters are also well developed and add a lot to the plot. The culture shock here works in an interesting way. Everything is beautiful and attractive, calm and solemn, until the price comes to light. Ancient customs, incomprehensible in a contemporary society, present themselves and cause a strangeness that returns to the atmosphere already worked on from the beginning - in a more subtle way - and causes a strangeness that perpetuates until the end of the work. None of this would be as impactful without masterful technical work. The photography is precise, beautiful and cruel. The shots are long and organic - like the transitions, at certain moments. The scenography is creative and is not afraid to play, leaving all shyness aside. The director of photography experiments a lot, and this strange effect resulting from angles not used much helps the film's unique atmosphere. The color palette intelligently intensifies the cruelty, incorporating a shock, as the predominant colors were green, yellow and blue. The OST is not present in most of the film, but when they do appear... they elevate the suspense to astronomical levels. And of course I can't forget to mention the Grand finale. A climax never witnessed by me. All the tension of the film is wasted in degenerate absurdism. Anger, fear, anguish, discomfort. All together, in their respective stages. I've never felt anything like this, and I'm curious to know if I'll feel it again someday!","APR 21, 2020",10,Horror
Midsommar,"Oppressive. That is how I would describe this film both visually and thematically. The rest of the film following the distressing first act is so brightly lit that it's disorienting. The village of Harga barely even gets dark at night, making the setting overwhelming. Then the other aspect for me is how Dani's grief is oppressing her. The loss of her sister and parents weighs so heavily on her that she isn't able to see or chooses not to face that her boyfriend Christian is detached and completely un-invested in the relationship. This film is a slow burn and it takes its time but hits hard when showing it's horrifically disturbing imagery. Throughout I had a sense of dread, acutely so since the cast of American characters are on drugs throughout the whole thing and react as one would expect being in that kind of mindset. These horrific things like the Harga elders jumping from the cliffside and killing themselves warrants a different reaction that we see in the British couple, but the Americans are just sort of numbed to it (which itself could be a commentary on American society and its relationship with violence). This filled me with a sense of dread because I knew that they wouldn't even try to escape their fates since they are inoculated to the horrific things happening in front of them. I found this film captivating and it's deserving of a watch if you've not seen it yet.","NOV 1, 2020",10,Horror

Overall an excellent, excellent film.","OCT 3, 2022",10,Horror
Midsommar,"Florence Pugh's portrayal of grief is heartbreakingly ugly, and realistic, and so is the dynamic between her and her boyfriend. Yes, the writing certainly deserves some credit for those two things, but Florence's performance is so incredibly raw and uncompromising that you'd swear Dani was a real person. I would put her performance in this film right along aside Toni Collette's in ""Hereditary"". Both are, without a doubt, beyond Oscar-worthy. Moving away from Pugh for a little while, ""Midsommar's"" other aspects all work quite well. While the story does occasionally feature cliches within the way it chooses to dispose of its characters, the film as a whole does a good job of being interesting and deeply unique, and much of that is thanks to its bright color palette, and wonderous set design. Just as Pugh makes Dani a real figure, the cult in ""Midsommar"" is expertly built-up and detailed in their construction to the point where you feel just as terrified of them as the characters. Their actions, lore, and ways of attracting new members all feel relatively grounded, and increase the horror of the film overall. While this may not be on the same level as Hereditary, ""Midsommar"" is one more piece of evidence that Ari Aster is of modern cinema's most talented writers and directors. - Best Performance: Florence Pugh","SEP 17, 2022",8,Horror

Midsommar,"This movie might feel like a small step back by Ari Aster compared to his previous movie but it's even more ambitious and original. The idea behind the film is good. The idea is to talk about the pain of a loss, the elaboration of mourning, the distance of those who should be part of your family and the welcome from those who do not expect. But here characters feel like they're not always well written, the movie never takes flight and turns out to give the wrong idea of Sweden and its communities. Then I saw the director's cut and characters are so better written than the ones you see in theater version. Times are dilated in the first half of the movies and then rythm becomes faster and more compelling. . You feel like there are skills in Aster directing and they are more evident in the director's cut to which i give my score. Great performance by Florence Pugh. The score Is more like a 6,5 for the theater version but I will give it 7 for the slightly better director's cut and for the madness and originality of the script.","NOV 1, 2021",7,Horror

While Midsommar has a little less impact than the previous, it starts with incredible sobriety. It hit home for me very strongly, the lead character's sister and parents passing away due to her sibling's mental illness. From there, it is incredible how we see the journey to cope with grief and also the incredible strangeness of this trip and the village. Stunning cinematography and an emphasis on the emotion. Actors really worked well.

The character Dani goes through a lot in this film and she wouldn't have been able to have been such a strong character without the amazing performance of Florence Pugh. The film also was surprisingly funny thanks mainly to Will Poulter's character. This is defiantly one of the best horror films of the year.

However, there is no performance that comes close to matching Toni Collette in Hereditary.","OCT 31, 2023",7,Horror
Midsommar,"This is the type of movie where the reaction of the people around you is more scary than the movie itself. The movie is around cults, how they pull the right strings, manipulate your vulnerability and desire to ""belong"" to commit horrible injustices and to over react to upsetting things. If you believe that the end of the movie is a ""happy ending"", then congrats, you're the type of person who believes to be ""too smart"" to join a cult, but in fact you are the most easy to manipulate into join one. On a site note, never stay with someone who you don't actually love just because you feel pity for them, you're just hurting both. At the end, the protagonist just changed one toxic relationship for another. People say is a ""happy ending"" because she makes the cult kill her boyfriend by burning him alive, because he ""cheated"" (the cult drugged him and he was actually ****, but she didn't know that, the cult lied to her), but the fact she thought that he deserves to be burned alive because of that, is beyond me (or to any reasonable person with a cold head). What is scary is that people think this is ""empowering"". If the gender were reversed then they would say otherwise, which says a lot about out horrible society.","MAR 10, 2023",7,Horror
Midsommar,"I am not an avid horror film viewer (I am really scared of jump scares lol) but I gave this a chance because my friends wanted to watch a horror film and they have watched Hereditary (which I haven’t yet hehe) so they wanted to watch the follow up of Ari Aster’s work. This film is a vibrant tapestry carefully woven with disturbing imageries. Plot is predictable, yes, but the film is made for us to experience the slow burn genre. It’s amazing how Aster weaved the beauty of the set designs with the costume colors and the horror of the cult’s traditional practices. As the film progresses, Harga slowly becomes a disturbing place which is contrary on how it was initially presented. As our feelings towards Harga changes, the characters ‘ relationships are faltering as well. I think this is where Aster’s brilliance in the script sets in. He puts us in a very disturbing but beautiful ride. Dani’s smile at the end shows how someone finally found a family even though how twisted it is.","JUN 23, 2020",8,Horror
Midsommar,"What’s scary about Midsummer is how many people saw it as a happy movie. They were happy that Dani finally got what she wanted, a family. In reality, the Hårga are a cult. Pelle chose Dani to be the new member because he knew that she had no family or friends who would investigate her disappearance and was desperate for a sense of belonging. It’s funny how people are confident that they’d never get indoctrinated into a cult, yet these same people didn't see the Hårga as a cult. I’m like, “of course you wouldn’t get indoctrinated into a cult. You’re not desperate enough.” People join cults when, like Dani, their lives are in shambles. They’re poor/homeless, their family abandoned them, their family is dead, they don't have friends, they’re sick, or they’re having an existential crisis and are seeking guidance. Some people claim that the Hårga wasn't that bad because they showed Dani she'd be getting into. But, does she though? For example, of the Hårga's traditions is when their members reach the age of 72, they're no longer seen as being of use to the village and commit suicide by falling off a mountain. So, what happens when a member reaches 72, is perfectly healthy, and doesn’t want to die? Do you think the cult is just gonna let them live and die of natural causes? No. They’re either gonna force them off the mountain, sacrifices them, or exile them to the forest to fend for themselves. Since the Hårga live miles away from civilization and don't have phones or cell reception, no one can call for help. The Hårga, like all rural villages, believe in traditional gender roles. What happens when a female member is infertile or doesn’t want to get pregnant? Or a male member doesn’t want to work or becomes disabled? Cults are notorious for being ruthless to members who step out of line or can’t contribute. We never see Hårga members getting punished or tortured for insubordination in the movie because they wanted to show Dani all their good sides. Do you think Pelle would’ve taken Dani to the village if it was raining or there wasn’t a festival? No. He specially chose the perfect day to make the Hårga as appealing as possible. Dani is still trapped and will be forced to conform to their way of life, or else. People also say the Hårga is like paradise compared to mainstream American society because they could give Dani what she needed without technology. However, it wasn’t modern society that caused Dani to be miserable, it was a combination of Christian’s apathy and Dani’s sister murdering her parents. We never know why she murdered her parents and killed herself. Was she mentally ill? We’re Dani’s parents abusing her? We don’t know. Society also didn’t make Dani introverted; that’s just the way she is. If Christian were a better boyfriend, and Dani had better friends, Pelle wouldn't have targeted her for indoctrination. There's also been debate on whether or not the Hårga are a cult. They are, but not in the way we think of cults. They're similar to the Amish. They can claim to not be a cult since the members are allowed to leave. There's even a tradition called Rumspringa where Amish teens can choose to either stay or leave the village. The problem is both the Hårga and Amish's way of life is completely incompatible with the outside world. If any of them did leave, where could they go? They don't have driver's licenses, passports, dental records, social security codes, birth certificates, education records, or any form of official identification. As for work, the only thing they could do is low-skill factory work, be a maid/housekeeper, or a farmhand. People who were born and raised there are unlikely to leave because that would mean abandoning all their friends, family, and the only life they've ever known. Even though they're not technically hostages, their culture makes assimilation with the outside world is almost impossible. That's why a lot of them say, ""Why would I leave? I have everything I need."" This is why we see none of the Hårga leave, even though they could. That's why self-sustaining cults are dangerous.","JUL 8, 2021",10,Horror

It's more existential horror than slasher horror and I imagine many don't realize why they're so upset. It is thematically and symbolically dense and has the kind of aesthetic detail and nuance that, like the Shining, will never lose its contemplative appeal.

It's a beautifully shot film, with an intriguing story line, but the positive elements get completely overshadowed by the fact that red flags are presented to each of the characters early on into the film, and yet they choose to continue on as if everything's cool. And we're supposed to believe that because there's tension within the group? It just doesn't cut it. I mean, seriously -- your friends go missing for 24 hours, following one of the characters witnessing the girl whose fiance left her out of nowhere running and screaming for her life. While some random dude interjects and is just like, ""If I may, there was a misunderstanding and I drove her to the station myself."" And then Christian is missing his friends, sees his girlfriend hoisted up like a God, is all alone and is like, ""Screw it, I'm so vulnerable right now I might as well drink this random concoction and trip my balls off while this freaky redhead tries to take advantage of me."" And Dani is so drugged up at the end that she concludes Christian's actions of cheating on her, clearly performed under complete duress, warrant his execution by immolation? Yeah, I get it, she was the perfect candidate with the loss of her family. But shock value with Ari Aster can only get you so far. I saw it with Hereditary's limitations, and it was front and center again in Midsommar. Slow paced scenes of brutal depictions of death isn't always artsy, sometimes it just looks as an attempt to make up for a more profound effort at creating an unsettling vibe. Anyway, Aster clearly watched The Witch right before getting to work on this one, because you could have seen this plot play out from a mile away. I'm hopeful that he doesn't keep recycling old material involving vivid scenes of brutality and people staring for inordinate amounts of time in shock.","JUL 3, 2019",5,Horror
Midsommar,"Midsommar: Scream or Stream? The Stream: For a movie designated mystery/horror, the film was lacking in execution of both. The Big Screen: The cinematography is top notch/Oscar-worthy. The Final Bill: The movie delivers in weirdness but execution with suspense/horror is lacking. -S2S Midsommar is Director Ari Aster’s follow-up film to Hereditary. Hereditary (check our review in facebook review archive) garnered some mixed reviews, but most were positive. Let’s see if Midsommar can continue with that momentum. Unfortunately, I don’t believe it will. There are many things I could say that are bad about this movie, but let’s start with the good. The movie’s cinematography, especially when set in Sweden, is mesmerizing. Almost every shot is done intentionally and artfully. One of my favorite shots, occurs early on and is insignificant to the plot, but I just remember thinking the use of a drone was dope. You go from riding in the car with the characters to flying to floating upside down then coming back to reality in the matter of moments. This was just one of the cool shots throughout the movie. Outside of the cinematography, the only other good part were the random villagers. They were on point. I can’t say the same for the actual cast. The villagers are fascinating and spellbinding. They are the magic of the film, but beyond them, there comes issues. The first issue with the movie was the main cast. Do not get me wrong. They were not horrendous. They were just not good. I truly believe, if the movie were cast (or directed) better, my feelings of the movie would have been different. It: Chapter 2 was a trailer prior to the movie. I couldn’t help but to think that if that cast were in this movie, we might be talking about an Oscar rather than a Razzie (no, it’s not that bad). Each actor seemed to fit their character; however, each individual character was lacking or felt insignificant. Either way, each character had limited development; and, except for Dani (Florence Pugh) in the beginning, you ultimately don’t care about the characters. It’s hard to get engrossed in a movie you barely care about what happens to the characters. On top of the poor character development, the thing everyone came to see was missing, the suspense/mystery/horror. Let’s start with what there was of the mystery. (NO Spoiler Coming- all info comes from the Trailer see above) We know something went wrong with Dani and that’s why she’s deciding to go on this trip. But why and how does it fit into the overall storyline? We know they are going to a commune in Sweden where there is a interesting summer tradition. What are the traditions, the meanings and what is going on? These questions keep rolling through your mind throughout the movie. That’s where mystery ends. Everything else is either predictable or straight forward (if you take random villagers at their word). For as weird and psychedelic as it tries to be, the movie lacks imagination, especially after Hereditary’s randomness. I’m surprised this director had an issue with imagination and originality. There are a couple shocking moments but even more anti-climatic moments. The movie feels more stagnate than suspenseful at times. In addition to that, for horror fans there are only 2 minutes worth of material that could be considered scary out of a 141 minute runtime. Talk about too long for too little payout. This was quite a letdown compared to the enthralling trailer. The only hope is that Hereditary and Midsommar are actually a part of a connected trilogy or universe. In a nutshell, this movie looks beautiful but isn’t worth spending the money in the theater UNLESS you enjoyed Hereditary. The movie delivers in weirdness, but execution with suspense is lacking. Wait for this to come to Netflix and do not expect to be scared or surprised.","JAN 27, 2020",6,Horror

It's a slow pace movie with goodish character building (some of them are just there with no explanation). But it's predictable as hell. From the start of the movie (around 30 minutes in) you know what will happen and you just expect it. For me this is the worst thing that you can do to your audience. The gore is there just to shock you. in the last hour I was distracted by other things in my room and that means that the movie lost my attention. Finishing my humble opinion about this.

I say unfortunately because Asay has some directorial (and writing) qualities out of the ordinary, with an exceptional ability to create tension. But if the beautiful first short part of the film makes you think you are at the consecration of an artist, the second part, that takes a completely different path from what we saw earlier, is lackluster and takes refuge in situations seen in too many films and to become more and more a bad copy of ""The wicker man"", with an ending that makes you smile rather then letting the viewer think, or put anxiety. It would seem almost as if two different scripts had been joined. The photography is beautiful but points excessively to aesthetics and symmetry even when there is no need for it, ending only in a mannerism. Too bad, because I repeat, the first half hour left us thinking about another great film","JUL 30, 2019",5,Horror
Midsommar,"Midsommar is a glimpse into the sadistic world of what happens when you take dark folklore and mix it with hallucinogenic drugs. There is a lot to like here from a cinematography standpoint but with a lack of character substance to make you truly connect and or feel any emotion toward the Hårga nor the group of Americans. Least of all Dani, who is abysmal is every respect as a character with no redeeming qualities to be spoken of. Her companions all had their flaws, Christian especially but to let him be sacrificed in place of a random cannibal cult member is absurd and outside of rational thought. The ending I am assuming is saying that she has let go of all of her problems in a symbolic moment of purity by flame but also incites that she is now one with the Hårga. I can't wrap my head around how this movie got such rave reviews. To sum it all up: Pros: Cinematography and Music that help you feel as though you are there and also have taken the hallucinogens that the cast has due to the bizarre breathing effect that seems to become more and more omnipresent as the film reaches its bombastic conclusion. Cons: Lack of character depth and non-sensible story line that will leave most who watch it with more sighs than anything else. 5/10","APR 12, 2020",5,Horror

Midsommar,"""Hereditary"" director Ari Aster follows up his 2018 stunner with ""Midsommar,"" another twisted jaunt through the world of paganism and the occult. On a technical level, everything that made ""Hereditary"" so memorable is retained. The shot composition and camera movements are incredibly well-executed and vibrant. The effects are horrific and indelible. The acting is superb, featuring Florence Pugh's finest work to date. But what separates ""Midsommar"" from ""Hereditary"" is something a bit more intangible -- the stories vary too different in terms of efficiency. Even at two hours long, ""Hereditary"" feels as though no moment is wasted, with every scene building to some sort of reveal or twist. ""Midsommar"" suffers mightily from an excess number of scenes, elements, and even plot threads and characters that needn't be there, ultimately dragging the pacing down and inflating the running time to at least a half-hour longer than I feel it needed to be. Aster also goes AWOL a few too many times here, which was a trifling blemish in ""Hereditary"" that's evolved into a full blown blister ailing the entire third act of this movie. Whereas ""Hereditary"" featured only a couple of scenes/moments that made my audience chuckle or scratch their proverbial heads, ""Midsommar"" has at least a good handful or so that had my theater rolling in laughter at what I'm not even sure are intentionally comedic beats. I know that comparing a filmmaker's movie to their prior work is a bit unfair, but it's all I have to go off of at present. This could have benefitted from a thorough rewrite, in my opinion, but I still thank God there are studios like A24 to champion the unique visions of filmmakers like the one at hand here.","JUL 8, 2019",5,Horror

Midsommar,"I found this movie frustrating to watch and VERY long. It is certainly not a horror film, but rather a kind of quasi-religious experiment. The actors did a fine job with what little they had to work with, but the lack of clarity (not necessarily a bad thing in a movie) was irritating. Ari Aster telegraphed right from the start that things were not going to end well, but the problem was I didn’t really care about the characters and kept trying to guess if I was watching some kind of sociological experiment gone wrong or just a failed film. I kept hoping the film would get better (or shorter). It didn’t. It just ended to everyone’s relief.","JUL 3, 2019",6,Horror
Midsommar,"While Midsommar absolutely serves up some beautiful cinematography, unfortunately the film fails in many other areas. The acting is amazing. The entire cast is what keeps this film intriguing. Not much else does. I was someone who, while I was very uncomfortable, really enjoyed Hereditary, minus the ending, so I was hoping Midsommar would give me another satisfying film. So, I don’t want anyone to think I’m being overly harsh. For me, the film was nothing but a bunch of beautifully, disturbing images without any substance. If you enjoy Florence Pugh and the rest of the cast, than I’d say proceed with caution because they’re about the only good things about it. In my opinion, skip it, don’t waste your time. Just watch Hereditary again.","AUG 12, 2021",4,Horror
Midsommar,"The movie starts out underlining how bad of a boyfriend Jack is for having the audacity to even considering his own mental health and lifegoals amidst his girlfriends(Dani) breakdowns, and need for his constant support, regardless of his own needs, and capacity. Love is a two way street right? Not according to this movie, which it plainly states during a phone between Dani and her friend. In the end they torch Jack, because he was selected by Dani as a sacrifice. It was his own fault for being an unfaithful **** I guess. The movie is trying to send a message about community, and togetherness, in today's individualistic oriented society, which I can appreciate, but I could've been without the typical tropes of masculin ambition versus female sensitivity, which is an extremely simplistic way of looking at relationships and the way we interact with each other in modern society. Watching this movie, I kinda felt I was being force fed a ""woke"" manhating statement. Great acting though, especially by Florence Pugh.","NOV 9, 2019",4,Horror

If I were a character from the movie, I would have easily been suspicious, but eould still be sold for the well-implemented aesthetics. This capitalist world has been so bland, and this movie just rekindled a childhood thought from me. As a psychedelic enthusiast, I got nearly mesmerized by the tunes the cultists were celebrating to. However, the ""paganism"" presented in this movie is **** like in The Wicker Man. To see what I mean, watch Thulean Perspective's Wicker Man review on Bit Chute.

There were some disturbing scenes in this movie but overall I found this film to be kind of all over the place. There were a lot of plot points that were introduced and then just never flushed out. I'm all for ambiguity but I felt like some scenes didn't contribute to the story at all. I did not like any of the characters at all other than the main lead. I thought that the two friends bickering about their project was so unnecessary and childish. I couldn't relate to the culture or the experiences of the characters in the movie which may contribute to my low score.

There should've been a clearer and deeper progression of Dani's arc in order to make her final decision more impactful as a moment. AND/OR there should've been a deeper dive into the culture of this Scandinavian society by expanding on the meaning of this grand ceremony and focusing on the idea of life-cycles which drive these people to murder and mutilate their guests. By cutting some of the unnecessary scenes addressing the dynamic of Christian's friend group there would be room to expand on Dani and this twisted, but somehow, beautiful culture; sharpening the focus of the film.

Midsommar,"Midsommar was a film I went into excited for, wanting to see what twisted creation the mind of Ari Aster was able to put on screen and went into the film expecting to see a film in a style similar to his above-average directorial debut, Hereditary. This film, marketed as a horror film, turned out to be less horror and more of a drama about relationships and the difference of humanity. Parts of this film feel more like a black comedy and you never really feel all that scared. The acting is fine, but the dialogue is forgettable and some set pieces that are clearly trying to elicit emotions of terror and fear are instead met by feelings of comedy. The setup of this film is excruciating long and unnecessarily complex, with many of the more interesting plot points of the introduction being sidelined or not at all mentioned in the future. The pacing is also ridiculously slow resulting in me forgetting that it's a horror movie. In order to make up for the lack of truly horrific elements, this film instead chooses to go overboard on the gore, which honestly (while disgusting) has little effect. Gore does not equate to scary. The plot is extremely predictable and the character's are just as forgettable as this film's dialogue. Certain elements feel completely unneeded while others are drawn out too long. Hereditary was a great example of horror as it preyed on your expectations and subverted them. This film plays it safe and the plot could likely be predicted by anyone who knows anything about a stereotypical ""cult horror"" film. While it is easy to be harsh on this movie, there are certain elements that work nicely for it. Pugh's performance is the strongest out of all the characters, the soundtrack succeeds in creating the eerie mood this film aims to create, and the cinematography is absolutely brilliant. While these elements are most certainly impressive, they get weighed down by the criticisms above. Overall, Midsommar is nothing short of a disappointment, choosing to focus on boring plot points and forgettable characters while brushing the more interesting parts of the setup to the side. This film fails as a horror movie by being, in all areas save for gore, quite dull, and is quite a forgettable experience. It also fails as a drama or a comedy by doing neither one effectively. In total, what you get is a mediocre film that tries to convey a theme, but does so with varying levels of success.","FEB 23, 2020",6,Horror
Midsommar,Very long and boring inbetween interesting events. Nothing really happens but loved the scenery,"SEP 17, 2021",4,Horror
Midsommar,"I can't recall the last time I watched something as frustrating as this film was. Midsommar, like Hereditary before it, has proven somehow to be boring, confusing, cheap, offensive and pointless all at once. I can certainly see where this film could be misconstrued as, ""deep"". After all, it's plenty strange, eccentric and mysterious. However, it's clear upon actually finishing the thing that any ideas one might have had, that there was a point to it all, was misplaced. And before we proceed, I'm no enemy to the, ""deep"" horror film. I'm quite the fan of The Babadook. The difference, primarily, here, is that that film uses the horror genre as a means of exploring the deeper themes. The ""deeper"" themes here are a thin excuse for horrible, disturbing imagery. And these are very much not the same thing. While we're on the subject of whether this movie has much to say, I'd like to talk about the overly graphic gore of the film. You see, I don't mind slasher films that lean heavily on grotesque imagery in order to make one's skin crawl. But most of those films are rather aware of what they are. Unfortunately, this film has so little shame that it feels the need to masquerade with it's agonizingly slow pacing and discussion of (made up) swedish culture. And yet, that doesn't stop it from selfishly wanting to have it's cake and eat it too. The film's ""horror"" is entirely in these graphically violent scenes, with heads being mercilessly crushed, bones pushed through the flesh, faces torn off, people burned alive, people being cut into pieces while alive, lungs pulled out through the back... The list goes on and on. This makes the film decidedly... Cheap, if not outright manipulative. And now that we've segued in the direction of manipulation... Wow. This film is much more offensive than ridiculous slasher films portraying sex and drugs and teenagers as evil... It would seem to like you to believe that Swedish people are horrible as well. The film revolves around American students going to Sweden, only to be killed in gruelingly brutal ways by these swedish pagan folk. It twists (and outright invents) swedish traditions into such alien, strange things that it would be hard not to think of it all as simply, ""evil"". And if the only thing you can think of to pull upon, in order to scare people, are other cultures, then you're just carrying the flag of xenophobia unabashedly. And trust me, this film does not do these things with the intent to subvert expectation or as satire, either. Everything is played quite straight, unfortunately. But that's far from the end of this film's sins, though you would be forgiven for thinking that this was enough, already. Because this film is, believe it or not, at the end of the day... A very pretentious ripoff of The Wicker Man. Don't believe me? Both films see Americans heading to a Scandinavian country and observing seemingly strange customs and rituals while attempting (or not even attempting, in the case of Midsommar) to unravel a mystery there. Both films revolve around the Midsommar festival. Both films include violent sacrificial rituals. Okay, okay, that might all be mere coincidence, of course. The final ritual of both films feature a man inside of a bear suit being burned alive, while the pagans look on, mocking their dying pains. If this schizophrenic, idiotic, offensive, pointless film could have afforded to be ONE thing... You'd think that would be, ""original"". In conclusion, as I very much cannot wait to never have to waste another moment thinking about this putrid waste of time and effort and film, let me say this above all else... I will never watch another film by Ari Aster.","MAY 21, 2021",0,Horror

They're also terrible people, for the most part. The main characters boyfriend, for instance is not only a terrible, insensitive boyfriend, but he's also a terrible friend.

The main theme: a diverse group of friends is sacrificed because white people bad. Needless to say that this movie was praised by the usual clique and received its planned 6 million awards and nominations. The movie is very slow. The scenes kept dragging on with boring scenery. The acting was high-school grade. The entire movie was high-school grade. Even Florence Pugh was a huge letdown. They appeared unmotivated and certainly uninspired. The movie tried to be clever by depicting foreshadowing imagery here and there. But it was too obvious. By now the movie industry ridiculed every culture out there except for the Hebrew one. But European culture cannot be ridiculed enough and so it continues. Make no mistake, this movie is a goal oriented project and the goal wasn't to make a quality movie. Actor Jack Reynor insisted on being filmed in full frontal nudity. Because women are too much depicted as objects of torture in horror movies. Now what an amazing White Knight hero! Yes, you'll see a few interracial couples as well, don't you worry. I don't recall **** though, but they made the black(est) guy the most educated one. Surely that counts for something.

Here's his quote about this movie: ""Sweden was an isolated place for a long time and what you see now is events unfolding similar to events in World War 2."" He claims nationalism is rising in Sweden. I notice countries in the west take turns to be accused of that. Ari also loves to fulfill the nudity quota. 1) In Hereditary we had nude cultists at the end. 2) In this movie we had nude cultists at the end. 3) In ""The 9th Gate"" we had nude cultists at the end.

Midsommar,"A family reunion in a Scandinavian village becomes a bloody pagan slaughterhouse wherein the foreign guests become human sacrifices. We haven't seen this before? Sure we have. Leaving the auditorium after the movie, someone snorted ""Nihilistic garbage,"" and I think that was a good appraisal of the film. The movie is tedious and predictable and gratuitously gory. It also has distinctly anti-white and anti-Christian undercurrents. In one advertising image, two young people are walking through a lovely pastoral setting toward what appears to be a wooden cross. What unsubtle message does that send about Christianity, in general? What message does it send about how the creator of this slop regards Christians? Would he have made such a movie about a village in his ancestral homeland, Israel, a movie in which the villagers are discovered to be practicing the ""Blood Libel,"" and abducting and sacrificing tourist Christian children? Of course not. In ""Midsommar,"" portraying some of the victim visitors as nonwhites -- visitors to a lily white Swedish hamlet -- is also some nasty messaging, on one level or another. Visually, this film is engaging and vivid and colorful. The story is mildly interesting, but predictable. I am nonetheless ashamed that any Christian or Swede agreed to participate in this spectacle.","APR 2, 2021",1,Horror

It,"""It"" was entertaining overall, scary at times, visually appealing, but lacking in an overall artistic vision. Since I do recommend seeing it, and there are plenty of good aspects of the movie, I'm going to focus on the few things that I thought really missed the mark. The movie is obviously supposed to be horror at heart, but the horror elements were often undermined by misplaced comedy. During the more intense moments, where life is literally on the line, no kid in real life is going to be joking around about something stupid in that moment, but in ""It,"" it happens pretty routinely. It really undercuts the believability and breaks immersion when this happens, and makes you wonder what the director was trying to achieve. The other gripe I have it with the storytelling. Before major events, usually you have some lead-up or foreshadowing so that when a character does something significant, you know why they are doing it. In ""It,"" the characters were often doing some pretty major actions with seemingly little reason to do so. There are also a few parts in the movie that only make sense if you have read the book or have seen the original 1990 movie, making it so that this movie doesn't entirely stand on its own. Misplaced comedy and shortcutted storytelling aside, this was a pretty entertaining movie. The visual effects and locations were well-done and creepy, and it made me jump in my seat once. So, go see ""It,"" but expect to see a very ""hollywood"" release, for better or for worse.","SEP 10, 2017",6,Horror

The story was kept interesting thanks to the angle we got on it through a bunch of different characters. Although some scenes were to be predicted since they were to be foreseen, it still succeeded to surprise at some moments.

It,"A diabolically unlaughable clown. When children of all ages begin to disappear mysteriously in the small and the acerbic town of Derry, a clan of little boys, self- recognized under the pseudonym of The Losers' Club, will have to face their biggest and most remote fears, coming in the form of saffron hair, creepy nose, accused forehead, manipulative eyes and puffy balloons with great amounts of terror. Now, say hello to Pennywise! After Will Poulter dropped out, Bill Skarsgård was the one who seized with propriety and promptness of the star antagonistic role. His Pennywise is rogue, disturbing and dreadful, however, having to keep solid his function of film adaptation, the character relegates his duty to produce fear in order to have a preference for a more fantastic vision, utopias that seriously impair the impact it must have in the genre. Most of the jump-scares coming from Bob Gray are discredited by the perceptible and even crappy CGI saturation, however, ingenuity and originality in the introduction of each of his appearances is laudable and is one of the most remarkable and spooky facts as far as horror is concerned. It's disappointing to testify that despite his performance full of strength and magnetism, he never managed to reach the levels of glory of the opening sequence. After the abrupt and disquieting Cary **** departure, Andy Muschietti is put behind the cameras impregnating his hoarding touch for horror in every frame, marks revealed by impressive Hollywood debut ""Mama"". It has to be recognized that Muschietti fathoms the ways to conceive and play with the camera in order to set up an in crescendo atmosphere, Besides having a critical eye to conceive beautiful visuals and moving characters, however, the filmmaker loses control of the film at the instant that sets aside the importance and coherence of the story by cheap and ephemeral scares. It's also worth highlighting a **** mixture of genres and original tension sequences, having the ability to revolutionize the ablatives of the audience in the twinkling of an eye. In addition to being the greatest pillar for the movie, he proudly exhibits clear references to today's horror film; to name just one: ""The Conjuring"" universe, with the use of infinite horror tricks, in fact, one scene and one character resemble some particulars of the third installment of Wan's world. The under-age actors are, far and away, a mass appeal for the plot, their performances are sparkling and touching in the formation of the audience-characters fundamental link. While the infants will always be much more likely to create a true connection, the young septet achieves a relatively high-performing level, however, many of them do it with sadly stereotyped characters as Finn Wolfhard's big- mouthed comic relief (Richie Tozier), Jeremy Ray Taylor's loving and credulous paunchy (Ben Hanscom) and Chosen Jacobs' tormented boy (Mike Hanlon). But the tradition is broken with tremendously novel characters and zero clichés as the tough-minded and human protagonist Jaeden Lieberher (Bill Denbrough), the incredibly Jewish Wyatt Oleff (Stanley Uris) and, of course, Sophia Lillis' subversive and bad-ass role (Beverly Marsh), who is certainly one of the most fascinating female juvenile performances in recent horror. Written by Chase Palmer, Cary **** and Gary Dauberman, of course, on Stephen King's legendary pedestal, the story and script are below average in general terms. They choose to focus attention explicitly on the meetings between the members of the club and the Dancing Clown, giving sub-plots of dramatic weight to the supporting characters, in addition, the self-same main character doesn't get a short mention about his mother and father, it merely presents the moral and emotional conflict with his traumas, comrades and his little brother. Andy Muschietti doesn't disappoint, but sadly he doesn't overwhelm us. His remake/revival of Pennywise tale, which will come in only two installment, provides sufficient amount of fidelity in the visual field, however, the movie clearly fails to show its narrative aspects and horror tools, which fall apart, gradually, because of the sudden ton of fantasy that stifles the last act. For habitual audiences, ""It"" (2017) will endure breaking records thanks to an efficient marketing campaign, global childhood nostalgia, the sincere literary followers, the great doses of suspense and traditional jump-scares, however, for the most draconian and true lovers of the genre and the works of the author, the film doesn't really explore new horizons, besides, suffers from a lack of true horror nuance, slighting it by drama and suspense experiences that leave us a sense of nonconformity and even sadness when we see rolling down the closing credits, due to the abrupt ending of the story that does not have the same horror dimensions as the acts of its evil villain.","SEP 24, 2017",6,Horror

It,"It has seen an unprecedented amount of attention. You would think that something seen in all the marketing and ads makes the movie something different, that it does something revolutionary, that it improves upon previous horror movies while paving the way for more terrifying adventures led by loveable kid characters. Well you would be right, to some degree. The story features a collection of teenagers living in the small American town of Derry. At the beginning of the movie we are shown the younger brother of their leader, Bill being brutally murdered by Pennywise the clown who dwells in the sewers. This sets off a chain of frightening and creative scenes where each member of the losers club is faced with Pennywise taking the form of their greatest fear. They then make the collective decision to pursue the clown and kill it once and for all. The story says relatively uncomplicated which means there aren't too many times where you find yourself confused. There are also plenty of scenes where the characters are able to bond with one another and grown their relationship. Each actor gives an outstanding performance and work the personality of their respected character flawlessly. There is no sugar coating with the characters who all have social, domestic and school related problems. This makes them easier to connect with given that they all have problems they cant outrun much like ourselves. Bill Skarsgard also gives Pennywise a quirky yet demonic personality which differs only slightly from the performance given by Tim Curry. They both relish in terrorising these children but Skarsgard proves noticeably more sinister and serious. I am not saying having a more serious Pennywise is a bad thing but it only makes him more similar to hundreds of other serious faced, emotionless bad guys from other horror movies. But Pennywise wouldn't be anything without his fearsome talent. It has scares by the dozen and each one is as creative and spine-chilling as the last, each one manages to connect with something deeply feared by their corresponding character wether it be Bill seeing Georgie decay before him or the Leper chasing Ed, a child with OCD. Rarely is any blood shown which only highlights the situation and effects when it does make an appearance. But for every scare the kids are faced with there is a real life problem to go along with it, this makes the idea of conquering pennywise represent tackling our own fears and problems in real life, and the best way to do it is as a team. It is not a flawless movie. The story has many moments and details that feel quite useless and add nothing to the story, this wouldn't be so bad if they added to the humour or added more depth to the characters but they don't which only drags the movie on for longer. As I have said before I am quite fond of the scares in the movie but they are also guilty of jump-scares, a notoriously cheap way to scare the audience. About seventy percent of times you will hear a scream from the audience because of a jump, a mistake the movie also makes is how surprisingly well the kids seem to deal with life with Pennywise. Every time a terrifying scene concludes we see the characters doing something completely normal where they appear unaffected. This manages to lessen the impact of any scares and makes Pennywise seem like a nuisance than a threat. So in conclusion, It is a fresh and uniquely scary take on the Stephen king novel and one that is well worth your money and your appreciation.","OCT 5, 2017",6,Horror
It,"The film plays like a haunted house, going from spooky supernatural set piece to another but never having the ambition or creativeness to do much more than that. The story plods along in a predictable fashion, crafting a series of contrived coincidences for this band of misfits and outcasts to come together, then slagging a bunch of derivative horror and teen drama cliche on top. This includes the splitting up of groups in obviously dangerous situations, the breakup of friendships followed by their inevitable reconciliation in the last half-hour, competing love interests, oh and there's even a 'power of love' scene in here. The film makes a point of depicting the monster of 'It' as the representation of each character's fears, visible only to themselves and those they confide in. The monster disappears after the protagonists face their fears and overcome past grievances, and I guess this is the film's way of showing the struggles and uncertainties during our coming of age. It's a period of growth and transition that can seem nightmarish at times, and hopefully we come out the other end stronger as the protagonists of 'It' did with newfound resolve. These characters however are otherwise fairly one-dimensional because once you get past the whole 'what is their fear' thing, there's not really much else about them besides typical teenage stuff and cheesy comebacks. When you get to the actual horror part of the film, what's there is mostly just Pennywise doing weird crap, gore and jump scares.","JUN 30, 2018",5,Horror

It,"According to the Internet Movie Database, there were forty four remakes, sequels or reboots released, or are to be released, in 2017 alone. For those of you who are bad at math, that’s almost one per week. Why we as a society keep revisiting stories that have been told time and time again is beyond me. It, based on the Stephen King novel of the same name, is the most recent to follow this trend. The film tells the story of an outbreak of cases of missing children in the same town of Derry, Maine during the summer of 1989. It opens much like the original, with the young Georgie losing his paper boat down a storm drain. If you’ve seen the original or read the book, you know where this is going. I will say that this was the most tense and unsettling scene in the entire film. This is primarily due to the amazing performance of Bill Skarsgard (Hemlock Grove, Atomic Blonde) as Pennywise, the dancing clown. Not since Heath Ledger’s turn as the Joker has someone taken a role previously played by another actor and truly made it their own; breaking the mold and exceeding all expectations. Even without saying a word, Pennywise is creepy as hell and sure to give anyone with a fear of clowns plenty of nightmares for the rest of their lives. While the character is featured prominently throughout the film and steals the show any time he is featured, he is simply not in the film enough. With a running time over two hours, you’ll see Pennywise for approximately 30 minutes of it; mostly during the climax. The remainder of the film follows “The Loser Club,” a group of young friends that are social outcasts and spend their free time exploring sewers and evading the local bullies. While the young group of actors displays a wealth of talent, especially Finn Wolfhard (Stranger Things), the writing and pacing is extremely lacking. Most of the film is spent dealing with horrors our heroes face that are not so supernatural, such as abusive parents or the previously mentioned bullies. I found it strange that out **** of more than five kids, you only see a small number of their parents throughout the film. I’m unsure if the parents are taking a page from the Liam Neeson book of parenting or really were that uninvolved in their kid’s lives, but it distracts from the story. Additionally, 2 of 2 dad’s you meet in the film are portrayed as pedophiles, which does little to confirm whether the kids were really seeing Pennywise or they were using him as a scapegoat for their fears. Unlike some of my GBG comrades, I am not a fan of the 80’s, but I was able to recognize a number of callbacks and small details that did make the film feel authentic. From the music, cars, costume design and set pieces, the 80’s setting is believable. Even down to the Molly Ringwald-ish looking Sophia Lillis, this feels like a movie released circa 1989. You’ve likely already decided if you are going to go see It or not, but as someone who holds high respect for the original, I found the remake to be lackluster on most fronts. I would strongly recommend that if you are interested in seeing the film, wait until it’s released at your local Red Box.","OCT 5, 2017",4,Horror

It,"This film doesn't work because it doesn't add up to anything. It's another in a long line of recent ""franchise-y"" films that are more about their existence than about anything resembling a coherent story or theme. This film, taken on its own terms, is about a boogeyman who's mostly a clown and a group of kids who find his house to bludgeon him to death. That's it, and even that's pushing it. Yes, Pennywise says that famous catchphrase about floating, and even better the movie interprets it literally, as if the quote exists outside a reality tied to story, character, or theme - in this film, kids actually float down in his sewer. Ohhh creepy, that's what it means. The whole thing is just a serious of intermingled ""scare"" scenes, one for each kid, wherein they are given the barest bones of character to make it work. Bill stutters, but only like once or twice and it never matters at all. Richie is a smartass, but he dresses cool and hip and is woke so modern audiences love him - his character doesn't grate at all making you wonder why he's such a ""loser"". Ben is fat, but in a fun superficial way and he's clearly not bothered by it. Mike's character might as well not exist at all (his entire raison d'etre is to have access to cattle guns). Eddie has his inhaler and uses it all of like once - he's more of a pill junkie. He seems rather charming and smart, and his mother is a bloated caricature that does nothing for his character either. Stan is a cipher. At least Beverly has a some development, but it's driven home in such a broadly obvious over-the-top way that again, it feels like a comment on people's prior conception of her character and not as a real character herself in this story. Her dad is a one-dimensional sexual predator, and her ability to overcome him and in turn Pennywise, rewards her with a damsel in distress storyline that ends in a literal kiss from Prince Charming to wake her - there doesn't seem to be any irony here either. The sequel to this almost can't exist based on how inept the storytelling in this one is - it will pretty much have to be it's own standalone film. I don't like to judge a film based on its source material, it should stand on its own, but this film fails miserably in both regards so it's a bit of moot point. The acting is uniformly good however. The kids are well cast, and do their parts well. Bill Skarsgard has potential, though it's wasted by lackluster use of him. There's some kind of shaky-cam run at the camera trick that's bafflingly inept and seems like a cop out by a story that has run out of tricks and doesn't trust an actor to do his job creating tension. A good example of this is the opening scene - little Georgie has this creepy encounter with Pennywise, and he's charming and owning the screen, when inexplicably the camera cuts to some old woman coming out of her house with a cat, then it cuts back to Pennywise and all the tension has started to dissipate. Then the movie has the ""cajones"" to literally show Georgie's arm getting torn off and Pennywise's mouth full of sharp teeth. Cut to the cat staring down at the street. That old trick - Alien first did it in 79. It's all so explicit way too early in the film and it kills all of the atmosphere and dread that could have permeated this. Why. was. there. so. little.

It,"""Beep Beep Richie!"" I'm not much of reader when it comes to books. The reason why I couldn't care less when a book gets adapted into film, because not every word is gonna translate well on screen. However, I do remember at a young age watching the 1990 adaptation starring the amazing Tim Curry. While I was never scared, due to it's goofy and sloppy scenes, but Curry performance left a last long impression on me and other people. Re-watching the TV movie didn't help to painfully realize how out dated it is. I wouldn't even call it good, just bad. If a reboot was ever needed, this was it. Now here we are today. ""It"" (2017) is a massive improvement and avoids watering it down like other terrible TV movie adaptations. While not on the same level of greatness like ""The Shining"", ""Stand By Me"" or ""The Green Mile"" in terms of quality, but compare to ""The Dark Tower"" that came out last month, this is pretty strong. It's not the scariest movie I've seen this year, as the biggest problem is the loud jump scars that feels repetitive and destroys any unsettling moments. Not to say there isn't any, just wish it stayed away from being too mainstream horror. I like how brutal and violet this got. Especially the beginning which took me off guard of how much it went that far. With no age rating holding it back, kids are acting like kids. Swearing and them physically getting hurt. There was even an attempt **** with one of the kids. As I said, it doesn't hold back on anything. Bill Skarsgård absolutely kills it as Pennywise. His appearance is both intriguing and terrifying that it can give a grown man nightmares. The smartest thing Skarsgård did was not copy Curry's performance and instead do a different take. Everything from the devilish smile, twisted sense of humor, and the demonic Scooby-Doo voice added lays to the character, giving it life. Who knows, he might be this generations Freddy Krueger. Even in the scene when Pennywise started dancing was funny, but with his head not moving with the rest of the body and eyes locked onto you, it's pretty scary. All the child actors were pretty great as well. Showing a positive future ahead of them. Finn Wolfhard, Jaeden Lieberher, Sofia Lillis, Jeremy Ray Taylor, and Jack Dylan Grazer are ones to keep your eye on for whatever they do next. The losers club are pretty much The Goonies, but better. The pacing could've been a lot more sharper, as the 2nd act really did drag.

It,"If not for the casual, improved humorous bickering, I wouldn't have cared. IT Muschetti's adaptation of the classic Stephen King novel does its best on being ""how"" it wants to be. For the attempts to reach the higher ideal might be missed repetitively but the procedure it follows and the tricks it plays, fails to hide its true side. And those sleazy parlor tricks are actually attention grabbing. Hence, the co-writer and director, Andy Muschetti's film trends top on the wall of its younger audience. Because this is how it was intended to be. Using safe, scientifically approved(!)- maybe that's a bit much- and successful methods, they are delivering the anticipated result on the table. It isn't informative, innovative or bombastic, as it claims to be. And yes, those standard scenarios are painted all over the pages in King's book, but those colors are brightened by deep themes exploring single pure emotions of daily lifestyle that gets by unnoticed. Which, by the way, is completely neglected and also negotiated for an easier and lazier theory to reach its larger audience. Muschetti also fails to scare the audience on any levels. Only few moments, when he catches you off guard, which too comes off utterly cheap in the form of narrative. Let's take an antic that comes in the middle of the film, where the Losers' Club enters the haunted house. Now, in that scenario, Bill (Jaeden Martell) and Richie (Finn Wolfhard) are stuck in a room where a poisonous blood is about to reach and bury or poison them. Agreeing to the fact that it is hokum, a bluff, intended to distract the characters, but I cannot help on defining the entire film in that scenario. For that very scene sums up the film for me. Since, knowing what it is, the film still remains lazy. As it never tries to convince the threat to you, to the audience.

The reliance on CGI, executing a villain poorly and wasting screentime for important characters was another problem. I'd go into detail, but I'd just be nitpicking and I don't want that. This film is ultimately a disappointment with little to no redeeming qualities.

It,"There was so much wrong with this movie. The chief complaint I have is the plot pacing. This film felt like a rush job, and a decent editor good have salvaged it. Everything happens too fast - whereas the original IT Part 1 explores the children's story through flashbacks where you have to wait long periods of time between Pennywise scenes (always a sense of unease and dread, so you can identify with how the kids feel), the new movie takes you from one Pennywise scare scene to the next almost within minutes of each other. When one kid sees Pennywise, the next kid sees him, and the next down the line, with no time to breathe or be terrified in between. After being intoxicated with Pennywise jump scares oversaturated by CGI and incessant music/Sound FX that guide your feelings rather than enhance them, we're stuck with drawn out scenes between the kids, most of whom are bad actors (save for Richie and Bev), and have no on-screen chemistry. There was little-to-no exposition on Henry, save for a quick scene with his father. The relationships between the children and their parents came off as boilerplate, and between each other, cliched and over-the-top. This was a hackneyed director's imitation of what he thinks childhood interaction in Stand By Me and Stranger Things looks like, minus the chemistry, plus some Pennywise and gore-porn scenes. That's another problem: this film does too much show and tell, no subtlety whatsoever. Georgie isn't just victimized by Pennywise - you have to watch him get his arm ripped off as he writhes and screams in a puddle, before a cheesy CGI hand reaches out to pull him into the sewer. Bev doesn't just see blood pour out of her sink, the whole bathroom has to rain blood. We can't just figure out on our own that only the kids can see the blood, there has to be an entire scene where it's explained. The children don't just defeat Pennywise with a timely sling shot, they give him a gang-style beatdown like he's being initiated into the Crips. Was there some good? Yes. I thought Skarsgard's Pennywise was interesting and a different type of performance than Tim Curry gave, not just a cheap impression. I just wish we got to see more of his acting instead of CGI and SFX doing his job for him 90% of the time. I loved the design of Pennywise's lair, with the pile of childhood items and floating kids. Hated the plotholes involving the dead lights - why is it that Bev can stare in the dead lights and be salvageable, but Stan can't? (presuming the rest of the plot follows along with the book) Because Ben loves her? If Ben kisses another floating kid, can he save them too? Come on.

It,"IT 2017 Andy Muschietti's mama had a strange ghost. He introduced a new appearance of ghost. I appreciated his invention to scare us although it wasn't a big hit like ""it"". ""It"" is a movie based on Stephen King's Novel and also there has already been a movie in 1990. I like big movies, it is difficult to make especially when it comes to horror. Nothing is more shameful for a director to make a boring film especially if it is horror that's because your imagination **** which means your screenplay is absurd, so the story as well as the music. I found ""it"" to lack a quality story. It is a movie about child's arm being eaten, a father seducing her daughter, a mother lies her son about a serious disease he doesn't have, a teenager's cowardice to kill a sheep. We see the same boring lights flickering, stupid disturbing soundtracks especially when something spooky is expected. Absurd nasty characters walk on streets and our teenage heroes find them real and very surprising than being scared of. Everyone reacts in a very curious manner than being scared of in the same way and the other day they hardly share their paranormal experiences among the group. I could not find although I tried my best to discover something new in the movie but every single scene is nothing more than what we have already seen even in cheap movies. I couldn not understand the philosophy of the two psychopaths in the film neither could enjoy. One is a senior kid with his bizarre mind to harm helpless weak students. And the other one is the pennywise. The floating phenomenon does not have a good explanation. I had failed every way to enjoy the film yet I failed because it felt like an adaptation of certain scenes in other horror movies. The photography and cinematography could not make me focus on the characters. There is a scene when Ben was scratched by Pennywise and we could see the bloody deep cut and he doesn't have enough reaction to it while in the next cut we see him keeping his hands on the wound. I tried my best to still keep watching such an imbalanced, distraction-full movie. I haven't read the book but if the movie is completely based on the book and of the ending is all same, then I would say it needs a better story. Better characters. I was thinking how could they hurt or kill a dead being and how or why God was silent for the evil to prevail! It would have much better to modify the story with God to contact our hero as he is going to die, as he mentions in the beginning, and to tell what's blocking him to save the floating beings, so to guide him a world between evil and good.","DEC 26, 2017",1,Horror

So instead of a badass looking greaser from the 50's we get Joe Dirt during his teenage years. The boys look really small too, especially Ben, he looks about eight years old. Beverly is ridiculously over-sexualized.

And I must say that I'm probably in the minority when I say that I did not care for this film very much at all. I didn't find it very scary at all, with all of the scare attempts coming off as ridiculously over-the-top to me, most of the child actors were all annoying as hell and almost never shut up, and the film felt too much like a Spielberg film, which isn't a compliment. Besides the music style among other things that made it feel like a Spielberg film, there so many times in this film where it felt like a remake of the film 'Super 8' (which Spielberg executive produced, but he had nothing to do with this film btw,) only as more of a horror film instead. Think about it. This film was EXACTLY like Super 8 in so many ways: In both films, kids are the main focus, with school getting out for summer, a girl hanging out with a group of boys, with the hero kid and the fat kid both having a crush on her, an unknown creature or thing killing people or causing people to disappear, the girl having an abusive or alcoholic dad, the girl stands up to the dad, but then gets abducted by the unknown creature/thing, the boys have to go rescue the girl underground/in the sewer, etc. Sounds almost exactly like the movie 'Super 8' doesn't it!? Really the only thing I can think of to say that's positive is that Bill Skarsgard gave a pretty crazy and dedicated performance as Pennywise. Other than that, this was a weakly executed, borderline carbon horror copy of 'Super 8', which was a much superior film with much less annoying child actors as well.

The tension the movie builds comes in temporary bursts and never builds up throughout the movie like you'd hope to see in a horror thriller. Even the characters seem to notice this as they can witness things that should scar them for life then practically act like nothing happened by the next day. And possibly the worst sin that a horror movie can commit, Pennywise transitions from a moderately scary antagonist I was actually excited about into a cruel parody of himself. So much so that I was honestly more bored than scared of his cackling hijinks by the end. Now for the good stuff: Whoever plays Bev is awesome and it feels like you get the privilege of seeing a hopefully great career take off. There were a couple truly good jump scares. It was a fun and funny movie about the power of friendship and sets a far better kid vs. creepy town adult feel than kid vs. fear-feeding monster. It feels like it's halfway to a decent underdog kids coming of age movie, but overall, it feels like a lighthearted attempt at horror designed to scare kids under the age of 13. The best example I can think of is this movie is The Sandlot if the characters had less dimension and a clown hidden behind the old man's fence instead of the dog.

I didn’t notice any frankly ridiculous or illogical moments in the film; it was very interesting to watch the development of the plot. Of course, the PG-13 age rating makes its own adjustments, and bloody horror like FNAF VHS was clearly not worth expecting. This is not to say that this kind of content would be superfluous; on the contrary, I would have been glad to see more suspenseful atmosphere and dark moments in the film. However, you need to understand that a significant part of the FNAF fandom are teenagers, and a +18 rating could greatly affect the box office (to the point that the film might not break even at the box office), and I consider excessive hate from loyal fans in this area to be unjustified. But even with the current age restrictions, the authors were able to make a good film that can captivate, scare, and make you laugh (in the good sense of the word). And for the song “The Living Tombstone” at the end, I personally give the film 10 William Aftons out of 10. If you are familiar with the franchise or have heard about it somewhere, I definitely recommend it.","DEC 23, 2023",9,Horror
Five Nights at Freddy's,"Basically, a film for fans of the series; great fan service, they did that very well. With this we have a film that can be acclaimed by fans and hated by audiences outside of fans of the game series. As a big fan of the franchise, I was enchanted, from the first minute to the last; and, honestly, what a spectacle this incredible adaptation and fitting of characters; they brought a meaning that makes sense to the story, a great choice by the developers regarding the development of the film, well crafted; But what was missing to be a top 10 film even for fans? An explanation, a more in-depth development about a security that no one really knows what they are doing there, few appearances of the character we most wanted to see, William Afton, although the few scenes in which he appears are crucial and good. For a possible sequel, good luck to the studio trying to fit the rest of the story together, and for us fans, we hope to see more of it. Good movie.","DEC 22, 2023",9,Horror

Taking into account the problems that this film had in development, it is understandable that the film has several errors in its script, but except for everything else it is quite good. The animatronics are very well done in that aspect, they gave them a lot of love and it is appreciated, the actors are good at acting in their roles and the references that were included in the film are also appreciated. As I said before, the film had big problems in its development, which is why the film feels incomplete and rushed, and it is understandable because it has errors in some aspects. I also feel that if the production had gone well, this film would be much better.

Five Nights at Freddy's,"I was expecting this movie to be awful due to the overwhelmingly negative score on rotten tomatoes, but throughout the movie I was pleasantly surprised. The first two acts were nowhere near as bad as I thought they were gonna be, but the third act is really bad. There is so much that feels really underdeveloped and forced. The biggest example of this is William Afton. William Afton, the main antagonist, is severely underutilized and has little to no exposition at all. He's only in it for about 3 scenes and is barely developed. He just shows up near the end, and he somehow controls the other animatronics for some reason. That doesn't get explained, he just does. I'd expect someone who has never played the games to be so confused. And I know a lot of people will say that the movie wasn't made for people that never played the games, and I understand that, but a good adaptation should be understandable even if your not a fan of the property is based off of. I still would recommend a watch, especially if you're a fan. There is a lot of fun to be had with this film.

Let's start by saying that FNAF, the game, was born as a horror film, which unfortunately the film does not do at all. It doesn't cause you any tension, the jumpscares are elementary and also very few compared to what we saw in the various chapters of the game. The story is partially well told with some original features. The animatronics were created and done wonderfully well. I also really liked when the movie makes you associate each child with their animatronic, with various characteristics that make you associate the child with their specific animatronic.

Five Nights at Freddy's,"Let me preface by saying I’ve been a huge fan of the FNAF game series and the original lore storyline behind it. I also went into this film not having any expectations after in spent years in developmental hell and being aware of the discourse between the critics who largely disliked the film and the fans who largely seem to love it. However, in my honest opinion, I feel like this movie lies in the middle; okay-ish but not great. Let’s start with the positives. I thought the cinematography and visuals for the film were fantastic. Particularly the scenes in Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, considering the diverse nature of dark lighting and colors that fills the largely abandoned establishment and having that mix of what was once a happy and fun place that turned into a cesspool of evil and violence. Additionally, they nailed the animatronics. While there were some slight variations, I don’t think it took anything away from the animatronics and they otherwise did an excellent job creating and showcasing them off in a rather practical manner and appeared very close to their original iterations in the first FNAF game. Josh Hutcherson was great as Mike Schmidt, but I felt the performances of the kids who played Abby, Mike’s younger sister, and the ghosts of the Missing Children were far and away the best of the film. Lastly, the film itself introduces us to the Dream Theory and it serves as a rather fascinating central tenet of FNAF that I feel like the filmmakers did a good job of exploring, though certainly I think a little more could’ve been done with it. With that said, now comes the things I disliked that pain me to write about. I certainly get the filmmakers had to crunch things down to a one hour forty-ish minutes runtime and were limited to having to work with a PG-13 rating, especially considering the efforts to showcase the film to younger fans of the franchise as well as to those who’ve never dipped their nose into FNAF nor its lore before. However, I felt that those both hurt a lot of the potential of how great the film could’ve been. The pacing was so uneven throughout, places where the tone did not feel appropriate for the film or scene setting, and there was plenty of subplots and characters that were either just glossed over, had no further exploration of other than surface reveals, or were criminally underutilized and felt more needed to be showcased about them. There’s also almost no utilization of jumpscares (what jumpscares were present weren’t executed great) and almost all the kills are done off-screen, both of which I felt took away a lot of that intense anxiety and adrenaline rush the FNAF games gave its players like myself when having keep the animatronics away from trying to kill you, and the scare they gave you when you failed and got jumpscared. Not asking for over-the-top scares and gore, but a rather balanced mix like what we got in the games. While Josh and the child actors excelled in their performances, there was acting by a lot of the other characters that just felt mediocre at best, awful at worst. Most notably, while I appreciate the dumping of all the lore into the movie from the games, the film utilized such an incongruous handling of elements from a bunch of the different FNAF games. Instead of going for a storyline that fits within FNAF 1-3, there were so many different characters and plot points used that seemed to originate from FNAF 1, 3, and 9 (Security Breach). That doesn’t altogether make this a horrible film. I had fun with the FNAF film and there’s plenty I liked and am curious to see more of how it’s explored in the two subsequent sequels that are planned. However, as a video game adaptation and for a bigger fan of the franchise like myself, from an objective standpoint, I can’t help but feel disappointed and let down for what we got and what more we could’ve had.","NOV 22, 2023",5,Horror

Five Nights at Freddy's,"FNAF The Neverending Nightmare is a dish full of references and Easter eggs for anyone who is a fan of the franchise. The setting, references to great characters from the franchise and fidelity in the animatronics? Here we have it and we have a lot! On the other hand, the film wastes all the potential of the animatronics and the iconic environment that is Freddy's Fazbear's Pizzeria, the scenes on the monitor that are a trademark of the franchise here become a simple reference. Regarding the lack of scenes on the monitors, I believe it is a technical choice due to the difficulty in adapting a gameplay resource. Expecting a more graphically violent film, I was disappointed with the few scenes of violence that the film delivers, a shame because there was great potential, especially when it comes to the animatronics. For FNAF The Endless Nightmare my rating is 6.","OCT 28, 2023",6,Horror

Five Nights at Freddy's,"If it is something for the kids see it, and after take for the rated R route, makes things meaningful, it will get cool, cause there’s potential. The movie feels like they wanted to take the kids movie way of narrating a story, lots holes, stuff happening and is clearly explained by words and not actions. Nothing is cryptic, nothing is strange, nothing has blurry meanings, and everything must be clear from doubt. It doesn’t feel like a horror movie, sometimes is a comedy, other times something that happens cause it should. I hope, just that with a sequel we will get the real thrill ride that fnaf should deliver. I don’t pretend the same story, but I want a story that actually get somewhere.

Five Nights at Freddy's,"Unfortunately, I don’t understand who exactly liked this adaptation. Instead of a suspenseful, scary movie for Halloween, we got a ridiculous movie with fan fiction instead of a plot. Instead of an oppressive atmosphere and skimmers, we got scenes of friendship and love, and those that did not fit into this concept. I’m not against revealing these topics, but the way they decided to show them to us makes us wonder whether this film was worth waiting so long for. 10 minutes of scary atmosphere and 2 streamers in 1 hour 50 minutes. At the moment I don’t know of a single viewer over 14 years old; if any adult really liked it, then it seems strange to me. The main FNAF audience has long grown up and expected a scary movie with an interesting plot, you just have to remember those mini-games from the game itself. They told us the plot, they even managed to scare us, it was for all ages, and definitely not this thesis work of a film college student. Even Blumhouse didn’t take it out this time.","OCT 29, 2023",1,Horror

Five Nights at Freddy's,"This is a movie made by a film corporation that is STILL underpaying and overworking its workers (keep supporting SAG-AFTA, the strikes are still going), based on a franchise made by a guy who directly funds politicians who are undermining abortion and LGBTQIA+ rights (among MANY other marginalised groups and issues) despite owing his wealth and success to his largely young, LGBTQIA+ fans. To be clear, I blame Cawthon and the higher-ups for forcing their subordinates to put out such a lacklustre product that does not live up to the hype it’s built in the prolonged years of waiting since its announcement. It had poor pacing, awkward script and dialogue deliver, far too many underdeveloped characters and plot points and a notable case of tonal dissonance. They were afraid to do anything too gruesome or scary to keep that PG rating (and probably because they had issues with following the premise of kid spirits doing overly dark things via the animatronics), and so the main gimmick this movie had going for it is tragically under-utilised despite the incredible faithfulness and craftsmanship shown in the design/construction of the animatronic suits. The set design is also impressive yet not showcased enough, especially in proportion to the other, blander settings which dominate the film. 3/10, with all the positives reserved for the efforts of the actors and staff (especially those who made the pizzeria set and animatronics), but as a whole product I cannot justify a higher score, especially considering the high expectations set by FNAF’s hype and the “prestige” of Universal Studios and Blumhouse. Cawthorn and the higher-ups mismanaged this project, and no amount of shallow profit from their content-hungry fans can compensate this movie’s shortcomings at their hand","OCT 30, 2023",3,Horror
Five Nights at Freddy's,what is this,"OCT 31, 2023",3,Horror
Five Nights at Freddy's,"The movie was built up as one of the biggest films to have been distributed by Universal and Blumhouse with a franchise that had become synonymous with its convoluted story, basic then complex game mechanics, the jumpscares that have become a staple since the first game, and of course the animatronics. But with the big success of the movie, being disliked by the audience and beloved by the fans, it's no surprise that I, as a fan of the first 4 games, did not like the movie from a fan's perspective and from the storytelling perspective. One thing to point out is that I went into the movie without any expectations going on both occasions watching it, the first in the theaters with a packed house and the second at home by myself on Peacock. The theater reactions actually swayed me for just a bit when i game the movie a 5.5 out of 10 due in part because of the genuine engagement from the audience and the reactions. But after watching it at home, the issues became fairly clear as to why this movie does not work as a faithful adaptation of the game. The animatronics were underutilized to their true potential like in the games, the 2nd act which kills all momentum and makes the animatronics a joke and not a threat, zero emphasis on storytelling or the jumpscares that were essential to the game and is purely reliant on fan service, Vanessa's inclusion in the film who's purpose is for exposition to the casual audience, a weak third act due to its predictable, rushed and disappointing endomf no buildup for a potential sequel, the pacing of the movie is inconsistent, the absence of Matthew Lillard throughout most of the movie even though he is the main villain, and without the audience reactions to hear, this movie was not even halfway decent with the best parts being the 1st act, the in-depth relationship between Mike and Abby, the look of the animatronics done beautifully by Jim Henson's Creature Shop, the opening five minutes of the movie that is truly suspense which was executed perfectly, the intensity of Springtrap and Lillard's performance, and a certain reference to another horror franchise. My favorite moments of the movie are Springtrap doing the knife wipe as a nod to Stu Macher in the Scream series pays perfect homage to his involvement in both films. And that Freddy kill? Chef's Kiss. But with those positives also comes my strong dislike for the movie in the storytelling, as it is a film that could've been great due to the first game's simplicity that could've succeeded had the movie gone a much different direction including: 1. Follow only Mike's story inside Fazbear's for the casual audience who have not played FNAF while giving smapl but highly appreciated moments that fans can remember from the franchise that could build up to a sequel 2. Mike being the one to discover what happened during 80's that forced Fazbear's to close by himself which adds suspense to him getting closer to the truth 3. Remove Vanessa entirely from the movie and introduce her later in the second or third game which gives more time to also explore the pizzeria 4. Give the audience more of Matthew Lillard as William Afton and have him be the call guy throughout the five nights trying to give Mike advice on how to ""stop"" the animatronics (and because, come on, it's Matthew Lillard) 5. Give the movie an R-rating so that the movie's kills could look more gruesome and jaw-dropping every scene and actually showing the kills instead of cutting away from the scene 6. Utilize the animatronics better when interacting with the humans and showing audience how threatening they are 7. Have the final act be a fight between Lillard in the Springtrap suit fight against Mike, brutally beating him and revealing to Mike that he is responsible for killing his brother which leads to another brawl which further reveals Afton is a person from Mike's past who Mike does not know, which sets up FNAF 2. Even though the fans know who it is, the casual audience would have a more engaging reaction to these two shocking reveals and are invested in the sequel. 8. Focus on what made the first game so iconic, the horror elements and use that to its potential I have more I could add in but these changes could be beneficial to the success of the movie and actually get more people interested in the movie as well as getting people interested in playing the games and learning the lore. I say that although flawed for its structure and character development, Willy's Wonderland is a far superior movie than Five Nights at Freddy's due to its more unique characteristics, execution from start to finish, unique designs and detailing of the animatronics, a consistent story and tone, and the intent of just making a movie with the screenplay of a passionate filmmaker about Nicolas Cage doing something outrageously stupid slike stomping a gorilla's head the urinal and receiving more acclaim from critics and audience for its uniqueness and execution than FNAF, then I rest my case.","OCT 31, 2023",3,Horror

With that being said the writing is all over the place and the acting is subpar at best. It feels like the people writing this didn't have a proper grasp of what the story actually was. I know Scott's name is all over in the credits. I genuinely believe Scott doesn't even know what's going on in his own series anymore. Glad I just watched it on Peacock instead of going to the theater like I had planned, because I fell asleep several times while attempting to watch this movie. The movie is a little over a hour and a half long and most of it's time is spent doing nothing. It's very frustrating to me because there's a lot they could have cut out to make the movie time more reasonable, at the same time there's a lot of stuff they didn't include in the film that they should have. The opening scene to me is a weird one because it doesn't really fit the overall tone of the rest of the film.

Five Nights at Freddy's,"It's unlikely you'll ever see something this incompetent, boring and slow be so highly regarded by an army of devoted online fans again - until the sequel is made at least. It's made for fans to do the Leonardo pointing meme at the screen for the rote references/ cameos and nothing more. Such is the fan power to thrust a ""horror"" adaptation that is so disinterested in trying to use what made the first game a viral sensation - possessed animatronics hunting and jump-scaring an almost helpless security guard - in favour of tedious amounts of justification for nonsensical plot points and lore exposition dumps that drag the pacing to a crawl. None of the twists surprise, all heavily predictable or meaningless (and entirely expected by lore gurus) while every jumpscare attempt pales in comparison the games. Freddy and co might be impressive practical recreations but they're utterly stiff when visible, only actually able to attack when off-screen which leads to an unintentionally hilarious dream sequence. They don't do much given their capabilities, and the cupcake gag becomes overplayed. There didn't need to be gore to be scary - just good directing, writing, staging and sound, none of which is here. Performance wise, only Mathew Lillard does anything to entertain the absurd (it always has been, just admit it) premise with a bit of hammy acting for the very few short minutes he's there. The rest are mostly monotone or poor; I never understood why Abby hated her aunt so much beyond saying she does and would prefer her disinterested brother Mike (a sleepy Josh Hutcherson), other than the sloppy writing just making her a greedy Karen who the script forgets entirely. The actress for Abby has the worst line reads of the lot and never looks frightened, while the police officer spouts exposition and becomes friends with Mike for no good reason at all. As for that directing, the individual shots and sets out of context look fine - altogether however it's a mess, as if she wasn't confident about how certain moments would turn out and just shot it from tons of different angles for no reason with mostly poor lighting. Tonally the film shifts from attempted horror to drama, back into attempted horror, drama again, then an abrupt light hearted family comedy before shifting gears towards drama and poorly executed horror final act. That resolution to the conflict... it's plain stupid. If only you could draw pictures in the games, or carry a taser. But none of this matters to anyone who has an emotional investment in the reception of this film. They've waited a long time after plenty of games, let's plays and lore videos to feast on, and they'll be damned if this film isn't an 11/10. Understanding Scott's convoluted lore doesn't make this better - only lowering your quality standards and being biased towards the IP will.","OCT 28, 2023",2,Horror

If you walk in to the cinema expecting more than that, you'll walk out being furious to the makers of this movie. Overall, I enjoyed this movie. On the other hand, the advertising clearly took a wrong direction by selling it as a franchise-starter. Studios need realize and wake up that you can't just make a movie to start a Marvel-ish dynasty. If they want to start a universe, just let it flow, don't rush it! DCEU fell to that pit with its earlier movies (Thanks to Wonder-Woman, people might actually start to get interested in that universe).

The Mummy,"Not sure why ""The Mummy"" is getting so much negative criticism. Perhaps I don't understand the backstory that true movie buffs and geeks live by; however, I enjoyed the movie very much. One prior reviewer said it was burdened with too much exposition but I feel just the opposite. They explained enough to understand the storyline but the movie was full of action. Also, I've always liked Tom Cruise and Russell Crowe performances and they didn't disappoint in this movie either. I found the movie to be fast paced and exciting/suspenseful throughout the whole thing but not annoyingly so like the neverending action sequences in ""Man of Steel"" that felt like an hour of Superman and Zod smashing each other through buildings. (I agree with a prior reviewer that liked ""The Mummy"" better than any of the DC offerings so far.) I liked the supporting cast in ""The Mummy"" and felt they all had good chemistry (did not feel the same about Henry Cavill and Amy Adams who seemed more like brother and sister). I thought Universal set-up the Dark Universe adequately but again, I'm a nube to any backstory here. I enjoyed it very much and would watch it again. I can't say that for any of the DC movies, including ""Wonder Woman"" (although in fairness I was very tired when I watched it). And keep in mind, the movie is not ""Schindler's List"". It's not meant to challenge or educate. It's pure escapist entertainment.

The Good: The Mummy has some pretty good scenes all conveniently located for your viewing pleasure in the first forty minutes or so of the movie. The first forty minutes has a good breezy pace, Cruise’s character seems fun and well thought out, the action scenes are great and the mummy protagonist is a sexy and dangerous foil. One can seriously start to wonder why this fun movie got so much critical flack? The Bad: And then Russell Crowe shows up. Dr. Jekyll would argue that Mr. Crowe does a fine job but is let down by a poor script and characterization. Mr. Hyde would say Russell is a large ham who makes a poorly thought out character even worse. While I agree with Hyde I don’t think anything could have saved this character. It is simply bad because it exists in this story. Crowe scenery chewing isn’t the only thespian stumble. We also have Annabelle Wallis as the least charismatic Cruise love interest since… well maybe ever. There is furniture in this movie I am more invested in than this character. If a bad guy ties her to a table we’re more worried that no one is using a coaster. For a movie called The Mummy, the titular character doesn’t seem to get a lot to do after they settle in London. Some (including the studio) blame Cruise for hogging the limelight but in reality, it is the world building with Prodigium, which is supposed to be the Scooby gang that links all the Dark Universe movies together, that **** up all the running time and all the films energy. (The Mummy was supposed to be the first of a series of Dark Universe films that are threatening us with, among other things, Johnny Depp as The Invisible Man. Fortunately, the whole enterprise seems to be on life support so expect another reboot soon.) There are other fails. The Crowe’s Jekyll/Hyde does that thing where Jekyll speaks with an upper-class accent so we know he is good while Hyde pours on a cartoonish lower-class Cockney accent, that would make **** Van Dyke blush, to let us know he is now evil. (If one thinks about it it really should be the opposite). This seems to be taken from the Dr. Jekyll musical of all things and Crowe does seem to threaten to sing Les Mis’ Stars at any monument. The movie um… finds inspiration from other films as well, everything from The League of Extraordinary Gentleman (See Prodidium above) to An American Werewolf in London where the film out and out copies entire scenes. In Conclusion: It is rare to see a movie, let alone the supposed start of an entire Universe filled with tent poles, fly off the rails so badly. Like Superman Vs Batman it seemed more concerned letting us know about upcoming projects and setting up “the Universe” than just being a good movie so we would see another. Raider’s of the Lost Ark did not try to create a franchise with its film. It just was a very good movie that made people want more. They had a great villain, a solid action hero and a decent budget. They easily could have made a fine Mummy film. And if it was successful they could have followed it up with some mediocre sequels that take place in China and have a new actress playing the wife in the third one. Heck, you could even do a spin-off series with horrible CGI Scorpion Man hybrid that eventually goes straight to video. The blueprint was there you just had to follow it.","MAR 28, 2018",5,Horror

The Mummy,"I liked the movie overall. At least it's been better than all the previous mummy movies and that is an achievement. Tom has at least some level of character detail as opposed to Brendan Frazer in the earlier movies where his only dialogues were 1 liners and action sequences. I also liked the fact that there's little of ""wild action"" scenes which serve more as a filler and then you forget them because they don't add anything to the plotline. I can't tell you what I didn't like without giving away spoilers. But I would say that the ending satisfying.","OCT 17, 2017",6,Horror
The Mummy,"Pros: I got a nice power nap in the middle of the movie and I kinda liked the Egyptian design of the sexy mummy and the weird movement of the skeletons. I did not dislike the mummy's performance but I think sticking to the old version would have been better for the fear factor. I was a bit disappointed in that regard. Cons: Basically everything else. I never was a big fan of Tom Cruise but in recent years he has become unwatchable with his aggressive-confident attitude. Especially in this movie, it kills all the jokes and lightheartedness. Totally miscast. He'll never be an Indiana Jones. So the movie is not funny, it's not frightening, it's just Tom Cruise cruising around and every chick in the movie is just chasing that old man. The mummy's interest in him especially makes no sense considering what happens later. Screw logic! It's just a cash-grab movie anyway. And wth is Jekyll/Hide doing in this movie? Urgh! Just awful. I see a dark future ahead for the Universal Dark Universe.","SEP 5, 2020",4,Horror

The Mummy,"The Mummy is a remake of one the classic Universal monster movies and is directed by Alex Kurtzman. This recent retelling of the story is about a soldier turned treasure hunter played by Tome Crusie, who accidentally awakens a ancient mummy played by Sofia Boutella. This film wants so much to be like the marvel films, with it trying to set up hole universe in a single movie. But that just doesn't work, you need take time to set up an entire world of myths and monsters not try to clam it in to one movie. The story on it's own would have been perfectly fine if it had the time necessary to grow. Yet the film makers seem to want to go out of their way to make the film feel rushed. Another problem is Tome Cruise as the lead. Now I have never been a Tom Cruise fan, but in this film in particular he just comes off as one dimensional and **** only thing that saves this film from being a complete disaster is the acting of Sofia Boutella she plays the titular role of the evil mummy brought back to life and she plays it beautifully, this is only the third film I've seen her in and I'm quickly becoming a fan of hers. In conclusion even though I like Sofia Boutella in this film and doesn't change the fact that film is still just a big mess.","AUG 4, 2020",5,Horror

The Mummy,"I thought there were some good moments in this movie. The movie had some intense scenes and was enjoyable at parts. The movie also had some cringe worthy moments too. Tom Cruise does a fine job, but once again he is playing Tom Cruise in this movie. Also Russell Crowe plays a small part but a surprising role, which I had no idea of. Now Jake Johnson's character never should of been in the movie and is not a good addition to it. The mummy played by Sofia Boutella is clearly the stand out here. She is very good and gives a lot of tension to the movie. She seems to be really good in everything she plays and is becoming quite a star at least in my eyes. I do feel if this movie wasn't called the mummy it would have been reviewed a little better. The movie wasn't as bad as some reviews and I think people should give it a watch.","JUL 29, 2017",5,Horror
The Mummy,"The 2017 reboot of The Mummy franchise, directed by Alex Kurtzman, is a disappointment. The film is focused on setting up an extended universe, but fails to create a world worth spending time in. Tom Cruise plays the lead character, a rogue named Nick Morton, who along with his friend, discovers the tomb of an ancient Egyptian princess who was mummified alive. The plot follows Nick's journey as he is cursed by the princess and must stop her from bringing an ancient god into the mortal world. The film is filled with exposition and dull characters. The performance of Russell Crowe as Dr [spoiler] , the leader of a monster-busting secret organization, is particularly painful to watch. The Mummy is not only a bad film, but it is also not entertainingly bad. ___________________ El reinicio de 2017 de la franquicia The Mummy, dirigida por Alex Kurtzman, es una decepción.

La trama sigue el viaje de Nick cuando la princesa lo maldice y debe evitar que traiga a un dios antiguo al mundo de los mortales. La película está llena de exposición y personajes aburridos.

The Mummy,"The first in the Universal studio's 'Dark Universe'! If you see the history, the reboots usually fails. It has to be at least half a century old to reboot like 'King Kong'. So the technology advantage would play a major role. It was less than the 20 years, the last 'The Mummy' film had released and pretty impressed everybody with modern visual effects. Even today's young generation getting used to that when it was played on the television. Comparing this to that, there's nothing much other than more perfection in graphics and additional digital 3D. In my opinion, they should have waited another decade. It was exactly reversed version of the 1999 film. I mean the character designs. Like female mummy coming to life and targeting a man for the ultimate power possession. Two US army men in Iraq found a hidden tomb like structure from the Egyptian era beneath the sand. The recovered ancient coffin shipped to England, but the plane crash down. Since then, an unknown force begins to hunt down one of that two army men. Fighting against it, followed by how the story ends comes in the later parts. When I first heard about the reboot, I said oh no! Hearing about Tom Cruise's involvement, it became double no! Actually, he was good in the film, but the film was unnecessary at this generation. Even though it did good at the box office, it was considered a decent run. But the studio has a bigger plan, that you would know if you watch the film, that they had already developed a plot for at least two more films with enough characters to carry on that long. If needed, it would add more in the latter. I feel that's a bad idea right now. Watching it one time is not bad, but no special at all. 5.5/10","NOV 3, 2017",6,Horror
The Mummy,"I went in with low expectations due to reading the early movie reviews. I felt indifferent after watching. The movie itself had me up until 2/3's of the way in, at which point the 3rd act just felt rushed. I rated it as a 5 to show as a standalone film it was just an OK, not bad or great. It really did feel as a setup movie for future Monster verse films. In regards to the acting, Jake Johnson was great for comedic relief and Sofia Boutella performed well as the main antagonist. I’m not a huge Tom Cruise fan, but I felt he didn’t bring as much charisma in this as opposed to some of his other works. In closing I think it was a passable film. I think the monster movie verse will continue on track as this first film did well in the international box office.","JUN 20, 2017",5,Horror

The Mummy,"My thoughts about The Mummy from 2017 are quite negative. As I really like the series and the first Mummy movies that appeared where very okay, this one failed for me. Sadly it seems to be a phenomenon frequently seen on remakes or franchise additions and in the case of the Mummy I should honestly have expected. Even though the metascore was already low during release, I got fooled by the trailer promising an exciting and interesting, slightly scary story as the first movie had, it didn't take long to realise that one Mummy would fail getting up to that. The big complaint about that movie that I have is simply that it is trying to be to much things at the same time. There are a lot of elements in it which are interesting for the moment they appear but in the end unimportant for the story at all. It seems to be so that the movie was cut to fit the bright audience interests, but that would totally not have been neccessarry. Even though the setting and plot seem very great at first, they are predictable, though, but good, in my opinion they have been used the wrong way, as the plot becomes worse and worse as the movie progresses solely because they tried to add more and more content, characters and backstory. If this movie would have stayed at the principles of simplism and been orientated more on the original series and not on other movies, it could have been a way more enjoyable work overall. As it currently is, it is too much of it all. But that does not mean that The Mummy is a bad movie, it's just not good and that's why my scores seems reasonable.","MAR 17, 2018",4,Horror

The Mummy,"Here, The Mummy is not the monstrous thing The surprises, keeping re-encounter with one of the classic wonders par excellence, owned by Universal Pictures, are constricted. Among this narrow mosaic of satisfactions is what would be a comforting and palpitating beginning.Trying to emulate the retributive equation created by Marvel Studios with its cosmos of cinematic superheroes, Universal plans to outline its universe by reusing the characters that must be untouchable because of their one-of-a-kind legacy in cinema history, however, Hollywood's rejection of creativity, a true eyesore deserving its corresponding movie, has begun to pick on, without embarrassment and with enough paraphernalia, the monsters in order to satisfy the demands of the Millennials about knowing those dark beings. Classics of yesteryear such as ""Bride of Frankenstein"", ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" or ""The Invisible Man"" are going to resurrect in the upcoming years with the help of Johnny Depp, Julian Bardem and undeniably a compendium of actors and actresses that are currently shining in the mecca of American cinema. ""Dracula Untold"", starring Luke Evans, was kicked off but it was harshly criticized for the loss of focus portraying the ""untold"" story of this iconic and lethal vampire. Due to this economic and reception flop, the studio didn't give up and started over with a clean slate, omitting such box office bomb, supposedly, to reorganize the pretensions and start on the right foot this mega-project, but what would be the story that would really redeem the master Dracula? ""The Mummy"". Mythology and/or legends encompass myriad opportunities and Hollywood sharp brains have been able to take advantage of these to raise the first dark universe of history. After a round of flowers and applause by films with a large audience response and a revival led by Hammer Films in the 50s, North American cinematic mecca Universal Pictures inaugurates its corresponding movie voyage with Dr. Henry Jekyll, who's the director and creator of the surreptitious organization ""Prodigium"", whose mission is to recognize, contain, examine and destroy any evil entity stepping on the ground. The first to realize her not so triumphant entry is Princess Ahmanet, interpreted by Boutella. After watching the film, one can conclude that the biggest flaw, both independent movie and inaugural work, is the feeble structuring in plot terms, because, although the introduction of the antagonist and the retrospective scenes independent Nick firmly consolidate the first act, it's difficult to feel that constant and seductive ecstatic that encompassing the Mummy, verbi gratia, in Brendan Fraser's 1998 film. Such a narrative failure originates consequents that keep on to harm the audiovisual tale; the first one comes in the name of the selfsame main actor, who had active participation in the conception of the script, for, in the end, provoke prominent interventions in the footage that should come from the true star, giving prominence to a character who will surely have weight in future installments, thus giving cause to the second big mistake: not deciding what specific genre(s) and tone(s) for the universe due to the hasty narrative ending. Is it a horror or comedy film, an initiation/Nick Morton or a mummy film, an adventure or suspense one? The film doesn't cease in production of subliminal messages for the audience on the occasion of informing of the large flow of monsters that are coming, introducing with little fluency references and signs of upcoming films. The third blemish comes from the sketch of characters, another subject in which the team of writers doesn't come out well. The Mummy's female version flaunts different presentations ranging from an inhuman entity that drags to the aphrodisiac and intimidating look that spends most of the time chained or stealing people's lives by lip contact. The places in which the tale develops tend opacity, a complex of special effects that are supported in a palette of pessimistic colors and tones in terms of transmitting, without any success, dread, and insecurity the work must produce. As for technical aspects, they stand out for the first-rate execution of the best action sequence in the film: The plane crash, although it doesn't propose anything deeply novel in the action movie matter, managed to stir within me, thanks to furious-paced timing, an unexplained anxiety for the future of the characters, a well- deserved applause for this achievement both technical and artistic. ""The Mummy"" (2017) by Alex Kurtzman is a frustrating setback and inaugural disruption in the optimistic plans of Universal. A work that could not show its possibilities because of an unsatisfactory attempt to get what Marvel's equation has built, and even DC's one. Ideas straying in the disorder of pretensions. Apparently, just as Disney, Universal must mummified already conceived plans to awaken new aces under the sleeve quickly.","AUG 19, 2017",6,Horror

The movie falls short everywhere else though. The plot is all over the place, and it stops in the middle to expand the ""Dark Universe"", and it is a waste of time. It didn't need to be in the film, and it slowed it down and cluttered it. The film also seemed to just be stumbling over itself near the end, having things happen for the sake of the plot and to find a way to keep the universe alive. Speaking of that, the ending is **** as well. The last ""fight"" is very anticlimactic, stuff happens that isn't explained and then there is narration which tells you ""We got a universe coming!"". Along with that, some of the writing is bad. The side character chick is really bland, the comedic effect guy that shows up randomly is not funny and annoying and Tom Cruise's character doesn't really develop.

I think if the movie had simply focused on her story- it would have been good. However - like many of the professional and some of the non-professional critics - The movie is trying too hard to set up the threads that will connect the ""Dark Universe"" which really detracts from the movie I paid to see. In fact - I thought the inclusion of Russell Crowe as Dr. Jekell gave it some sort of weird ""League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" re-boot vibe - which really isn't a compliment. Since Crowe is getting his own Hyde/Jekell movie - they should have saved that whole sideshow for his **** is simply a distraction here. Also - I didn't dig the ending. It brings in the bizarre idea that Cruise may be popping up in ""Invisible Man"" or ""Bride of Frankenstein"" or other - totally inappropriate cameo moments in totally unrelated **** all just got fairly bizarre and silly by the end (although the idea of that actually happening is probably the scariest thing in the Dark Universe - lol) .","AUG 26, 2017",4,Horror

It's apparently the first installment in a planned 'dark universe' franchise. And 2. to cash in on Tom Cruise's star power. The result: A noisy, cluttered, and uninspired film that can't make up its mind if it wants to be a fun, quirky action flick, or if it would rather be just plain dark and scary instead. The film shifts back and forth between these two tones quite a bit throughout to the point of becoming rather tiresome. Russell Crowe's talent is pretty much wasted with his corny take on Jekyll and Hyde. On top of all that, the film's very loosely resolved and ridiculous ending had me leaving the theater incredibly unsatisfied.

I like that the Mummy played into Nick's head but it is not always presented in a very efficient way. The others actors are average and the story is NOT scary at all. The action is pretty good but the film takes it's time to start. It seems to me that the character of Dr. Hyde wasn't that great. It's justification, the very minimal special effect of his character.

The Mummy,"What the hell did I just see? This has to be the worst movie I have seen in a long time. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the experience of going to see it. It gave me some ideas of what to do and not do in a future roleplaying game I will run, but definitely that was a big piece of trash. First let's get this out of the way. The movie isn't really about ""The Mummy"". It is a **** story for and about Tom Cruise. The Mummy character itself was given the shaft in this movie. The actress (Sofia Boutella) and the character (named Ahmanet) is what I find to be the best part of the movie. She is beautiful, powerful and even with her limited material had a great intensity. She was the only good thing in the movie. Yet she had what seemed like the least runtime out of her, the blonde girl, Cruise or Crowe. There was so much potential with her, yet they hacked her part apart so badly she seemed like a bit player in the movie. Russell Crowe was both good and bad. I like Russell Crowe, and I don't feel bad about it. I liked the witty comments of Mr. Hyde, and I realize Crowe can have a wooden performance, but in this case, the character itself was written poorly, so Crowe didn't have much to work with. Cruise's love interest (I will refer to her as the nameless blond) was horrible. She was so bad I don't remember her character or the actresses' name. To make it even worse, I don't care to know it. Her character was cardboard, flavorless and absolutely did nothing for me. I realize I can't blame that on the actress, but evidently I don't even care enough to try and get past that. Tom Cruise is problematic in a lot of ways. I like him in some roles (yes I liked Collateral and the Last Samurai). He is flavorless as well in things like Mission Impossible. Then he is horrible in movies like in this one. I hated his character itself, the presented personality, the ****, just about everything he said made me wish I could blow him up with my mind. The worst part of the movie is the fact they butchered all of the Mummy's (Ahmanet) parts so Cruise could have a larger part. I hear it is because the director was a rookie and Cruise was ""helping"" the director, but that didn't help anything at all for me. I also disliked what Cruise's character became, I realize he is the referential ""Mummy"", and I didn't consider that suave, cool or even a surprise. I was just disappointed that she wasn't the Mummy in future films (except maybe a villain). That was the biggest disappointment for me. This was the first movie in a new film franchise, the ""Dark Universe"" that combines all of Universal's monster IPs into a single Marvel/DC type thing. They want to share the universe with Dracula, the Mummy, Frankenstein's Monster, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, etc. I think that is an awesome idea. The problem here is they went too far into it for the first movie. They wanted to make references to too many things and instead there was too much explanatory setup and too little story about the Mummy. They would have been better off to have a few easter eggs of the other IPs, and maybe a cameo. Some say Crowe was a cameo, that wasn't a cameo, that was way too large a part to be anything but disasterous. The good: Sofia Boutella was a great actress, and her character was awesome. I will follow her more. The bad: Everything else was eye gougingly bad... except Russell Crowe, he was ok.","FEB 2, 2018",1,Horror
The Mummy,"This is a poor start to a new cinematic universe, and I went with low expectations and was still disappointed. There are some well-shot action sequences, and I do like what Universal is going for here, setting up a world where many different monsters coexist, like Cabin in the Woods, but what we get with this are a bunch of tired PG-13 action cliches. Oh, and I should also mention that the film is not scary at all, so that's a fail. Let's talk about the comic relief. Why is it needed? This is the ""Dark Universe"", so the tone should be kept serious, but screenwriters seem to always think that audiences want this, so we have to endure bad joke after bad joke. Of course we get the wise-cracking sidekick who seems to be trying too hard to get a laugh, but all characters get some line that's supposed to be funny but comes off as awkward, and it ruins any suspense that a scene may have been building toward. Humor especially ruined the scene where Tom Cruise wakes up in a body bag after coming back from death. What should have been very dramatic was just supposed to be funny because he woke up naked. PG-13 humor at its finest! Now I'd like to address the flashbacks to The Mummy's origin story. The flashbacks were way overused, and they begin probably no more than ten minutes after we see them originally. This is when I felt that the director thought his audience had very short attention spans and had to be constantly reminded of plot elements throughout the film. Now, as for The Mummy herself, she looks great, has a creative design, but she's hardly menacing like she's supposed to be, and her zombified minions are not much better. She doesn't have a world domination plan like Imotep from the 1999 Mummy franchise, she just wants Ethan Hunt, and that's it. Also, ripping off the face-in-the-sandstorm scene from the '99 movie was so unnecessary, and there wasn't even a good reason for it. If Universal is going to continue with a universe based on horror films, they need to put effort into actually scaring us.","JUN 15, 2017",3,Horror

The Mummy,"This is the first ""Dark Universe"" movie. It's an attempt from Universal Studios to create a big movie franchise. As an IP launch, it's a complete dud. From the trailer it looks like a big disaster flick with the ancient Egyptian goddess returning to wreak havoc. In reality, it more of an intimate encounter with lots of dialogue (there are basically only 6 characters). Tom Cruise heads the roster. He's trying to create a devil-may-care character, but it's not convincing. Meanwhile, the story is dull, the visual effects aren't unique or innovative and the action sequences are never especially original or exciting. There's nothing to recommend this movie (unless you enjoy seeing Cruise shirtless for a few seconds).","JUN 14, 2017",2,Horror
The Mummy,"Setting out to create their own cinematic universe, Universal Pictures resurrects ""The Mummy"" as a tonally inconsistent star vehicle for Tom Cruise. It wants to be a horror movie, but constantly shoehorns in humor and action reminiscent of Marvel's superhero films in order to ensure mainstream appeal. It's efforts to set up the larger world of this ""Dark Universe"" consisting of rebooted versions of Universal's classic monster properties is interesting, but muddled. It is yet unclear how everything is going to come together. That's not the problem. The problem is that after this sorry introduction, I'm not very interested in learning how. It's hard to care about anything happening onscreen. The story is a bit of a mess, the dialog is incredibly cliché, and the characters are bland stereotypes. The most interesting aspects are the horror ones, which unfortunately are neutered in order to not scare away the general public. I'm sorry, but I thought these were supposed to be monster movies. You can pretty much predict everything that's going to happen so any excitement is automatically drained away. Tome Cruise hams it up while playing his typical smarmy guy role that he's just getting too old for. Everyone else is just kind of there, including Russell Crowe who has a surprisingly minor and practically useless role in the film. Somebody's just there for that cinematic universe money (good luck with that). The sole shinning light in this whole ordeal is Sofia Boutella. While she plays a totally weak villain, she does manage to be drop dead sexy in the process and show some much appreciated skin. There's a lot going on in this reboot of The Mummy. Almost none of it is any good. It's manages to capture all of the worst qualities of a Tom Cruise movie. It's a flat, stale, and pandering effort that will leave the majority of viewers bored and wanting so much more. A poor way to kick off a cinematic universe. Universal would have honestly just been better off keeping the also vanilla ""Dracula Untold"" as their first step. While only marginally better, at least that one was likely to have more of a following. Skip this. If this one hasn't already derailed their plans, we're all better off just waiting to see what Universal comes up with next for their Dark Universe. Outside of Sofia Boutella's butt, there's nothing here worth seeing, and you can google that. Things are very ""dark"" indeed. 3.6/10","OCT 12, 2017",3,Horror

I'm a huge Tom Cruise fan, and a huge fan of the 1999 'The Mummy' film, so I had high hopes for this movie. That being said, this was a very below average film.

The Mummy,"""The Mummy"" is yet another desperate special effects-driven modern mess from Hollywood that favours expensive, pretentious, no-longer-impressive CG razzle-dazzle and awkward set-pieces designed to tease later films over a coherent and gripping narrative and interesting characters. Like many movies designed to be part of a ""cinematic universe"", it just cannot stand on its own because the filmmakers crammed in so many unnecessary plot threads relating to the other upcoming Dark Universe films that it's less about thrills and fun and feels more like a very, very long advertisement for the entire series. And that's not what a film called ""The Mummy"" should feel like. Thanks to this film I'm once again concerned about the future of blockbuster movies. New cinematic universes are constantly being planned and it's ruining the art form, making it a chore to sit through overextended movies and memorise plot threads. It's all done to keep hype constantly going, which maximises the box office grosses because everyone just wants to see what references to other movies will show up. Well done, Hollywood for once again proving to the world that, apart from the occasional surprise (see Wonder Woman) your filmmakers are no longer interested in making films for everyone - only for themselves, to satisfy their hyperactive imaginations (and wallets). I will definitely be watching more independently produced, underground and low-budget films after this because I can no longer suffer this ongoing cinematic universe trend.","JUN 12, 2017",0,Horror

The Purge,"A day in which crimes are all forgiven, for America has found new refuge under the tradition of the annual purge, a concept which toys with our inner primate selves. The Purge begins very slowly setting the scene in an eerily fashion, viewers are introduced to the normality of the purge quite quickly and it is this normality which then makes the later developments in the plot so shocking to an unsuspecting viewer. The concept is one which could of probably been delivered to a higher standard however the movie to an extent does give it some justice, with it only being 85 minutes in total leaving you hungry for more it immediately becomes apparent that ""The Purge"" is a short taster to a number of following prequels,it provides an insight into ""home invasion"" one aspect of many which could be exploited in the concept of ""The Purge"" With the whole movie being set in the house like movies similar such as ""panic room"" the director has chosen to diversify the film by using a number of different rooms on screen within the family house however due to it being set in the early hours of the morning and later developments leading to low level lighting it means that most of the movie is quite dark. Ethan Hawke plays the patriotic father of the family, an upper class family which strongly supports the annual purge however when they become involved stumble upon choices they must have to make in order to protect there family from the threat outside. The family and neighbours were poorly portrayed by their actor counterparts, it really took value away from the movie and made you want to quetion were they acting with the boy child being emotionless throughout the film and the neighbours being gormless in some scenes. Despite this I was glued to my chair throughout, the movie started slow however became quite fast moving. With me not seeing the trailer beforehand the movies events were more of a shock as they came to play and allowed for me to be more gripped. Following the credits the general consensus was positive for being such a low budget film.","JUN 27, 2013",7,Horror

The Purge,"I felt the need to write a review for this movie because in my opinion this is an underrated jewel in a genre full of gory b-movie trash that you stumble over these days. The movies base plot is refreshing as it gives the people 12 hours of legal killing time for the sake of the United States of America; ""cleaning"" out the streets. I wouldnt go over morale aspects here because we are talking about a movie which should be displayed as such. So when purge night is getting closer and closer people tend to arm and hide themselves getting ready either for survival or their very own pleasure to kill. Purge starts out a bit slow but is gaining speed over time with some nice plot twists and overall decent acting. The movie is not overly gory but compensates with a nice thrilling atmosphere as a family tries to survive at all costs loosing themselves in the process. Purge 1 is a well made popcorn cinema movie that I enjoyed the second time on 4K release which was (to me) absolute worth it. The idea is pretty refreshing and made ways for at least 3 more movies that you may enjoy even if the first one didnt get a grip on you.","MAY 20, 2018",8,Horror

I've news for folks who say the characters were ""two-dimensional,"" that may be your own reflection, your assertion does not reflect on the film in the least. I've news for folks who say the story was ""shallow"" or ""lacked depth,"" that is likely a reflection on you, not the writing, the dialogue, the acting, the direction, or the story-line. The manner in which it focuses the subject matter and the existential struggle the film's premise produces, by confining the story to one neighborhood, practically one family's home, leaving the viewer to contemplate the big picture, was nothing short of visionary. I'm not a fan of ""slasher flicks"" in the least, but this is science fiction and not your average ""slasher flick,"" to suggest otherwise is simply ignorant. Now, as someone with a background in psychology, I could go on for days regarding the probable departures from ""reality"" statistically. However, the movie is squarely science fiction and in my humble opinion, the film accomplished what good science fiction should accomplish: It invites the viewer to examine themselves and their relationship with the rest of the world, if not the universe. It should make all of us a little uncomfortable, but not simply because of the violence and gore. Kudos to all those involved in making this film.","APR 18, 2014",10,Horror

For 12 hours, once a year, all crime is legal and people are given the opportunity to release their hatred and rage on anyone they can find. The cast isn't important to a film like this, it's all about the writers cynical message, that behind every smile is jealousy, behind every hand shake is anger, and trust has become a luxury that no one can afford. This Purge is all about the message that is being portrayed, but it has some major holes in the story. If all crime is legal for 12 hours, how come the only thing on peoples mind is murder? There weren't any **** or bank robberies, nor where there any acts of terrorism or lashing out at authority. It was all about the killing. Most of the Purge is fairly predictable and it is what you would expect it to be. The big surprise comes at the end, which was extremely powerful, and really gives people the opportunity to question the message the writers have portrayed throughout the film. The only notable performance is that of the stars, Ethan Hawke, who was terrific, in a role I really didn't see him fitting into.

The Purge,"The Purge has an original idea but fails to utilize its potential by making a standard home invasion thriller with cliched characters and a weak plot, which features some of the dumbest decisions made by the film's protagonists.

The Purge,"Imagine a world where crime is basically non-existent and almost everyone has a job and is doing well. Imagine this utopia is in the US in the year 2022. Thanks to a night held once a year called The Purge, this is all somehow possible. Any crime is legal for a night every year until morning comes. That is the basic setting for the movie. I‘ll cut to the chase. It’s supposed to be a horror sci-fi thriller but it fits none of the two supposed genres. It’s a short film (85 minutes) and the first roughly thirty consist of a wealthy Ethan Hawke and his family gearing up for the night. Other events complicate the family’s safety, and finally there are a few actually decent action scenes about an hour into the film and lead to a predictable yet tasteless ending. The main villain is a young fella who is the leader **** of college-aged kids taking part in The Purge (because c’mon, who doesn’t want to kill somebody?) and his acting job is creepily sinister and ends up giving you an overall solid job of being the bad guy. Otherwise, if you come expecting a scary, thrilling, and violent movie, you get none of the first two adjectives and a little bit of the third. I will have to say that the idea the movie presents is spectacular. It could be turned into an awesome futuristic film if taken seriously and turned into something serious (maybe down the lines of Looper, Cloud Atlas, etc.) so I’ll give writer-director James DeMonaco that.","JUL 14, 2014",5,Horror

Even though the idea was one of my favorite plot ideas in a while, I can’t get over the fact that it was set up to be this crazy and malicious crime spree night, but turned out to be like any other murder movie where the bad guy(s) come, the killing starts, and then the movie is over. In the movie world today, when I here a movie is coming up that has to do with a 12 hour period where all crime (including murder) is legal with no cops or hospitals, I expect it to be freaking awesome, wouldn’t you?","JUL 18, 2014",5,Horror

Though the execution was ultimately lacking, it was a nice setup. The Bad: It pretty much degenerates into the same cliche movie we have all seen a hundred times before. When the bad guys finally get in (come on, you knew they would!), it should be a suspenseful and chilling moment. Instead, it becomes a boring shoot 'em up. How many times can you see the ""good guy"" on the ground with a villain standing over them when suddenly, from somewhere off screen, shots ring out saving the day? It happens with mind numbing consistency in this film. Ethan Hawke's character was also not even remotely likeable and you find yourself rooting against him for most of the movie.","NOV 12, 2014",4,Horror

The Purge,"I feel almost cheated with this movie, honestly. It's hard to feel concerned for a character when you know absolutely nothing about them. The only characters I can remember by name (after finishing the movie just seconds ago) was Zoey Sandin. Apart from that I have no idea who anyone was or what their stories were. The antagonists seemed almost stereotypical in their Power Rangers Villain-esque portrayal, wanting to kill the ""homeless pig"" for the sake of a class war. This surprises me because in the event that this were a real event, it would more than likely be the lower class exhausting aggression on the upper class for obvious reasons. The antagonists, literally called in the subtitles: Freaks and Polite Leader, were completely bereft of any emotion and seemed to exhibit more of a Sociopathic tendency that you'd more likely see in a serial killer movie. There wasn't anything lovable about the characters on either side, there was no one that I could honestly relate to and consequentially care about. What really brought it all down hill though was the cultish behavior of the neighbors when they all gathered around to kill the family with a less than concerning prayer of sorts. I wasn't sure if I was watching a Quentin Tarantino movie, at which I would have at least expected a few comedic quips with very serious overarching themes or a movie based on the works of Steven King in which a supernatural occurrence is the source of all the craze, at which point I expected (but was not given) a brazen attempt to convey a psychological aspect of what I would do in that situation. Suffice to say, the movie fell flat in all aspects other than one thing that made me watch the movie in the first place: An original concept. This isn't something that's been done before and as stated at the beginning of my review, I feel cheated in how poorly it turned out.","NOV 4, 2013",4,Horror

Actually, for my opinion, the only thing that raises its popularity was its unbelievable plot which is making all crimes legal within the annual ""The Purge"" 12 hour period. The story tells us how a family managed to be secured and protected amidst of violent and chaotic people waiting outside their home that wanted to salvage and kill them. It is now up to them to destroy and kill those people before they killed them. So overall of my opinion. All that I can say was that this movie is still adequate for family watching.

The idea of the government allowing all crime to be legal for one night a year has the potential to make a great movie, but despite this interesting concept the movie falls short. Characters act moronic and the movie lacks any sense of fear. There is some pretty interesting political and social commentary here, but most of it gets drowned out by the overwhelming stupidity of the characters and their decisions. I get the overall theme of the movie, but the writers and director failed to capitalize on it. It's almost like they decided to make a movie with profound political commentary but just gave up and turned it into a generic home-invasion flick. I guess what I'm so disappointed with is the fact that the movie had the potential to be so much more. You can feel it all throughout this movie. Unfortunately I have to review this movie for what it is, not what it could have been. ""The Purge"" has some great ideas but ends up sinking in stupidity that really should not have been there.

Prostitution, drug dealers, corruption is done on a daily basis. Perverts, abusers would not wait until the government allows them to commit crimes. The purge system would only decrease a minimal amount of crime. Other then that imagine You try to kill your fellow worker, because he/she was not nice with on you **** imagine you fail, now you can spend the rest of the year feeling hatred toward that person. It is not really productive in a workplace. As I have wrote before criminals who live from crime, would not stop after a purge. Also why would they allow using fire-based weapons during a Purge? (There are some restriction but nothing for arson?) It would cost a lot to build up a city from the ashes right? The whole thing could use some more thinking to it.... Other than these, the characters were boring and the kid was the dumbest movie character I have seen in a long time. The kid actually wanted to save a stranger more than his own family...

The Purge,"This was quite possibly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It wasn't even so bad it was funny. It was just flat out aggravatingly terrible. The premise was interesting, but that's all I can really say good about this movie. The entire reason the events of the movie took place was because of the fact the father left access to the security system out in the open where anyone in the house could access it, and everyone in the family knew the code. It only gets worse from there, as the family had multiple chances to prevent things from escalating further, but made the dumbest decisions every time. One of the most unforgivable parts was when they were finally ready to solve the issue, and then the female characters who were otherwise fine with solving it suddenly broke down and said they shouldn't go through with it because it would make them terrible people. This is in spite of the fact they were being threatened with their lives by the very man who they were suddenly not so sure about handing over. And just then, they decided not to hand the guy over after all and instead face all the purgers outside instead. Not to mention finally in the end not all of the purgers were killed after the purge period ended, and considering all the damage the family did to them, those purgers will just be back again the next time but infinitely less merciful. And all because the family decided to show them mercy. They are quite possibly the dumbest family in existence and the plot was one of the most legitimately aggravating things I've ever experienced.

This certainly echoes the ultra-liberal gun culture in the United States and their cowboy side that they love so much and which they can't get rid of (hiiii-haaaa!). Unfortunately, it is surprisingly poorly exploited here, sloppy even, while this brilliant idea offered great possibilities. Because here we follow the Care Bears family (bad Americans certainly) who strive to kill no one or as little as possible... they still kill (when necessary) but not when they have excellent reasons to do so (you have to turn the other cheek, they must be Mormons in disguise, not possible otherwise...). This coincides, by the way, with a number of inconsistencies in the behavior of the Care Bears family which are added to those of the clumsy scenario which regularly suspends the suspension of disbelief with astonishing relentlessness. Furthermore, the rare situations that begin to benefit from this ludicrous purge are nipped in the bud almost immediately. It's a shame, because the Hawke/Headey couple is pleasant and likeable and the production is rather correct.","MAR 26, 2019",2,Horror

When you're hoping the ""heros"" are quickly killed by their tormentors that's a bad sign. As for the tormentors they come across as laughable at best.

The Purge,"That this movie isn't universally ridiculed is a sign of how bad things have gotten in America. The concept is ridiculous and the execution is very stupid: The two messages are: - too much violence is bad, so perhaps we should reduce violence. - The purge is already happening: The one percent is waging class warfare against the middle class and the poor, with their predatory lending schemes and with their continued sabotaging of the health care system. Many reviews fail to mention that with the Health Care System, a purge is already being waged against the very poor. Both the lousy concept and the poor execution are getting in the way of all that. Concept: The idea that a purge would work on any level is ridiculous: - revenge killing! - who's gonna prevent killing from being done after 7:01? And if I call it self-defense, who would challenge me? I can murder anyone, claiming that, which is what Zimmerman did, knowing full well no white jury would ever convict a white man. - too much pressure on EMT services the day after. - the risk that arson would destroy other homes than the targets is too great. - the enormous destruction of property. The execution: As a movie it's sooo full of plotholes, it's frankly beyond believe. 1. The BIGGEST and BADDEST security expert allows his 11 year old to access the security system and open the door for a total stranger. 2. The BIGGEST and BADDEST security expert, who's also very rich have no back up generator??? 3. The house apparently has no small battlement loopholes as in an opening or apertures in the wall, from which potential intruders can be shot. Like those bored rich kids. 4. the kids keep running off, makes no sense. 5. they keep splitting up. 6. daughter goes with the BF after BF tries to shoot her father. Very unlikely 7. Mother allows neighbor to walk after neighbor beeyatch tries to kill her kids, TWICE! Some very gentle kind soft natured mother will pump you full of lead if you even look at their kids funny. 8.

The Purge,"an interesting and logically unrealistic concept, sometimes the characters act stupidly and the film during scenes focuses on paranormal terror, with low lights, jumpscares and paranormal sightings when the same concept of the purge demands another type of approach, it is near the end What the film should have been like from the beginning happens, here the violence takes center stage, the action scenes are the ones that stand out the most in the entire film. Personally, this film has very untapped potential, it could be much more, but it can still entertain at times. Continuing, there is a kind of antagonist with ridiculous behavior, people instead of being murderers seem to be a kind of cultists that eliminates all seriousness in the film. (spoilers) in the movie they present a situation that caught my attention, the life of an innocent man or that of your family, it is clear that it is a fairly well-known but effective dilemma, I was thinking about why the fact of the apparently innocent man and beggar was African American, it occurred to me what if this is satire? some kind of criticism of American patriotism? It's not clear, they're just conclusions in my head and that's why I'm referring to wasted potential. It also occurred to me, what about the expenses after the purge?

The Purge,"I remember I first heard about this film in an ad before a YouTube video. It started with a voice-over said ""Don't skip this ad. You are about to see the trailer for the most disturbing movie of the year."" That was a bold statement, considering Evil Dead had already come out and The Conjuring was right around the corner. So naturally, I was curious and didn't skip the ad. One of the first things I noticed was that Ethan Hawke was in the film. I am a fan of Ethan Hawke, and since he was in Sinister a few months prior (one of the scariest films I've ever seen), I was even more curious. Then I noticed the interesting premise about all crime being legal for 24 hours, and as I sat and watched the trailer, I thought ""You know, this movie has a lot of potential if they do it right..."" Finally, June arrived and the release date came along, so I saw the film. I was surprised to see a lot of awful acting, bad directing, and a poorly written story. Any and all potential that this premise had was completely wasted. The filmmakers took the premise and did the laziest thing possible: they made it into a cheap slasher flick. The Purge tries to make you feel isolated/alone in a small area with people hunting you, much like how the first Alien movie did. But The Purge relies too much on jump-scares to scare you, which is not a good tactic for horror movies. Good horror has slow-building tension and a release, two things that The Purge has none of. The characters and the acting are similar in the sense that they're terrible and make you angry. The kids make HORRIBLE decisions, and even in some instances, endanger their own lives. For example, there is a scene where the daughter is upset with her parents, so she walks off, while the people are still invading their house. She risks her life just to act rebellious. Then the people invading the house aren't great either. They all seem to wear masks and act insane to seem creepy. This could have worked, but the moment someone fires a gun at them, they immediately stop acting this way, and they take cover and act like regular people, which gets rid of any creepiness of them possibly being mentally insane. My final rating for The Purge is a 3/10. I hoped that this movie would at least be worthy of a Redbox rent, but it isn't even worth that. Part of me feels that I went in expecting too much, and I probably did. However, in a way, with the marketing and the premise, I didn't expect too much out of it. If you say that your movie is the most disturbing movie of the year, then you better give me the most disturbing movie of the year.","APR 15, 2014",3,Horror

Ethan Hawke who plays James Sandin, the father and lead, does a good job of conveying himself as a morally confused figure; unsure whether to do what is 'right' or what is best for his family. However, you will find yourself frustrated with the acting from Max Burkholder, Adelaide Kane and Lena Heady, the respective son, daughter and wife of James Sandin. The son is meant to be the moral touchstone of the film, yet bland and uninteresting acting from Burkholder failed for this to be conveyed. There is not really a gel between the three, making moments between son and mother or mother and daughter somewhat awkward. Ultimately, we don't really care about their fate when they are thrown into potentially horrible situations. If you are looking for an in depth view into a futuristic world that examines the wider implications of a new and potentially possible regime, you won't find it here. If you are looking for something a bit simpler with occasional moments of excitement, by all means give this film a go.","DEC 5, 2013",3,Horror

Soul,"Soul is the latest new original Pixar Movie after a bad start with Onward after a series of sequels. How does Soul stand up? Really good! Now its not perfect, it does have issue such as the Joe and 22 Body switch with 22 in Joe's body and Joe in his cat's body has been done to death so many times and honestly it was hard for me to watch at that point because I was kinda uncomfortable watching stuff like 22 (as Joe) eating Pizza in a allyway or trying to be Joe, it just was super cringy. That and New York as a location has been done so many times. With That said, Soul is still a very powerful movie. The message about earth having something to offer everyone is relatable for anyone, the jazz elements make the film feel more grand, the ending where Joe gives up his chance to go back to earth to 22 was just wholesome and he got to go back to earth anyways, and it should a lot of relatable elements like wanting to impress our parents, and following our passions. Soul although as issues I addressed at the beginning of this review, is still a very strong, emotional film. Does it stand against the OG Pixar films? No but its a very good film and I recommend it.","FEB 7, 2021",7,Family

Soul,"Some time around the late 2000s, Pixar Animation Studios ceased to be the ""can't do no wrong"" auteurs that produced thought-provoking hits after hits. Somewhere along the line, it lost its soul and was reduced to being just another movie studio. And so, the world watched as we awaited the day when Pixar returns to form. Perhaps it's due to this vigilance that imbues in us an extra layer of stringency in our criticisms. Ironically, the protagonist of Soul, Joe Gardner (Jamie Foxx), is very much like Pixar studios. He recognizes the craft, he knows it like the back of his hand, but he doesn't really understand the inner beauty of the music, the soul of jazz that embraces someone with the joys of life. He's too caught up in the technicality of the craft, too focused on textbook methods that make jazz function properly. That's what Pixar movies have been for the past decade, and even now in 2020, it's my opinion that Pixar hasn't returned to its peak yet. That cat comedy schtick, man, it really took away from what could've been the movie of my dreams, the one that I envisioned when I first watched the teaser to the film and what potential it could have as a story. But instead, we get fairly generic comedy routines stagnating the middle parts of the film instead of focusing on Joe and 22 (Tina Fey)'s enjoyment of everyday life. I wouldn't mind watching an entire arc of that stuff. Act 2 of the film just wasn't as potent as it should be due to its reliance on tired comedy routines when it could've just been an entire slice-of-life sequence celebrating the mundanities of ""regular ol' living."" But then comes Act 3, the final part of our tale, when Joe realizes what he has missed out or possibly forgotten in life, those very simple joys we take for granted: a new haircut, company with your dad, enjoying the morning breeze on a bike, sunrise, fireworks… and of course, the joy of opening a student's eyes to the wonders of life. You start to see during the final parts of the film what it should've been all along. You start to see what it could've been. And if that's not tragic enough, I didn't really like the final scene either. I feel like a stronger ending would've been Joe being led to his teaching career again, bookending the story with where he started as he learns to appreciate the simple things. As it is, the movie just feels unfinished, like an unpolished draft. To be clear, I think that 70% of the movie was well done. If you just cut out that 30% of comedy filler and focused more on building the atmosphere as Joe and 22 ride through the joys (and perhaps even the pains) of life, that would've been a stronger story. As it is, it's just another animated movie.","MAR 26, 2021",7,Family

Soul,"Soul, beyond most films and animations made from the past to the present, deals with the meaning of life. This is not enough, and the main art of this animation is to make people think about life and how it is. Extremely strong animate, unique soundtrack, and excellent directing and editing are so accurate that the viewer does not notice them, and this is exactly what the artist's mission in film and animation is. To add value to a work of art without feeling its presence. The right characterization of Joe Gardner, a very strong script and a tremendous impact after watching the animation, is what makes you think and think about your life for a long time after it is over. Also, the type of display of pre- and post-mortem events for a child who is not familiar with these phenomena, is done beautifully and creates the best definition and mentality for them. Ultimately, this animation was not made for a specific age group, nor for a specific way of thinking, and everyone will feel deep pleasure in watching it.

All the while the creators are raking in the money for the movie while simultaneously getting people pumped for the new TV show. As for the movie itself it's not that bad, it may only please the younger Star Wars fans, but older fans can get into it if they keep an open mind. It's basically just one battle scene after another with a simple plot behind it, and even adds some lightsaber duels and some touches of humor here and there, and does a good job of introducing a few of the new characters that you will be seeing in the TV show.

Soul,"Soul is Pixar’s attempt to add humor to death under ironic circumstance. While playing fast and loose with the concept of birth, death and the afterlife, it often succeeds, but misses its opportunity to give life to itself with a truly worthy theme. Instead, Soul suggests that humans with a true purpose in life abandon their excellence in favor of acceptance and the world’s view of carpe diem. In short, it’s an attack on introverts and artists. While a somewhat entertaining film there are a dozen messages that are not especially positive for young viewers. As a piece of pure fiction, however, it delivers the typical feast of Pixar humor and humanity.","JAN 29, 2021",5,Family

Star Wars: The Clone Wars,"What a marvelous idea, to make a film made of several episodes of the tv-show with the same name. George Lucas is full of surprises. ""Jar Jar is the key to all this"". The show starts in a very fast way with tonne of action and blasters coming from every direction. The plot is quickly introduced and we follow Anakin and Obi-Wan through the struggles of the war. My first impression is the cinematography, which is so smooth and well combined with the events that happen throughout the whole movie. The action is actually pretty good. It got some moments of intensity and entertainment and it does deliver. But this is only one part of it. Later on the plot becomes a bit ""meh""; it started to lack entertainment from a long-term perspective. It's no surprise why, it's the structure of the film that's the most crucial. Having three or four episodes of the tv-show with the same name combined into one film comes with some disadvantages. The tempo keeps going up and down over and over, and the plot keeps getting messier and messier. It shouldn't have been a movie, not by a long shot! The plot isn't as good as it could have been, but as a tv-show, it would have worked excellent! The negative aspects doesn't stop there; because the basics are very non-flawless. The characters are very well visualized but some of them does make very Illogical decisions, that they never would have done in the prequels. This is just for a few characters but it's so non-admirable to the source material. The main characters are good when it comes to interaction, but there are a lot of dry moments that could have been better. This includes the dialogs, which can be very dry, fact-based and very Lucas-alike (characters that show their emotions and tell what they think). That's a big flaw right there, we don't need to! We are human beings that can relate to characters through just a brief look at them. There are a few positive aspects with this show, and except for what just was mentioned; are the a lot of connections with the prequels, both details and twists to those films. The plot is as mentioned very messy, but it can still be entertaining with a good villain and a somewhat okay tempo of action. But the flaws are very big, and that includes the horrible CGI. This is coming from a 2008-movie where CGI is supposed to be well-developed. Even the early days were better. Still, some details like ships are still somewhat okay to look at, but the rest can be so horrible that it's barely watchable. The last aspect that really is bad is the editing, especially when it comes to action-sequences where frames can be disorientated and very horrible done in a very flawed way. There are very few long and constant shots and it therefor can feel too CGI-ish and not real. ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" is one of the most flawed movies I've seen. But personally; do I still find it somewhat okay even though I've already forgotten mostly of the plot. Personal rating: 60/100 Critical rating: 36/100","OCT 31, 2015",6,Family
Soul,"A huge step forward for Disney who continues to extend the cultural variety and diversity of its characters. This time we follow an old black man whose passion is jazz. Everything is far from being perfect in his daily life, especially the day he comes to die by accident. The story really begins at this point. I think this is truly ingenious and even thought it was going to be a far more interesting movie than I expected. Following a man in his fifties is awesome. Following a man struggling with life but who realizes that it could be worse is great. Following a man who dies by being not enough focus in the streets is promising. Following a man trying to make a living from music is profound. Soundtrack is as great as the animation. Pace in general is a bit weird with two serious slow and sleepy parts. Scenario was awesome at some point but ends up getting all messed up... The rest of the story we follow Joe Gardner's soul in heaven who obviously wants to come back to Earth as soon as possible. He comes up to encounter some disruptive elements allowing the movie to take a huge funny yet unnecessary journey to make the kids laugh because in overall this movie is really hard to understand for them. For example, creatures living in heaven are just human concept ideas and are wierdly represented. Without speaking about a particular religion this movie however question their existence and especially asks the question of life after death (and life before life). The ending is what made me lower the score so much. You don't die from nothing. Dying by accident doesn't make your death funnier, easier for your friends and family, less unexpected or even reversible. The major flaw of this movie is that it sweetens the reality of life too much. What would you have thought if Bambi's mother or Simba's father had woken up as if nothing had happened after being mortally wounded? Or the queen in 'White Snow'? Or Synndrome in 'The Incredibles'? 'Soul', in its core-story, is way too close to reality to allow itself to take death lightly. The fact it came out during COVID should have make the directors think more about it. If you want to sell dreams, sell real dreams, if you want to get closer to daily life, do it. But don't get piteously stuck in between. There were some truly attractive points in 'Soul' but when you consider it as a whole you easily realize it is falling into pieces.","JAN 6, 2021",6,Family

Soul,"When I used to be a screenwriter type -- I'd sometimes write a story that was full of great ideas and such -- but at the end of the story it didn't nail the landing. For days I'd scratch my head and try to make parts of the story more spectacular. Which this film does to... no effect. Except that it makes matters worse. What I would then do is step back from MY story and act like it was written by someone else. What I would then do is go thru the 'rule book' (best practices of all great movies) and -- VOILA -- I'd discover broken rules. Everywhere. Listen. I'm not talking about formula. I hate formula too. I'm talking about best practices. Do tables work best with four legs? Yup. So did Soul include tables with four legs? Or did they get caught up in/very distracted by their 'wonderful' story and forget these best practices? That's a big YUP. The most appalling practice they violated was, ""Who's story is this?"" Like it or not, Pixar, every great story has one lead that the story belongs to. Did the Good Witch take over the story from Dorothy? Nope. Did Leia take over Luke's story? Nope. Did Buffalo Bob take over Starling's story? NOPE. So why does SOUL think 22's story is more interesting than Joe's? To the (painful) degree that 22 inserts herself inside of Joe? This is not a transgender story. It was a story about a black man and jazz and then SOUL throws that in the dumpster. So when this movie takes a victory lap for featuring a first black protagonist, think again. The morons are blissfully unaware that they got bored of that story and thought whitey ping pong ball Tina Fey was a better idea. Like I said, PAINFUL. Tina Fey's role was supposed to be 'the best friend'. That's the 'best practice'. The entity that helps Joe on his journey. SHE should have become the cat, not Joe. The other major misstep in this piece is what I call WRITERS WRITING ABOUT WRITING. Instead of telling a story for all of us -- they're telling their story. The obvious violation of this is when a story is about a writer writing a screenplay that gets produced and his girl decides to marry him because ""you're such a great writer!"" In SOUL Writers Writing About Writing is much better hidden. But it's there. You see the audience was pitched this story about a jazz musician. So what we wanted to see was a musician who goes 'into the zone' and makes us feel all warm and jazzy. Jazz, in this story, is really about being a Disney animator. Spending morning noon and night rendering crap on computers. This was hinted at in the scene where the stock broker is given a soul. Remember what he did the moment that happened? He pushed his PC and monitor off his desk and ran out of the room gleeful to be alive. In other words: ""Don't be a tool like me and sit in front of a computer all day. Go outside, in the sunshine, watch a leaf fall, and enjoy a slice of pizza!!!!"" This 'universal truth' is more an accidental recommendation of the story instead of an inspired goal. And really -- this viewer would have rather watched a musician find JAZZ and by doing so somehow unlock the secret of the universe. And I don't love jazz that much, mind you. It's just that -- -- yet another best practice is called 'If you put a gun on the stage -- use it."" The gun, in SOUL, is jazz. Which they trashed for a slice of pizza. This movie is being rated better than it should because black lives matter. But the cynical way this film blackspoited Joe to tell Tina's story is APPALLING. 5 stars is being generous. I'm giving this film a 5 but frankly it's not worth recommending or seeing again.","FEB 8, 2021",5,Family

""Soul"" touches upon complicated philosophical issues (the issues of life and death, as well as the search for purpose and meaning of one's own existence), which, I felt like, are too difficult not only for children who will probably fall asleep in the cinema, but also for the authors themselves, who seemed to be confused, trying to understand what they want to tell the audience in the end. The answers and solutions to the (insoluble) existential questions offered by ""Soul"" seem to me somewhat unsatisfactory. Digging deeper than commercial animation filmmakers usually do, Pixar's scriptwriters have reached a level where any attempt to answer a question clearly and unequivocally, will look naive. In ""Soul"" there is A LOT of things that can get more and more confusing the more you think about logic of the world created by Pixar, but it gets even more embarassing when you realise what it lacks: for example, themes of love and loneliness, past which the storyline deftly maneuvers. It's difficult for me to agree with the formula ""love of life"" = ""the ability to enjoy little things and what we call ""routine"""" (A slice of pizza? Riding a bike?) = ""happy life."" I think this formula obviously lacks at least love, friendship and a sense of belonging to something greater than one's self. It's possible (and sometimes even useful) to speak simply about such complex things with adults and children, but to claim to be true in this case means to impose a point of view and even show a share of ignorance, leveling thousands of years of the history of the development of existential philosophy. However, it's still a unique and enjoyable animated film that was fun for me to watch. I think it is better to stay at this level of perception and not try to unravel the tangle, which neither Nietzsche, nor Sartre, nor Kierkegaard, nor the authors of ""Soul"" managed to do successfully.","DEC 30, 2020",6,Family

Star Wars: The Clone Wars,"It's boring. While the series had some silly moments, these at least gave you some laughs. The series is also slower, not slow but slow, it takes moments to get the characters to talk and evolve. There is none of that here and what little there is doesn't feel natural at all. Asooka and Anakin interact as if they have known each other for a long time with a very trusting apprentice-master relationship, but in context they have only met a few hours ago. Furthermore, all the dialogue that in the series is interesting and takes more time, here, they change it for constant fights and they become boring. I wasn't expecting something like an episode of the saga acted out in real life, but I was expecting something more than just one extremely long episode with fights. It is literally that, an episode to which they added more fights to lengthen its duration from 1-2 episodes to a movie. 04/10","NOV 18, 2015",4,Family
Soul,"First of all nice idea but just that, there is nothing more, even not deep emotional moments. just a nice idea and they just wanned to put it in your mind ok enjoy of every single minutes of your pathetic life even walking what next. there was no creativity in **** comparison to up or inside out it's disappoiting.","JAN 3, 2021",5,Family
Soul,"Amazing visuals, snappy dialogue, interesting characters, lacking story, deplorable protagonist, and an ending that doesn't provide closure. I'd say I barely enjoyed watching it and will probably not see it another time. This movie honestly feels like it's trying to imitate Pixar's Inside Out, but does so with disingenuous material and does it poorly. We follow our main guy Joe along his life being obsessed with music and finally getting the gig he wants only to fall into a sewer and die. From there we get to see the Great Beyond and the Great Before; terms that become problematic when talking about any actual afterlife that the movie makes neatly side step by saying that's all in the beyond. Joe is able to avoid the Beyond (only to put a time limit on his actions and to trick him into thinking he's special) and escapes to the Before, where he proceeds to get back to his body even at the cost of stealing other's lives. Joe constantly shows he's selfish and doesn't care about others and only changes after he destroys a life and only through Deus Machina fixes it. Combined with a lot of psych nonsense rhetoric, anti-christian hints, and naive view of life makes this movie feel like a way of tricking the next generation the way Disney did the previous: feelings are all that matter.","DEC 25, 2020",4,Family

Soul,"Foxx and Fey do a wonderful job with natural chemistry and that is really the only good I have to say about it. The plot was as predictable as the trailer made it out to be and that I felt took away a lot from it overall. And the music didn't leave a lasting impression as other Disney films do. Also shockingly is that for a movie that is less than 90 minutes, It really dragged at times and hit far too many cliches over the course of the film.","DEC 25, 2020",3,Family

Star Wars: The Clone Wars,"Originally intended to be a series of episodes for the eventual TV show, The Clone Wars ultimately was a poor decision to create as a movie. It introduces characters that will play well down the road, but this movie is disjointed and lacks a cohesive vision for how to be satisfying in a cinematic sense. See this movie if you want the origin story for Asokha Tano, Anakin's bratty padawan who slowly wins you over through several seasons of the strange but fun CGI animated series.","DEC 15, 2017",3,Family
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,"""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" ultimately cannot bring enough to match itself with its live-action franchise, and its story lacks much of the wit put into their world. With its constant usage of action, without finess, the film suffers to be nothing more than a movie made to make a few bucks. Though kids will be fine with it, older kids and adults will probably want to spend their money on other movies out there.","JUL 25, 2013",3,Family
Soul,"High-concept, yet uninteresting to watch. The story in the ""real world"" of the movie was wonderful to look at and experience, but most of the film takes place in a nonsense color-scape. I also found it borderline unbelievable that when the Soul of a white woman took over the body of a black man, she solved all of his problems in one day. It felt like it went against any stronger message the film tried to portray.","DEC 16, 2023",2,Family

Star Wars: The Clone Wars,"This was utterly painful to sit through. Don't get me wrong I LOVE STAR WARS, but this isn't the Star Wars that we loved back in our childhoods. Where did all this go wrong? My guess is that George Lucas wanted to extend the lifespan of Star Wars merchandising by making a new Star Wars movie made up of the first 3 or 4 episodes The Clone Wars TV series, only to expand on the merchandising when the series came out. This is not Star Wars. This is Star Wars: The Bored Wars. The battles are not exciting or engaging; they are the most formulaic thing in the film, and there is nothing much to add aside from how poorly edited this movie really was. Hell, the episodes, if they were kept in their original forms, would probably be just as bad as before even without the clumsy sandwiching they used to put them together in one under-produced film.","OCT 25, 2012",2,Family

Believe me when I say it hammers in this poorly executed message about saving the environment, which to be fair is a good moral, but they handled it horribly. It’s rubbish. The Bad Guy might as well have his “How Bad Can I Possibly Be” In this Movie because that’s his purpose. This movie has a cast of bland and uninteresting characters animated horribly just like how Dexter Scaretetive and that Horrific THING moved around in Foodfight. I know I was rough to this movie. But the movie made every artic Dance personal so I might as well dance along with Lockwood, Drack and Gene and do The MojiPop in this trainwreck you need skill to make. Do not watch this movie.

Norm of the North,"I heard this film was terrible but I didn't expect it to be that bad. the movie at first was just generic bad but as the film went on, I got a sick feeling in my stomach. The sickness wasn't from any gross-out humor or something vile and vulgar the characters were doing but at the thought that this film shows what utter contempt Hollywood has for the movie-going audience and your children. I started to hate this film but by the end this film disgusted me in a way I never felt before. This is perhaps one of the worst movies I have ever seen somehow make it to the silver screen and get some budget and shows that they think we are a bunch of idiots that will lap up whatever they crank out, but boy are they wrong with me. This film is so bad it makes me respect Jack and Jill, perhaps one of the worst big budget films ever made and shows similar contempt for its audience but this film goes one step farther by targeting children.
