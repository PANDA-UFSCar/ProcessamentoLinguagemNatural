Incredible action scenes that will not leave anyone indifferent with a perfect soundtrack for each scene, incredible sound effects and super epic and exciting fights.

John Wick,Great action fest until the Hotel part and then the story falls off the grounded cliff into flights of silly fantasy. I like half of this movie so 5/10 hey?

John Wick,"Why it rocks: The story is clear, it isn’t boring, and it takes a break from the action when it wants to. Now the action itself is stunning. Very thrilling and exciting, absolutely jaw dropping and memorable. John Wick himself is a very committed person, and he stays that way.","APR 9, 2023",10,Crime
John Wick,"Very stylish film with good close combat action sequences (and some vehicle action). Villain is made to be fairly realistic and mortal, more so than John Wick, which is a nice change as these types of films often make the villains seem unrealistically bad. There's subtle dark humor mixed in throughout the film. Negatives, biggest is the large contrast of dialogue volume to music and sound effects, at least on a standard TV (may be better with an external sound system). You will need the remote, trust me. You also just have to accept it's unrealistic like many action films with the main character seeming to be invincible (though constantly getting beat up and seeming on the verge of death). The premise is borderline absurd though it's likely intentional, that he takes down a massive NYC crime mob all on his own because the son of the mob leader killed his dog and stole his car (why is explained as the film goes on, trying to avoid spoilers here). Could use more variety in the action, most of it is indoor gun shootouts, him versus 50 mob people several times (how big is this mob anyway? law enforcement has really failed if they've allowed something this big to develop). His dialogue is intentionally minimal but when he does speak, sometimes it comes off a bit corny and he has one mood / demeanor the entire film with a few exceptions (again, that likely isn't an oversight but what they wanted). Soundtrack is okay, may have been better without some of the alt-rock songs, not sure.","JUN 5, 2021",7,Crime
John Wick,"I can accept the fact that John Wick has supernaturally fast reflexes and a crack aim, but the CQQ fighting didn't seem plausible. Lots of beating up henchmen twice his size; he got away with it in the Matrix as it wasn't reality. Here? Not so much. 100's died in a bitter revenge tale because of a dog. He must have really loved that dog for the 5 minutes he had it.","MAR 5, 2023",7,Crime
John Wick,"After watching this movie I don't really know, where all the hype around the news parts comes from. It's an alright action movie with greatly executed fight scenes and setpieces, yet the story and (under-)world is absolutely boring to me. John frequently causes massacres depopulating entire city-blocks and it's mostly nodded off with a witty one-liner, that's fine one or two times, but it's seen multiple times throughout the entire movie. Still better than any Fast, Furious, or otherwise stathamy movie these days and Keanu Reeves definitely carries the entire thing.","JAN 20, 2021",7,Crime
John Wick,"I'm tired of the same action films, but I really liked this one. I'm not sure if it's because the director knows that this is an action movie and doesn't aim higher so you don't fall short of expectations. A simple, but effective story for the main character, good fights and stunts, good characters and an opened door for a sequel.","NOV 1, 2021",8,Crime

John Wick,"I normally don't make reviews for movies but this movie was so good I had to make an exception. This movie is not just your typical generic action movie where your main character is an assassin given a task by someone, instead it's about a retired assassin that must go back to his old life after travesty strikes him. The pacing is surprisingly brilliant as it starts you off with John Wick injured and you don't understand how he got there, but it's abundantly clear at that point he's not a super solider who can withstand everything, he's still a human at the end of the day and that's what makes you care about him throughout the entire movie since you worry and fear for his life when there are DOZENS of bad guys in this film. Speaking of the bad guys, these main villains are technically noobs but the reason you'll start to care about them is that they commit a horrible act to the main character of all people and that in return helps you start to root for John to take down the bad guys and when he does, I'm glad it's a ""kill him, get out of there"", there's really no reason to delay their deaths and I'm glad the directors understood that. Speaking of killing, the gun fighting and techniques Keanu Reeves uses to take down his opponents are surprisingly good and are more focused and smart and you can really feel it with how the camera moves. The characters are surprisingly memorable with each of their individual actions and motivations and helps out in more variety in the film. Now that being said, it's all not happy news with how this movie reuses plenty of enemies with no stronger ones later on and it does drag down the experience when you have to watch John kill basically the same leveled enemies over and over again. In the end though, this film is amazing and is certainly a film I'd love to re-watch in the distant future with how good it is and I can't wait to see what the sequels have in store.","JAN 25, 2023",10,Crime
John Wick,"Who would've thought a movie about someone taking revenge for their dog, would lead to one of the best action franchises of all time? Rewatching the first one after all this time, John Wick isn't as badass here as he is in later entries. He survives a lot because the antagonist don't simply kill him or because his friend saves him. It also ends weirdly with a one on one fight with an old man. Nevertheless, it is still a terrific action movie with memorable action sequences such as the house and the club shoot-out. Keanu was also a great casting choice! This should be a template for how to make a great action movie!","MAY 26, 2023",8,Crime

John Wick,"John Wick, a story about a killer who wanted to get involved, but as one of the villains said, “is it fate or chance” that their paths crossed again, the story of the place would say nothing special, there is some backstory, the first 10 minutes, and that’s it It was enough, or... it became a pity, in general, I felt John’s pain, and I understand him. Some guy ruined everything, here the film itself begins, an action shootout, then we are introduced to some characters, friends (even a killer can have friends), acquaintances. Then there was a moment when one character acted very stupidly, and John himself said it, and then in 3 in my film, he himself commits this stupidity, it’s funny. The film is an action thriller, and this is not bad, the scenes are at their best and everything is real, but from time to time we remind you that Wick is also a human being, and gets injured, and there are a couple of scenes where he is almost killed, if not for the circumstances. The theme of family also creeps in a little, because losing everything because of a mistake by a relative is really bad, but doing nothing is also not an option, your conscience will torment you, and here you can understand the main villain. Bottom line: A good action movie of category B, what I realized after watching the film is that the revenge of a dish that is served cold, the animals are innocent.","JUL 29, 2023",8,Crime

John Wick,"John Wick is something special. It takes as much time setting up elaborate action sequences as it does the world with which it all takes place in. And what a world it is. It reminds me of Millers Crossing and it is cooler than any other recent attempt at noir. We are shown a criminal underworld where, if you are connected, many powerful people know who you are and show you respect. John Wick was connected but he got out. He is the rare killer who has found peace, and he is grateful for that peace. Some young kids steal that from him and he does what he does best, he wages a one man war against the Russian Mafia. It might sound like the film takes quite a leap but it all makes sense. The motives of John and the people who get in the way of his bullets are all very clear, even if it does come across as rather simple. That's the plot at it's most basic. Then there's the action. The film is directed by Reeve's stuntman from The Matrix, so this guy knows action. There are sequences that flow so smoothly it puts other action films and their quick cuts to shame. Keaunu moves so fluidly throughout the film and comes across as such a natural that the only disappointment is that we have not seen him like this before. Along the way are plenty of character actors, fans of The Matrix and The Wire will recognize a few people then there are more obvious ones like Ian McShane and Willem Dafoe. Everyone seems to be having a good time. That is another plus for this movie. It get's dark at times but overall it is quite fun, not very chipper, but fun. I cannot recommend this movie enough. I believe it is a must see for action fans and for anyone looking for something a bit different from the usual fare :)","MAY 21, 2023",9,Crime

If you're asking me if John Wick is a good quality movie, the answer is more of a ""meh, not really... but it's not bad."" The acting is almost non-existent (seemingly by design to fit Keanu Reeves' style), the plot is about as generic as they come, and the ending is laughable.

There is only one thinkable reaction to this - murder Theon, his Russian mafia boss father, and everyone that gets in the way. Luckily, there is this hotel owned by Odin and managed by leutenant Daniels from Wire that houses all the assassins in the world and sees that they don't assassinate themselves in the hotel. Except they do. Then there is this chick. Well, better not to think about it much, it's as braindead as all the corpses the thin plot manages to manufacture on the way. At least the action is slick and well choreographed, no cheap shakycam like Bourne, and there is satisfying number of nice black cars, leather and quality booze - yes, sir, Blanton's is a fine bourbon, so points for that!","JUN 22, 2019",5,Crime

Unlike Rambo/Die Hard/The Raid/Dredd or any other worthwhile action flick, John Wick has no motivation and its sense of humor is merely passable. It sports a completely unnecessary 20 minute code on the end that just rehashes the 20 minutes that came before that.

John Wick,"A Clear Polished Job. John Wick Stahelski's action trilogy is every fan boy's wet dream. He clearly ought to be one of them to justify and glorify the characters like such on screen. His old productive textbook methods are testament to why it works and we nod so effervescently in his every possible scenario even though it raises questions every now and then. This people pleasing entertainment has one and only one reason to communicate it so thoroughly and its tendency to lean towards the mythological aspect of the characters. Despite of being dipped into a pragmatic mafia world, it makes sure that there is one key to every lock, one moon and one sun that shines over these surprisingly loyal and professional businessmen. On that note, the amiability of it to grasp that theme and beam us back to our childhood days, Stahelski is successful in his work. In fact, personally, I feel the lead to be eerily similar to the comic character He-Man. He too has a pet animal and is incredibly feared by his enemies, something that Stahelski has got it right on the mark. The build up of his presence on a room or even a mention of his that makes others writhe on the spot, is so precious for this storytelling to move forward, that Stahelski has made its priority and with Reaves- a smart casting choice since he already has such a reputation- on the realm, he can sleep peacefully. And yes, it is for every man himself, Reeves never turns off the switch, he oozes power, chic panache and flamboyancy in his body language to own the surrounding, the car, the gun and the hype. The entire movie hangs on a single moment, that it is built towards, a moment where finally Reeves accepts his fate and claims the title that everyone has been giving him- something that you would encounter in a mythology- and that of course because of brilliant execution is one of the best shot scene. Stahelski coming from a stunt department, the action leaves you in an awe of it, from imputing humor and bedazzling moments in this gore visual galore of his, the camera work is purely stupendous. And this is probably the only reason why it aches you to encounter a disappointing final act, since the choreography is neither clean nor is it shot perfectly enough to give even a vague idea to map around one's mind. The supporting characters are balanced and well bred, with antics that are derived from their equations, Dafoe, Palicki and Nyqvist stands out alone for their lethal-ness. Stahelski's theme resonates more like Goddard- the creator of Marvel's Daredevil- than it does with Wachowski Brothers which is surprising since he came from that background. Another appealing aspect of it is the cleanliness, its huge neat production set and props that makes you want to pick up the gun and shoot out wild. John Wick is not pushing any boundary in cinematic world, it respects and accepts its place and delivers the best knockout there is.","JAN 27, 2019",5,Crime
John Wick,"John Wick is Carl Rinsch's second attempt at making a movie (again with Reeves) after making the pile of **** 47Ronin. This movie is, like his last attempt, a bunch of cliche film tropes with barely any original shots, plot ideas, characters or dialogue. The film is well produced having substantial advertising and even a videogame tie in but the actual movie shows naivety in it's inability to take risks or show originality. From the start the characters and their motivations are dis-interesting and bland, we're introduced to several characters like they're important, only to have them die seconds later or get 3 minutes of screentime . With nothing at stake the events that progress the plot have no impact or hold any importance to the viewer, meanwhile the characters in the scenes react weirdly and unrealistically to whats happening, making everyone appear heavily autistic or simply insane. Weird editing seemingly cuts all connecting shots in the film leaving it disjointed and awkward, there's no sense of immersion because the movie only tells and never shows to the point of frustration. John just does **** off screen, critical interactions between characters are just imposed instead of created. Simply put this movie is **** boring, it's not a well made B movie, it's a poorly made B movie with an A movie budget. John Wick is a real piece of **** from the extremely dated 90s emo soundtrack ft Marilyn Manson constantly to the tediously cliche scenes, awkward writing, and 1 dimensional characters the movie really comes across as a script written and directed by a child.

John Wick,my buddy recommended this movie. OMFG! good thing I did not spend money on this POS. I understand they were going for that samurai movie thing but this movie just doesnt do it for me. KR is a seriously annoying and overrated actor. he mumbles and stumbles his way through this movie. The goons are bargain basement and pretty much fail to check corners and walk into his line of fire. Russian mob types are way overused and abused at this point. I'll admit that I watched this on youtube and didnt finish it. Movie was just a waste of time. I could care less about the dog.,"MAY 10, 2015",1,Crime
John Wick,"""John Wick"" is another in a long line of movies about a character, who, like Rambo, like Jason Bourne, like the Man With No Name, is the world's toughest tough guy or the world's most dangerous hired gun. If comic book heroes excite you, then by all means watch ""John Wick"". If the topic of actual real-life organized crime killers interests you then what you should see is one of the documentaries about Richard ""The Iceman"" Kuklinski, who is reputed to have killed dozens, if not hundreds, by way of the Gambino's DeMeo crew. I give this film a 3 because if a character is going to take out an entire platoon of assassins he or she better be wearing spandex -- that or having flashbacks about Master Po.","APR 7, 2017",3,Crime

They killed his puppy! Think for micro second.. John Wick probably did worse than that before he fell in love and left the crime world in order to live the good life from all of his ill begotten riches. Coupled with absolutely no other true character development and for what of that there is, it takes a back seat to the non stop MATRIX LIKE hand to hand battle sequences that make up 95% of the film. Isn't that nice of Hollywood to develop a series of films where Keanu Reeves doesn't have to act and involves almost identical battle sequences using his skillset that he had previously learned for The Matrix trilogy.. hmmmm things that make you go hmmmm.... at least the matrix had an interesting and way more complex storyline to frame the action sequences in it.

Sitting through so many cringe-worthy moments and cliches, I just can't for the life of me understand how human memory can be so dull, people can see these exact same scenes we've all seen for the past 20 years and think - 'this is groundbreaking'. Wick really reminded me of Ben Stiller's Scorcher in 'Tropic Thunder' (""The man who made a difference 5 times before is about to make a difference again, but this time it's different"" ).

This one was easily among the top 5 worst ones on my list. It is guaranteed plot-less, and focuses mainly on extreme violence. Even in its violent scenes it is merely silly. Why would a trained assassin who already killed 50 people miss his main target? Not very likely. Yes, the choreography of the fight scenes is nice, but Hong Kong movies have done this even better about 2-3 decades ago. It is sad to see good actors such as Willem Dafoe languish in such a sub-par mess. What is the target audience for it? 17-year old video-game playing nerds with an IQ of a blender.

I've exected something simple yet smart (like Dredd) but what i've got... 1) The plot: old killer is in retirement, and some stupid spoiled kid kills his dog, so he goes on and kill spoiled kid, his father and every other dude on the way. It's not an oversimpliifcation, it's the actual plot. 2) The characters: John Wick is well...stylish, brutal, silent, but generic and boring. His the best killer ever and everyone - i've mean cop, receptionist, car repair owner, bartender, neighbours in the hotel - knows best killer in the face, by his name, knows his wife and about his retirement. Other guys just there. Russian godfather at least have SOME charisma, but it's as good as it gets. 3) The action: plain boring. There is no good choreography, no clever moves, no planing, nothing worth watching. Best killer, famous for performing impossible jobs acts as lazy hitman player - just shoot everyone on sight. 4) The russians (yep, i'm russian myself): Come on guys. Russian bad guys are cool, but at least make them not absurd. Baba Yaga (which was translated as Boogeyman) is actually charismatic clever very old lady (basically a witch), acts as both bad and good character in slavic folklore. Songs are out of place, accent is bad, phrases are wrong. (please note what is not about ""as a russian i was insulted""; it's about overall quality and lazy work done with source material. It's really not that hard to do right.) 5) The connection: John Wick and villains are so plain and boring what you just do not care. You don't want to see spoiled kid dead (ask Game of Thrones fans about it), you don't want to see his father dead, you don't feel for John and his ""friends"". 6) The lore: for some reason killers have their own awesome hotel, use gold coins as currency (i've just assume it was old Russian Empire golden rubles - it's makes it even more absurd), everyone knows each other by name and in the face - yep, it's include the police. Awesome. In the end it's just plain boring and bad movie without plot. 3/10","JAN 18, 2015",3,Crime

This film somehow made me feel equally indifferent to the villainous puppy-killer and the vengeance seeking protagonist. How the f*%k did they pull that off? Jeez!

John Wick,"There is no plot. There is no story. There is a lot of action but it's directed at people in a conflated way that attempts to combine the death of the protagonists wife by cancer with the killing of his dog, which were two separate events that have very little to do with each other. Again although the killing of his dog was brutal, the protagonist wrongly conflates the two issues together. There is no background on his character at all which makes me wonder if there was a comic book I was supposed to read beforehand. There is plenty of death and action scenes that serve no point at all but then to just be brutal. The movie draws regular allusions to Keanu Reeves previous movies like ""The Matrix"" , ""Matrix Reloaded"", and ""Matrix Revolutions"" with a keymaker type character (was it even the same actor?) and the ending scene being in the rain between him and one person colliding to name a couple. However this movie is nothing like what it alludes to at all. Not in action or in plot substance. Now for some speculation. This movie was so bad, I almost wonder if the entire thing was thought up by Eva Longoria (no joke that's one of the producers) to try and make men with dogs seem intimidating. There is trend going around where many single men adopt dogs instead of girlfriends so it really makes you wonder. This should give you an idea of the possibly terrible hipster thinking behind this movie. 1 out of 10. Get laid again instead of adopting dogs to fill your void, and don't conflate issues.","JUN 12, 2015",1,Crime

It's like a shooter video game with silly cut-scenes; except you're stuck watching the cut-scenes. This is like a movie based on a crummy videogame, which was based on a B movie. This isn't like watching 1995 Mortal Kombat ""so bad it's good"", it's like watching an Uwe Bol film, **** bad. An action movie without a proper plot is like a shinny sports car without an engine. I never watch a film without scrutinizing the people involved. I should have known better, I was tricked by my inner Keanu fan. You know how sometimes you watch a flick so bad you feel like punching something? I wrote my first review. This nearly plot-less drivel was written by stunt actors. I didn't know stunt actors could write and direct. The answer is they cannot, specifically, not these guys behind this script. if you want stylish gun action, watch Equilibrium. If you want a great revenge movie, get Deathwish, Taken, Old Boy. I am going to watch Pointbreak, Speed and Matrix back-to-back to lift myself up from the utter let-down that was John Wick.

Gun fights are pretty much like OTT, might as well be from the movie ""Wanted"". The other guy, no-one knows (who he really is), he's a former CIA (presumed) assassin who plays vigilante and doesn't do cheesy Hollywood backflips with two guns drawn out.

Talking about the timeline, another downside is that the story is too flat, meaning that, in the duration of the movie, all the stories told are very simmilar with no action or drama to make them outstand.

The Irishman,"Ultimately this film is a tad on the boring side, and utterly self indulgent. I enjoyed the last hour or so, but the first hour in particular was a real slog to get through and I actually watched the film in 3 sittings, not due to time restraints, purely as I became too bored to continue twice. The casting of Combo from This Is England (I forget his name, some scouser) was dreadful, his attempt at the accent - I think it was New Jersey or similar, is absolutely dreadful and really stands out, easily the worst part of the film for me and he ruined every scene he was in. The real travesty in the film was the anti-aging used, it simply doesn't work. It's OK making De Niro look 50 again, but when he moves like an old man it's unintentionally hilarious, a scene where he beats someone up had me in stitches, you could blatantly tell it was an old man doing it, with some silly Toy Story style cgi making his face look younger. Of course you get the standard Rolling Stones song thrown in as per usual as well, I'm not sure if the director is unaware it's a parody now how he crowbars the same damn tune into every film he makes or he's in on the joke. I've given it a 6/10 as like I said, I enjoyed the last hour, and Joe Pesci is fantastic in it, it's really a shame he doesn't act anymore and I've really missed him the past two decades. Pacino however, well he's the same old hammy, shouty, over-acting self and it's clear why Scorsese hadn't worked with him previously - the guy can't act, and De Niro is De Niro, the man has one style no matter what role he's taking and his constant sniffing and breathing in only gets worse now he's ancient. All in all though, it's clearly a vanity project by Scorsese, and a last chance for him to get all his doddery old fart friends together before they all start dying. I'm baffled how this film is being lauded so highly, it's very mundane and in parts will make you almost fall asleep, De Niros performance is phoned in, Pacino is as awful as ever, the CGI is immersion breaking, when Gimme Shelter comes on AGAIN in a MS film you'll either laugh or roll your eyes, the Scouser playing an American stands out like a sore thumb and it's at least an hour too long. The only redeeming feature is the excellent Joe Pesci. If not for him appearing, and a decent last hour then I don't think I'd rate it any higher than a 4. It's clear to see why this ended up on Netflix, it's simply not good enough for a theatre release and people would have either walked out through sheer boredom, or fallen asleep. It'll be a real shame if this ends up being the last Scorsese film, or the last time you see Pesci and De Niro together as quite frankly, the film is dogsh**.","DEC 6, 2019",6,Crime

I'm under the impression that this is also a rather accurate historical movie with most respects, the attention to detail is also impressive. My only problem with the movie is that the middle drags on with very little happening apart from creating scene after scene of cliched mob dialogue, someone said something about you, oh did he well you tell him I said blah blah atc, and to be honest if it was split up and you put those scenes into other mob movies they would be great, but it's just a tab monotonous and loses its impact when you get the feeling that the mob is a little bit like mean girls.

The Irishman,First the positives. This movie is very watchable and brings a new element to Scorsese’s gangster films in being more of an autumnal look back from the vantage of old age. Now the negatives. DeNiro and Pacino are miscast. Frank Sheehan and Jimmy Hoffa were of Irish heritage. The likes of Liam Neeson would have been more appropriate as Sheehan. The middle section is repetitive and concentrating on Hoffa so much throws the movie off balance. Pacino in a bad hairpiece chewing the scenery doesn’t help. Bringing in the Kennedys etc has Scorsese treading into James Ellroy’s Underworld Trilogy territory. The female characters in the movie are afterthoughts. The pace is plodding and I didn’t know gangsters talked so much.,"JAN 10, 2020",6,Crime

The Irishman,"To start out, I'm going to have to agree with fellow user-reviewer shoulderoforion with most things. The thing I kept thinking most while watching Scorsese's new 10 lbs slowburner in a 5 lb wet bag, was 'how can the critics be giving this perfect scores. Did someone pay them off?' We've seen much better in the same style coming from Marty. And as shoulderoforion mentioned, the CGI young faces just aren't working for the film. Especially with De Niro. Al Pacino really shines in this. Giving a performance that I feel the rest of the cast just couldn't muster up. It's disjointed and longwinded and these are not adjectives I'd normally use for a Scorsese picture. This isn't going to be a popular sentence, but I really feel like this was a bit of a cheap shot. You don't really have any reason to care for most of the characters but Pesci & Pacino. Even Ray Romano gave a more ""there"" performance than Bobby. I would say watch it, and will even give it a 6 just for the big save by Pacino (but that's only a fraction of the film), and Joe Pesci's about-face to stoic, rather than his usual Goodfellas/Casino loud mouthing lovable weasel. The Irishman works on an odd recipe that is missing so much proverbial seasoning that you get from Goodfellas, Casino, the Departed and even Mean Streets despite it's coldness and preliminary nature in the grander picture of Marty films. Watch The Irishman. Definitely. Contort your, face puzzled at the blatant CGI. Take breaks out of boredom.... it's all worth it to see Pacino bring real sentiment to the table, and sell the role so well. That's the best thing I can say about Irishman. Pacino rocked the role of Hoffa. And the rest is all quite forgettable and at times cringeworthy with the de-aging CGI. 6 out of 10.","DEC 19, 2019",6,Crime

In fact, it feels nearly as if I'm watching all his films in one. Sadly, the story follows a path that many have seen before.

He does an impersonation of himself as a young man but he is moving like old man.

The Irishman,"My review: The Irishman is part of a dead genre that no one cares about anymore. It has no social importance or, more seriously, redemption. It is a movie about white men killing white men. There are no women, no blacks, no other ethnicities but Italians (even the “Irishman” is played by an Italian). Movies like this have littered the film landscape for 38 years since 1972’s The Godfather (which did the same thing but so much better, mainly because the genre was new). On a broader brush I say: Scorsese and Tarantino and the ilk should no longer have the power to make their pointless glorification of murder stories. It is long past time to let new voices with new visions into the boys club of directing and producing movies. I am a movie lover fed up with decades of stories about murderers. Make it stop.

We understand, this is a film about **** young people here... which had to be really rejuvenated by computer, the story taking place over several decades. So, we shouldn't be surprised if our poorly photoshopped old people look a bit like the Bogdanov brothers! it's clearly a failure and there's nothing to do, we can't get used to it... The other problem - also huge - concerns the narration and the rhythm which drag lamentably, because the film wanders at **** not like a fossil on his walker: it takes no less than 3h30 to get there... eventually but after an hour, the eyelids are already feeling heavy as this saga goes around in circles on itself- even like a senile Alzheimer's grandpa. The production naturally remains very careful and often elegant, the voice-over is indeed there but the fierce humor of Goodfellas or Casino has almost disappeared, diluted in the 3h30 of this long gala of veterans which never ends ...To sleep standing up, limp and outdated, The Irishman is only a very pale and poor shadow of the glories of times before but nostalgia is no longer in season, comrade, even if Netflix gets its hands on pocket, throwing the money out the windows... in vain.","DEC 1, 2019",2,Crime

I adore the original film from 2019 so was expecting big things from this sequel and I'm glad to note that it didn't disappoint - it's a cracker. I did, admittedly, predict the general gist of what was going to happen, though (in this case, minor) predictability doesn't always equel badness - like here, I was thoroughly entertained no matter what. The cast from the first film are better, though those that star in this 2022 release are excellent. Daniel Craig is, of course, superb as Benoit Blanc once again, every single moment with him is terrific. Janelle Monáe also gives a fantastic performance, I predominantly know of her from music but with this, and 'Hidden Figures', she can certainly act too. Kate Hudson, Dave Bautista and Edward Norton are the best of the others, though even the likes of Kathryn Hahn, Leslie Odom Jr. and Madelyn Cline are good value as well. Like its predecessor, it's very astutely cast. The film is put together in high quality fashion, Rian Johnson & Co. did a great job - particularly with the framing of certain shots, as well as the music which is real neat. As you'd expect for a film of this sort, there are some nice little details spread across the well utilised run time.

Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery,"Great sequel, building and improving on its predecessor, without following the terrible tendency that other films and shows in the genre take by simply rinsing and repeating the same formula. The central protagonist, played by Daniel Craig, is much more developed and involved in the plot progression than he was in the first movie. There is also significantly more humour, that is more topical, highlighting the ridiculousness of a range of current real world and internet stereotypes - in particular the ribbing of self-identified ""disruptors"" is excellent. As noted, the movie starts by following the overly well trodden path of other murder mysteries and, thankfully, quickly diverges, bringing something a little different. The movie makes much of references to the glass onion of it's title; something that is in plain sight, whilst still being shrouded in layers. Ironically, I expect the reverse may be true for some viewers, unable to discern and appreciate the layers of subtlety when presented with an apparently superficial plot. It is hard to know how a future film in the series can address this; the lack of a sledgehammer denouement is literally what makes the films worth watching, but is also a significant challenge to being popular with part of the audience.

However, not all the narrative choices make that much sense. The adrenaline rushed atmosphere felt at the beginning slowly fades away and the story doesnt become that interesting. The ending is quite lazy, but we must remember, the whole meaning of a 'Glass Onion' is something that shouldn't be overanalysed, and it relatively basic and simple. And so the movie lives up to its title. It's a very simple movie, not so much a mystery since most of the revelations are blurted out in one flashback scene.

Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery,"IN A NUTSHELL: The mysterious comedy was written, directed, and produced by Rian Johnson. More please! Instant request granted: once Netflix bought the rights for the third movie in this popular franchise, it began development! The third Knives Out movie doesn’t have a release date yet since the script hasn’t even been written yet, but it will mostly likely be out in 2024. This is the first Netflix movie to play in three movie theaters before premiering on Netflix: AMC, Regal, and Cinemark. The story is about the famed Southern detective, Benoit Blanc, whom we met in the first Knives Out movie. In this sequel, he travels to Greece for his latest murder mystery. Sequels always make me a little bit nervous because they have the reputation of being terrible and disappointing, but this one is a lot of fun and very good! Yay! THINGS I LIKED: The killer cast is extremely funny and 5 Oscar nominees, 1 Oscar winner, and includes Daniel Craig, Edward Norton, Kate Hudson, Dave Bautista, Janelle Monae, Kathryn Hahn, Leslie Odom Jr., Noah Segan, Ethan Hawke, Hugh Grant, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, and even Serena Williams. All of the actors look like they’re having a total blast. There is a lot of humor, both visual and spoken. Dave Bautista made me laugh every time he was on screen. The title gets its name from the Beatles song in the White Album. The first Knives Out movie also got its name from a song by Radiohead from their album Amnesiac. Fans of Knives Out will get a kick out of all the references to it and how some of the mentions are fleshed out in this sequel. I love twists. As an author and English professor, I thought the running gag of terrible vocabulary was hilarious. Fun fact: The Mona Lisa really was painted on wood, not canvas. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: I was worried the cast would wear face masks during the entire movie. This is a LONG movie! Some audiences will blame it on the decision to tell the story for a second time from a different perspective. It’s an interesting, yet time-consuming choice. TIPS FOR PARENTS: Profanity Some crude and offensive humor. Various weapons Destruction Several people flip the bird.","OCT 26, 2023",9,Crime
Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery,"I genuinely don't understand the hype hear. It's the exact same movie as the first - which I loved, but don't wish this could have been more (or at least different). The main character literally calls the plot of the movie dumb, in an incredibly meta moment of the film, and people cheered it to be a triumph. It was lazy and made no sense in the end. Nobody likely cares, but I think there was a better movie that could have been and it really sours this movie as a wasted opportunity... Andi should have been the villain. You don't have to change her backstory. Miles and everyone stole her idea and blocked her out. However, a napkin is hardly evidence of this. So, she spends years with hate, watching these people get rich off her ideas. She receives the puzzle box from Miles - which she destroys with a hammer - and this sets her plan in motion. Andi pretends to be her own twin and the movie plays out almost exactly as it already does. Her goal is to kill Miles, framing Duke for the murder, except her plan is foiled when Duke ends up drinking the poison in Miles' glass. No stupid miracle with the thin notebook stopping a bullet or hot sauce fake blood. Instead, contrary to Knives Out, Benoit actually misses this one - until the very end where she makes one critical mistake (it would be funny - given how much Craig has said to struggle with his southern accent - if her accent gave her away). He realizes it was Andi and although he gets credit for stopping her plan, he is distraught because his blindness for the damsel in distress - stemming from his experience in Knives Out - led to the death of an innocent man. This would have been the perfect place to leave Benoit for the inevitable end to the trilogy (or threequel if they continue to milk this dry). Self-doubting and unsure. Glass Onion would have been the antithesis to everything Knives Out got right and would have been far better, in my opinion.","JAN 17, 2023",5,Crime

Another thing is that the big, mid-movie plot twist doesn't make any sense. It also doesn't help that all of the characters are just unlikable. None of them have any redeeming qualities or the depth of humanity that De Armas and Plummer conveyed in the first one, and by the end you just want the story to get it over with which is kind of the way Benoit Blanc acts like if one were to be honest.

Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery,"I am not American, I am a New Zealander, so here is a proper review of the film for the other few hundred nations on earth they forgot about. What I mean by that is, as per my handle and as per my predictions years out on America's culture war, the conning of the Right from within and without... plus that the Right would storm the Capitol (two years out), I just know a thing or two. Unfortunately, many stateside do not. Like a good murder-mystery, I am on the outside looking in. I can judge you and objectively so. Firstly, opinions are not equal. If they're word for word? Then sure. Otherwise, the repeated sermons and idiocy of the Right could just be summed down to one comment and a zero and you should not publish their reviews metacritic. It destroys your credibility by virtue of the fact that they have none - and no scruples. Pure freedom is abuse. Anyhoo.... So, is Glass Onion good (rather than enjoyed because you are you a liberal or disliked because you are a sociopath trying to make America great and glorious, um, again... hang on, when was that again? When it was terrible for everyone but white men like me? Yeah, that is what you regressives mean... Evolve or become inconsequential at best.. that's what I would say to you dying horses)? Or disliked as Right Wingers hate Star Wars' recent updates (fair enough) for being too ""woke"" (unfair, they're just okay, bad, really bad as movies... not MandMs being too lezzy for you - women hold hands, deal with it and stop watching porn incels, you're just awful people who don't know it, no one owes you punks anything), not Winnie the Pooh or whoever you have next in line to whinge about because you confuse virtue-signalling, woke, social justice warriors and whatever else you project out of the embers of your total lack, for what is effectively your own refusal to understand you're a worse person and a Right Wing moron... it's basic stuff of course but 'cos you got played by the Right, needing the working class to elect them / to vote 'em in, to avoid education and the 'lying mainstream media' i.e. reality, lol... You've been prevented from epiphany both openly and stupidly.. Then you worship your abusers?... Bit sad and pathetic, just saying). Truth is though, deeply ironically, on this film, they're right, the Right, on this one and only occasion that I can recall out of about 67,832... Not the greatest strike-rate... I mean, give a monkey a typewriter. But it isn't bad for their reasons. It just isn't very good. For comparison, I would give the first one 8/10. Their (Right Wing sheep) low scores are a reflection of how much their defence-mechanisms have forced them to hate anything but themselves for losing their way and becoming monsters condemning their very own, but it would just go over their heads to explain that to planks of wood well past the point of no return. But you are in an awful mess.... and the Right are to blame. Their voters are victims but complicit enough that all must now suffer the same fate. That is very sad, but true and now necessary. Anyway, sorry if my opinion on all that upsets or angers, to alleviate somewhat any of your strong reactions necessary to conceal self-awareness, all I can offer is that it is entirely fact and only my opinion as it is fact. Rather than offer instinct and repeat brain-washings, I just have facts entirely occupy my opinion, then my opinion is fact. So, unfortunately, or fortunately if you still have your soul intact... I am indisputably right. And you lose. I hope that doesn't upset the overwhelming majority of incel males on the Right Wing who angrily sit at their keyboards and bring down user scores on MOST occasions because the film has a 'massage they do not like"" i.e. it reminds them they are awful. Ah well, **** it up buttercup. Enjoy the film... or not. It is okay at best and has glaring issues with plot and contrivance that, as a writer, I find spoil the whole thing for me. I was also pretty sure who the 'killer(s)' was/were. Those are the faults. The stupidity, racism , projections and backwardness of the sheeple on the Right are alternatively far, far more frequent and far less forgivable.

Why else watch this one although this could be a standalone film for the most part. This is a good film with a potentially good plot, but the film tries much harder to push a political agenda and an estut person will easily figure out the 'evil rich white man bad' ""twist"". The movie itself has some great shots, clever dialogue, and stellar acting. Unfortunately, every evil character is some caricature of what the director Rian Johnson, thinks a republican is. One is tatooed 'F YEAH MURICA!' gun carrying dumb dumb, the blonde woman is basically Trump tweeting stupid stuff and not taking the virus seriously, Edward Norton is the rich white man who wants to oppress black people. Rian is not subtle with these characters and thus it is obvious from very early on that the rich white guy who likes to oppress black people and funds republican stereotypes has an evil plan to *surprise* oppress black people and steal their work. Were the acting not good, the characters would be laughably one dimensional. Rian, I don't want to know who the bad guy is after meeting him for five minutes. Learn subtly. The best is when you give these evil characters redeeming qualities so they don't become blaring stereotypes with evil intentions. You know? Like in the first movie! The climax of the film is extra cringe. The hide-away virtuous victim holds the 'evidence' to lock up the evil racist white man in his face (like the first movie), and of course, he lights it on fire. I awaited for her to pull some clever trick, but instead she decides to just start rioting and destroying all of evil rich man's stuff. For some reason, the evil republican lackeys start to cheer her on and do it themselves. Evil rich white man of course wasnt smart enough to install a camera where he holds the mona lisa, so they get away with it. Rian clearly wants to portray a 'pro-riot' message for BLM. It just feels out of place and cringe. It's really too bad because the first Knives out also had some political agenda but it never interfered with the plot or made the characters too shallow.

But I hoped for some changes after Wednesday. And yes - terrible, unfunny ending. It looked like an uprising in kindergarten.","DEC 28, 2022",1,Crime

Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery,"I was already skeptical about naming a sequel movie ""A Knives Out Mystery"" simply because Knives Out was amazing. It felt like trying too hard, which was exactly what this movie was. The characters were the opposite of subtle, when subtlety is what the original movie thrived on. Everyone acted completely illogically, the character's motivations and relationships didn't make sense. Even Benoit Blanc fell prey to the poor writing epidemic once or twice, although he was the best part of the show. Overacting reigned supreme and I guess the producer thought if there were enough off-color jokes, attractive people, and beautiful CGI, we might not notice that the movie doesn't begin to attain to the title ""Mystery"".","JAN 2, 2023",1,Crime

Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery,"I can't believe how overrated this film is. I enjoyed Knives Out, but Glass Onion is such an inferior sequel that the amount of praise it's receiving is absolutely mind-boggling. The movie was clearly filmed during the pandemic, and they even reference these events in the movie, which really takes you out of the viewing experience. On its face, it seems like it should be a fun movie, it's a murder mystery with an all-star cast, but there are so many reasons why this movie **** most obvious and glaring issue with Glass Onion is the insanely massive plot hole that becomes apparent after the second act ""reveal."" The tech mogul billionaire played by Edward Norton had invited a group of his closest friends to play a murder mystery game. But we later find out that the woman named Andy was someone that he actually murdered shortly before this rendez-vous, yet he inexplicably invites her to his private island anyway. What in the actual F? Why would he invite her if he had already killed her? It turns out that the woman who ends up arriving at the island is her twin sister trying to investigate Andy's murder while posing as Andy, along with the ""world's greatest detective"" Benoit Blanc played by Daniel Craig. It seems that Miles, Edward Norton's character, would've known about Andy's twin sister at some point, yet he acts completely surprised to see her. Even the way Andy is murdered is absurdly stupid, and she was supposed to be the brains behind Miles' company. She invites Miles into her house KNOWING that he had an ulterior motive, then proceeds to let him prepare a drink for her that was spiked with sleeping pills, and he ends up putting her in a running car in her garage to die of carbon monoxide poisoning. This ""tech genius"" Andy basically let herself get **** of this reeks of lazy writing and bad storytelling. It's almost like they wrote the script up until a certain point, then didn't know how to finish the movie so they went with the ""twin sister surprise."" Aside from the various plot holes, there are many other issues going on with Glass Onion. The movie tries way too hard to be funny, and the dialogue usually just sounds cringy and pretentious. None of the characters are truly likable, and Kate Hudson's performance was downright irritating and grating with her shrilling like a harpy half the time. There are tons of unnecessary political references. Daniel Craig and Janelle Monae have horribly forced southern accents that are borderline offensive. Even the scientific concepts they introduce are ridiculously flawed, because the entire island is supposed to be hydrogen-powered, which is supposedly in its gaseous form within the vents after leaking from the pipes causing a massive explosion later on. If this kind of energy was truly harnessed, then its potential as an explosive hazard would be far less than methane since hydrogen molecules rapidly dissipate within the atmosphere. The film also shows a solid form of hydrogen as the cause of the explosion, which in reality is impossible to maintain at any temperature above -260 degrees Celsius.Overall, the movie was a huge step down from the previous film. The insane plot contrivances, contradictory plot lines, annoying and uninteresting characters, and flawed scientific assumptions were all factors why this movie didn't work for me. Rian Johnson is quickly becoming one of the worst and most overrated directors in Hollywood. Knives Out probably should've been left as a one-off, but anything remotely successful has to be franchised now. Going forward, I hope they actually research hypothetical scientific concepts and try to have a better writing team for the script. This movie also felt overly comedic compared to Knives Out, which was another aspect that soured me on this film. I'm definitely in the minority with my opinion, but I just did not have as much fun with this movie as most other people.","JAN 5, 2024",2,Crime

Sorry to those that enjoyed this one, but 20 minutes into the film, and I'm struggling to hang on. It just wasn't entertaining. The script is average at best, and Daniel Craig just seems to be miscast, as I really thought his performance was flat. One other thing I noticed, and then confirmed only after I saw the film- is the attempt at social commentary. Rian Johnson and I would probably agree on 90% of political issues, however, I think he is thinking of the commentary first, and story second. It seems that his thinking while writing goes something like, ""This would make a good parody of so and so hated politician, and boy, that would be funny in this story."" It is too much of a sledge hammer so it isn't subtle at all, and that just makes it unenjoyable when the rest of the film is already struggling.

The rest of the characters were mediocre, except for Birdie, who was obnoxious, loud and annoying. She screamed way too much. Way too much! She was pointless, tedious and loud.

Fast X,"IN A NUTSHELL: Dom Toretto and his family are targeted by the vengeful son of drug kingpin Hernan Reyes. The high-octane summer flick distributed by Universal Pictures was directed by Louis Leterrier. Writing credits go to Justin Lin and Dan Mazeau. THINGS I LIKED: Just like the movie itself, the cast is stuffed. The awesome cast is packed full with fan favorites: Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Jason Statham, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Charlize Theron, John Cena, Brie Larson, Scott Eastwood, Jason Momoa, and SO many more! It takes only a few minutes before the first car chase and action sequences begin. After that, it’s pretty non-stop adrenaline. We get a lot of fun cameos, so no spoilers! Jason Momoa/Aquaman is hilarious and awesome as an over-the-top villain. His changing hairstyles and gold fingernail polish kept me entertained as he shined on the screen and stole every scene he was in. He looked like he was having an absolute blast making this movie. It’s great to see Rita Moreno. She looks fantastic, as always. Helen Mirren! Yes! She’s such a national treasure. Lots of visual and spoken humor. Almost non-stop action with entertaining and sometimes cool fight sequences. We get to travel around the world in the movie. I always love that. If you’re a fan of this franchise, you’ll be happy to know there WILL be a sequel. Keep watching during the final rolling credits for another scene with important information for the next Fast installment, and a fun cameo performance. The movie is delightfully self-aware, as well as completely cognizant of what the fans want. For that, audiences have awarded the film a high 86% on Rotten Tomatoes. Unfortunately, film critics are less impressed, scoring the movie a low 54%. What did YOU think? It definitely feels like a summer blockbuster with all the epic scenes and big moments you’d expect and want. Congrats to the stunt team for their excellent work. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: The movie ends abruptly without resolving everything. The film felt unfinished even though it was SO long. All of the main characters get their moment in the movie; however, not all of the characters’ situations are resolved. Some characters get completely dropped after their moment and we never see them again. SPOILER: What happened to the traditional Fast and Furious with the family all eating together at a BBQ? The movie ended more like the Avengers Endgame with characters scattered all over the place. There are a lot of flashbacks that might confuse new viewers about the timeline. There are a lot of characters to keep track of. Newbies won’t quite understand how everyone is connected, nor appreciate their backstories.

Fast X,"These days Fast and the Furious Movies are not what they were. Back in the old days of Paul Walker and Tokyo Drift, it was about racing and some little High stakes drama on the side, now it's all about High octane CGI Action, with just absurdity everywhere you look. Now from a critic's point of view, this is a bad film in almost all respects. CGI, in some shots, is uncanny to the trained eye. Dialogue is piss poor, and jokes primarily don't land, some do but are not executed as well as they should. Characters, there are too many characters, and the film will cut from here, to here, to there breaking the film's focus, especially at the end. Action is ridiculous and just does not work in a realistic manner. Lack of Racing, just trying to save the world again, and of course the family. It cuts a little too much but most of the cuts are effective in use. Weirdly dramatic, This is only if you are new to the franchise or don't remember the past 1, 2, 3...9 films. So with all these problems why on earth do I give this a 7, It is just purely entertaining, when the action is on even during the fight scenes, my eyes are glued to the screen. Look I don't like Fast and the Furious movies besides Tokyo Drift and another numbered sequel that I totally forgot. (Oh god, I'm gonna have to watch all of these movies and rate them, help me, lord). You can't turn your back on Family *cough, Ratings. CGI: 9/10, fun action. Plot and Story: 6/10, it makes sense I guess, it's a plot but it doesn't tie the film together well. Characters: 5/10, Too many characters, some acting ****, and that poor bar owner's ceiling. Racing: 2/10, A drag race really, that's the best you can come up with, tell me when Tokyo Drift 2 is out. Writing and Dialogue: 5/10, they Tried something, It wasn't great but it was something. Family: 5/10, you'll see why. So 7/10, it's an entertaining film that meets a requirement of an entertaining film, do you need to go out and see this, No, Do you need to see it also no, but if you are deciding to watch a movie to switch off your mind and just get wrapped up in some action and destruction then this is the movie, you won't be disappointed, you won't be satisfied but you will be left with wanting to see how it all ends up. Maybe I'm a bit too easy with F & F movies, but hey I went in wanting to see action right here and right now, and that's what I got. This I would say is like the Avengers Infinity War of F & F Movies, I guess thanks to Jason Momoa. If the Next movie is sufficiently better than this then I would be pleased. If not then the rating of this movie will go down I was battling between 6 and 7. Let's hope they saved the goods for the next one so we can end this Franchise on a High Note.","JUN 13, 2023",7,Crime

Fast X,"I don't think it's fair to say that the ""fast and the furious"" franchise doesn't have a script, even though it's not the intention to complicate things too much, there is a very clear script, a very Manichaean conflict between villains on the one hand and heroes attached to the morals of the nuclear family on the other, fighting with hundreds and thousands of weapons and ammunition in the most outrageous scenes in action cinema. Of course, the script has a series of concessions, characters that arrive at the right moment, car rolls and millimetrically calculated explosives, but this is all part of the package the film proposes and is actually fun. But the film's greatest asset is the creation of characters, and how much this same script makes a point of reserving space for each one, with their own dramas and personalities. Take ""abuelita"", for example, even in a tiny appearance, she manages to leave her mark. That's why ""Fast"" works so well, like the Marvel franchise ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", because it focuses on what its great potential is: creating truly interesting characters. Based on this creation, the villain played by Momoa is truly hilarious, a mix of the Johny Deep pirate and the most vile of drug swindlers, with a high dose of humor and a lot of talk, after all, it is necessary to explain everything to the audience of this film. what happens on screen. That said, everything is more of the same. The ease with which they move between countries, with which secondary characters become bestialized, with explosions happening and people simply drinking coffee (see the scene in Rome). The concessions don't stop, and here it's even worse with continuity errors (only after Dom's scene in Rio, one of the characters says that he was in Rio) and with a villain who had the hero literally under his feet, and not the crushed who knows why. Oh yes, he should suffer. And it takes more than two hours to suffer. But to be fair, he is not sufferable. The action once again turns into absurdist comedies, in breathtaking scenes, and it must be said that they are very well filmed! So for what it proposes, the film is truly excellent, there is a constant adrenaline-pumping track and, with quick but not confusing editing, it is capable of entertaining. The film also features a small appearance by the singer Ludmila, reinforcing certain stereotypes of Brazilianness, but who cares? The film is good and achieves its objective, it manages to deal with a flood of characters competently and is a lot of fun. Let 11 come?","MAY 28, 2023",6,Crime
Fast X,"Behind every ""running on fumes"" and ""bumpy road"" pun is a film fan just cynical and morbidly curious enough to see this nutty franchise out, I swear to God. While there are sadly no dinosaurs or sharks to be jumped in this installment, ""Fast X"" thankfully delivers on absurdity in the form of Jason Momoa's turn as possibly the saga's most bombastic retcon to date. This guy's in a totally different movie. Imagine if Castor Troy and Simon Phoenix's lovechild had a ""gang weed""/""society"" phase. Like, the character is so cringeworthy that it sort of horseshoes its way around to being the most entertaining part of the film and, yes, I do mean that as a compliment. You're also given a bevy of those ""of course they brought that character back"" moments, all of which only add on to the franchise's ironically unironic trademark of shameless self-perpetuation.

Fast X,"Fast X A big splashy pile of rubbish. The plot is a poor rehash of the former movies, with nothing new or compelling to it. The performance by the cast is mostly bland, except for Jason Momoa and John Cena. This is the most impassive and drab portrayal of Dominic Toretto by Vin Diesel, and this is especially frustrating, as this is meant to be the beginning of the end of this franchise. The supporting characters are numerous, but due to the short screentime and unceremonious entry they have, they all seem like an endless introduction of cameos. Jason Momoa as the villain of this movie is the best thing. He's charismatic and campy, and his jokeresque performance is refreshing. John Cena also gives a good performance, with a good blend of bravado and hilarity. This franchise is hinged on farfetched action but this instalment is sheer dumb, and the funny ridiculousness that the former instalments have is absent here. The CGI is not good, and the direction and editing can be choppy at times, this is especially poor seeing as this is the sixth most expensive movie ever made, wonder where all the money went, probably to the sprawling uninteresting cast. 3.5/10","JUN 17, 2023",4,Crime
Fast X,"""Fast X: A Convoluted Ride Hindered by Overcrowded Characterization and Missed Emotional Opportunities"" Rating: 2/5 stars ""Fast X"" speeds onto the screen with a whirlwind of high-octane action, but its convoluted storytelling and crowded character development detract from the overall experience. While the film showcases standout performances by Jason Momoa and John Cena, it fails to strike a balance between character moments and a cohesive narrative, leaving emotional depth in its wake. One of the film's major shortcomings lies in its convoluted plot, weighed down by an excessive number of side stories. It often feels as though the movie is more interested in introducing and applauding each character than weaving them into a satisfying and coherent narrative. The result is an elongated TV episode that struggles to tell a proper story, leaving viewers longing for a more focused and engaging experience. Amidst the chaos, Jason Momoa's performance as the villain shines as a delightful and gleeful standout. His portrayal injects much-needed energy into the film, but it can't fully compensate for the uninteresting treatment of previous villains and the downplayed emotional moments from earlier installments. The film's attempt to uplift Momoa's character at the expense of these crucial elements diminishes the impact of what came before, leaving fans yearning for a more balanced and respectful continuation of the franchise's established emotional resonance. Furthermore, the overcrowding of character moments leaves little room for the ensemble cast to breathe. While John Cena's character and sub-plot are highlighted as another positive aspect of the film, the predictability leading up to these moments undermines their impact. The film's eagerness to give each character a moment of their own sacrifices the opportunity for genuine character development, leaving some feeling underutilized and the overall narrative feeling disjointed. Despite its flaws, ""Fast X"" still delivers exhilarating action sequences and impressive visual effects. The adrenaline-fueled spectacle and the charismatic presence of the cast provide moments of excitement and entertainment. However, these highlights are overshadowed by the film's failure to strike a cohesive balance between its characters, storylines, and emotional resonance. In conclusion, ""Fast X"" struggles to find its footing amidst its convoluted storytelling and overcrowded character moments. While standout performances by Jason Momoa and John Cena add sparks of brilliance, the film falls short in honoring the emotional depth of previous installments and fails to give its ensemble cast the breathing room they deserve. Die-hard fans may find elements to enjoy, but for those seeking a well-crafted and emotionally resonant experience, ""Fast X"" fails to live up to its predecessors.","MAY 30, 2023",4,Crime

Fast X,"After literally 10 installments, I've figured out what Fast X is: it's a telenovela with cars. Characters changes sides all the time, sometimes they die and get resurrected. But like any telenovela, it tends to over stay their welcome. It's the equivalent of eating junk food; those first few bites are great, but eventually you feel a bit bloated afterwards. Fast X is a somewhat return to form to this franchise after 9 literally broke the realm of possibility. This installment still has crazy stunts but are dialed to a more 'realistic' level. As in Fast V, the saving grace of this series are its guest 'villain' and this time around is Jason Momoa, whose Dante Reyes' is probably the best villain that the saga has so far. His flamboyant and charismatic performance elevate this installment. No surprise here, this flick actually ends in a cliffhanger, and surprisingly, I am looking forward to it.","MAY 20, 2023",6,Crime

Fast X,"Imagine that you are the 10th film in the same saga and that because of the way each one of its installments has been constructed, you yourself have become your biggest disadvantage. And by that I mean that due to your constant need to outdo yourself with each new movie, each of these has become more ridiculous. If it were a car, this franchise by now would be burning its fourth engine, holding desperately to an artificial life in an extreme budget splurge that delivers for the tenth time an explosive but also excessively vacuous and repetitive film. The story? Same old same old. Someone with a grudge against Toretto who is also a brutal criminal mastermind who has a whole arsenal of henchmen at his disposal to destroy him and his family and therefore that whole show doesn't mean **** It's worthless and meaningless. There's no emotion or drama to it. This is a circus and like in any circus, the clowns must dance. You have no interest in watching them do anything else. Jason Momoa as the villain steals the entire show from Vin Diesel because Momoa understands that he has to embrace the ridicule while Diesel believes flat out that he has to play it seriously. Fast X is sheer audiovisual nonsense. The spectacle is still present and that is merely the only compelling reason that makes this somehow still bearable for viewers who are not fans of the saga. Because otherwise the 100% genuine enjoyment only belongs to those fans. I'm not going to say I won't see the other two remaining films, if it's indeed true that this will actually become a trilogy to conclude the whole thing, and that's mostly because that's one of my rules, but in each and every area this franchise has absolutely nothing else to offer other than the scale of its explosions continues to grow.","MAY 19, 2023",4,Crime

I mean it felt like they just cram everything in, do not think too much about dialogue and thats it. Plus I hate when they split movies in many parts and this did not even really have an ending as there will be second part - that also majorly let me down.

Fast X,"Fast X is an unabashed next step in this series’ mission to depict escalating vehicular mania. It’s certainly enjoyable and even thrilling at points, but it does lack some novelty. As Fast X speeds the Fast and Furious franchise into its final lap, it can’t help but feel like we’re going in circles. Fast X follows Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) as they raise their son away from their enemies and the battles that have taken up much of their time for decades. Dominic’s friends and soldiers of the wheel—Roman (Tyrese Gibso), Tej (Ludacris), and Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) —all go on a mission to Rome, Italy, for an underground government organization. However, the mission isn’t real and both the agency and Dom’s pals are duped by an old foe that emerges from the shadows to exact revenge on Dom and his family. This villain, Dante (Jason Momoa), threatens to break Dom’s family into pieces, so the family must figure out how to save themselves from Dante and new government agents who have Dom in their crosshairs. These Fast and Furious characters used to steal TVs off of moving trucks—now they save the Vatican. These movies succeed most when they know what they are and what you want. It’s a rollercoaster, so at a certain point you just throw your hands up and enjoy the ride. Dominic Toretto is basically inhuman by now; nothing can kill him and he can bend the laws of reality and science to his will. Action is the primary draw of these films—story has become secondary as the saga of Dom and his band of street racers turned superheroes cruises into its 11th entry. Fast X, however, goes all in on plot, which feels like a miscalculation. Especially as the second half refuses to reach any kind of conclusion, barreling towards a silly cliffhanger that does little to maintain the stakes the first half establishes. None of the racers we’ve come to know and love are safe, but the way Fast X wraps up, it’s hard not to feel like all of them are. Jason Momoa is unbelievable in this movie as Dante. He’s easily the best villain Dom and the crew have ever fought against. This level of gleeful, over-the-top evil is hard to find in any movie, but it’s a gift in the heightened world of Fast and Furious. He gets all the movie’s best laughs—you almost wish he would crush Dominic’s world so we could watch him laugh, twirl, and dance as it all goes up in flames. John Cena’s a lot of fun, too. He takes a page from Momoa’s playbook, an action hero who loses the self-seriousness and has a good time playing uncle to Dom’s young son. Tyrese Gibson is ever a delight as Roman. Gibson always has a lot fun with this role, and he understands exactly what energy he must bring to keep the franchise full of life. Practically every time he comes on screen, the audience erupts into laughter. I give Fast X 3 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, for some language, frequent intense action and some graphic violence. Fast X zooms into theaters on May 19, 2023. Vroom vroom.

Fast X,"I was disappointed by certain aspects of the movie. Firstly, the decision to bring back a scene with Paul Walker, accompanied by the same song from the credits, felt unnecessary. We had already experienced the emotional impact of his loss in Fast 7, which served as a fitting and heartfelt send-off. Additionally, I found it disappointing that none of the characters faced any real risk or consequences throughout the movie. The absence of danger diminished the tension and made it feel like the characters had unlimited lives, detracting from the sense of realism. The inclusion of a remote control toy car was particularly underwhelming. As someone who typically refrains from leaving reviews, I felt compelled to share my thoughts on this occasion. It is puzzling to me how someone could perceive this movie as amazing, considering that I found myself bored and disengaged after just 40 minutes.

All of my Fast and Furious films, especially after the seventh film in the series which was a kind of climax that I think would have been better to stop at, are based on the so-called ""wow effect"", which is basically sitting the people in front of the film, making them say wow every second and that's how you keep them watching another one. At least there was more charm and flavor to these movies during the peak years, because today I felt like I was watching a Marvel movie from 2014-2017, every movie that came out there was a two-hour trailer for the one that came after it. And this whole movie felt like one long, continuous and tedious trailer. No plot, but with lots of wow. And there is absolutely wow here - the film is technically great. Every shot here is excellent, the cinematography is phenomenal, the effects are convincing, and the editing is fluid and intriguing. There are even good tempo transitions here! Umm, that's not enough. There is no intriguing plot narrative here, everything is predictable and clichéd, and by and large - feels like the spoiled version of ""Captain America: Civil War"". Did I enjoy the viewing experience? Sure, I watched it in IMAX, so it's impossible not to enjoy it. Will I ever watch the movie again? Not sure. Maybe only from an initiated marathon of the Fast and Furious series. And most importantly - what is the bright spot? There are two. The first is all the scenes with John Cena, who turns out to be a wonderful actor, even if the script mainly draws from him clichés and laughs, and the second is Jason Momoa, who for the first time since Jason Statham entered our lives in Mr. Shaw, provides here a quality, intriguing villain And one that will be remembered a year from now as the bright spot of a pretty dumb movie. Well made - but very dumb. The family that came with me of course had a great time, but I have a bitter taste in my mouth when I go to a movie like this.

Fast X,"The movie is 95% action, 5% character development, 0% logic. To be enjoyable, you will need to switch off your brain while watching. In the fast n furious world, stereotypes are the norm and the laws of physics bend to the will of the protagonists. The priority of the movie is to deliver increasingly ridiculous action scenes. Because science and logic doesn't even apply, there is little suspense as to how much danger the protagonists are supposed to be in. Instead, it's just a wowfest of explosions and bad judgements. To make matters worse, the dialog and characters are so very flawed. Spoilers here but the story is supposedly around this 'rough around the edges' gang that value family and do good in the world by being badass. Yet, when they were framed and hunted by the law instead, it became very ok to kill the law enforcers who they were working with before and are just doing their job. In another scene, I grimaced in the cinema as Dom lectures to Dante about how silly he is for not building a family but instead focusing on revenge... Yet, the whole plot of the movie is based on Dante who forms a vendetta against Dom for killing his only family member; his dad. Ironically, we also see Dom killing many people in the name of trying to save his family as well as for revenging those he had lost... In another scene we see Dom abandoning his friend to a car bomb. But because it was just a close friend who stuck up for him and not 'family', it was a non-event for Dom even after seeing his friend explode in front of him, as well as partly being the reason for it.

Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),"This movie is so unbelievably underrated. This movie was always going to be divisive and i totally understand why people do not like it however I feel like many people dismiss it as ""feminist propaganda"". This is not the case. While it is true that nearly all the leads are females and all the males in it are bad guy, if this movie was released 10 years ago people would not have had anywhere near the negative reaction they have to it now. Now i've got all of that out of the way this movie is fantastic. The R rating was a great idea as it allowed the violence and swearing to run free which is exactly how a Harley Quinn movie should be. In other movies the jumping around with the story could be jarring and tiring, this movie manages to find the right balance between making sense and being crazy like Harley. The comedy in this movie is used well to balance out the moments of extreme violence. The visuals are bright and stylish. The action sequences in particular feel fully formed and stylish. The acting is all really good with the highlights being Margot Robbie and Ewan McGregor but the whole cast is excellent too. I feel like before people see this movie they just instantly dismiss it but it is just so much fun if you can get over your bias. While it may not be perfect I just keep finding myself watching it over and over gain as it is just so much fun.","OCT 19, 2021",9,Crime

Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),"Birds of Prey is a decent DCEU movie and earns redemption for Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn after the mess that was Suicide Squad. The writing, directing and story give Quinn much more depth, make her a more interesting character, and allow us to get to know her much more than we were able to in Suicide Squad. BoP does a nice job of emphasizing Quinn’s anarchic and wild spirit and personality without having her be overshadowed by other characters, which really gives her room to shine and show us who Quinn truly is. The fight sequences are pretty good and entertaining, although they don’t quite live up to ones that we saw in Aquaman. This movie serves as a palate cleanser for both Quinn and viewers. Quinn is forced to fend for herself as a result of her actions early in the film and is put in difficult situations, so this isn’t a great palate cleanser for her, but her life is changed in big ways and we see her go through a bit of an arc. For viewers, this is a DCEU film where stakes and ramifications are pretty low since this is a movie about a character who has liberated herself and is on the run because of that, which is a nice breath of fresh air from movies with much higher stakes like Aquaman. We can sit through this movie knowing that there won’t be a fight that destroys a city or some kind of alien invasion, a luxury we don’t have with so many other comic book films. All of this makes BoP a better movie than a lot of its predecessors and more easy and fun to watch. That said, BoP isn’t a perfect movie by any means. The dialogue and interactions between characters goes a bit over the top on many occasions when Quinn gets a bit too wild and anarchic and some of the lines are cheesy and unnecessary. There are relatively minor things that get way too much attention which distracts from the bigger picture of the movie and gives the script a bit of wild and anarchic vibe of its own, which doesn’t work at a few points in the movie. BoP is a movie that you kinda have to push through at moments so you can get to the good stuff, but when you get there, it really gets going and delivers the entertainment that fans watch comic book movies for. Overall, BoP has its flaws but is a huge step in the right direction for Harley Quinn and is a solid entry in the DCEU.","AUG 7, 2021",8,Crime

Ewan McGregor completely steals the show in what might be his best performance, completely devouring the scenery with his insane expressions and bizarre dialogue. As a fan of the comics it's also fun seeing Zsasz as Black Mask's sidekick. Margo Robbie reprises her role as the only good thing about suicide squad, and Montoya was a surprisingly likeable addition to the team. The effects were great, the plot was stupid, and the soundtrack was inspired. The sequence were Harley imagines her current situation as a music video was pretty hilarious as well.

R-rated classification for the characters that need it for them to be there true selves.

Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),"Birds of Prey wasn't a very efficient movie. First I really dislike the narrating part of the movie. Harley talks too fast and has a noisy voice. That doesn't qualified well for narration. The structure of the movie was lazy at best. If you are to use flashback, use it in an interesting way. The story took too long to united all the girls. Huntress was interesting but barely got dialogs and time. The action was good especially at the end. The acting was really good but some actors had poor lines. The humor from Harley was sadly boring. I give it 60%. I felt at times it was more a McGregor movie then Margot.

Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),"Positive - The sense of humour, the choreography, the cast. We got to see Black Mask as we know on the big screen for the first time. Negative - Everything else. You know that feeling when you're eating a biryani and accidentally a piece of clove comes in your mouth which ruins the whole thing? That's exactly what this film is. Just when everything is going very well something will ruin it. The climax scene where Harley kills Roman was so badly ruined by that grenade part. The final fight where Harley opens the wardrobe and finds there are no weapons was so nice, but that roller skate fight ruined it. The part where Black Mask asks a girl to stand on the table and dance, the part where the restaurant owner betrays Harley, and most importantly the fact that Cassandra ATE the diamond (I literally rolled my eyes on that one. How did she not die immediately?) were all so cringy. The costumes were also so bad. To make them less sexualised, they ended up making it perfect for someone with an abdomen kink.

Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),"The beginning is good, the narration method that is used, in addition to the game of going back in time, returning to the present and returning again, is decent, although later it is abandoned but there is not much problem. Then with its development that seems to be a change in our protagonist or something that helps her forget Mr. J, it ends up being more than everything turning into a gem and honestly a plot that does not help much or does not make her character arc good . The outcome has nothing to say. The characters themselves are not bad, but the girl is not at all charismatic, totally insufferable, Harley's turning points have nothing to do with it, and well, a very average script that is practically weak. If I had to say something good, it's that the action scenes are obviously not all of them, but most of them are decent, although that part about the skates with the car and the motorcycle, ufff, nothing to do with it, but oh well. In general, with her bat and hammer she is decent, I didn't find it entertaining but that is more my personal taste. A direction that is good at least technically.","AUG 7, 2021",4,Crime

Opinion: I am not going to deny that it is very funny, it is as if Kill Bill and Deadpool had had a daughter, but born at 13 months, the action scenes in slow motion and among other things, make this movie feel very cliché, but in general it serves to entertain.

Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),"It was no Suicide Squad, so it has that going for it. Otherwise it's just a middle of the road movie that generally avoids falling on its face as it admirably but lazily tries to work DC's character development muscles out of atrophy. The other three titular Birds tend to blend into the wallpaper of Harley's character arc, Zsasz is extremely un-Zsasz-like, and the story repeatedly tries too hard to pull off the same old beats, but I can't give it too much crap. Anytime DC makes a movie that achieves mere passability, I stop and take notice.

Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),"The thing about birds of prey is that it isn't as bad as people say, however it is not DC's best movie. The other characters are hardly in this movie and most of the time its just harley which would be fine but this movie is called birds of prey so... what happened. I would put the score much lower however there are good things in this movie like the action which is fun and colorful and the jokes can be good but most of the time they are kind of dumb. The final thing I should bring up is the villan Roman Sionis which is an interesting case since he gets lots of screen time. I do like him the acting was great for him but he has no motevation outside of money which is so stupid because he is the riches guy in gotham so why more money. However there is another issue with the movie and the villan that being the face peeling scene, this scene come out of no where and is super disturbing and I want it to get off my mind since its just there for shock value.

The movie starts good, and the quality drops. Harley Quinn is fine. Huntress is somewhat good. She is somewhat good, because her origins and motivations are similar to the comics. Every other was mediocre to boring. Rene Montoya is a weak version, a weak detective, at least the versions we (I) are most familiar. Black Canary ""debt"" did bother me.

It's really evident that the director and the people behind this really had a blast working on it. Although, I thought the script is a bit messy and the first ~40 minutes of this are spent with setting up plot-lines through constant flashbacks which I wasn't too much of a fan of.

Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),"Acting: Everyone does a great job bringing their characters to life and doing the best possible with a very meh script. Particular standout for me was Huntress, as she gets only about 5 minutes of screen-time in total, but every second was solid gold and made me forget about the flaws of the movie. Action: Mostly good. Great in the first half, noticeable dip in quality for the final few scenes. Music/Sound: Great Story: Mediocre. The most interesting characters get the least amount of screen-time (possible that they're the most interesting BECAUSE we're not hit over the head over and over with their story). Very ham-fisted storytelling. There is no subtlety in this movie. None. If there's a plot point, you'll see it again at least once (and probably thrice). In the entire movie there is a total of one male character who is not a villain. There's an entire fight scene with a bunch of people trying to kill Harley for no reason at all (not to be confused with all of those who are doing so for a reason, or those who are doing so for a bad reason, or those that don't care about Harley but she's in the way). It's possible there is a background character seen crossing the street who isn't a villain, but even then, I'm pretty sure he was jaywalking. A couple friends saw the movie after I did, who absolutely loved everything about the movie. They agreed with my assessment of there being no men that weren't actively villainous, and they felt that was perfectly fine. The movie is perfectly meh, and deserving of 5-6; I'd normally round up, but because of their thoughts I'm rounding down instead.","MAR 6, 2020",5,Crime

The film ends with a taste of satisfaction with the result, but sad due to low expectations and for those looking for expansion of the DC universe a disappointment, I was in doubt between 6 and 7, but I believe it deserves a 6.5.","AUG 21, 2020",6,Crime

Unfortunately, it's so simple you can spot the ending from a mile away. Is it fun? Eh, kinda. There are a lot of elaborate, visually interesting set-pieces, and not much tying them together. You watch Harley creatively take out nameless thugs who can't figure out how to point and shoot. I watched this movie in halves because I was falling asleep in the middle. I think the main problem is the characters. This version of Harley Quinn does not make for much of a main character. It doesn't help that the side characters are never really fleshed out. One lingers in the background, unnamed for almost all of the movie. The main villain is a real bad guy, but why does anyone tolerate his twisted torture?

So, an entire film dedicated to Harley with of course “Super Margot” which is still in great shape, we can only rejoice! Harley is therefore very good for a good part of the film... until she becomes a little soft despite a start at the very end (still) but this harms her reputation a little as a psychopathic weirdo, I have to to say... That being said, this is not the only problem with a film edited a little out of order (too many flashbacks) and whose general tone is a little too sassy to not be suspect... Furthermore, the feminist agenda is particularly clumsy, especially conveyed by the three other idiots who accompany and handicap our favorite Harley. Let's not forget McGregor as a ""special guest star"" in the role of the bad guy who histrionics like a furious dachshund and... I think the cup is full! Fortunately, everything is not so dark (yet...) and the action remains fairly well staged with some very graceful slow motion shots of the overexcited Harley here and there. Overall, I have the impression that DC wanted to compete with Marvel's irreverent and ""too cool"" Deadpool but a little less successful (for the first one anyway!)... or a little worse in short .

Birds of Prey (And the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn),"Over the past few years DC Comics has seemed intent on turning Harley Quinn into their very own Deadpool, complete with fourth wall breaking antics and everything. While this has led to some amusing results and is responsible for much of the character's ever-growing popularity, she has yet to match her obvious inspiration in terms of cleverness and originality. Nowhere has that been more evident than in this movie. While I'm happy to see to see another studio follow in Fox's footsteps by making a R-rated superhero flick in this post-MCU market, the more mature and graphic content this allows for never feels as good a fit for Joker's ex as it did for Wolverine and the merc with a mouth. So all the F-bombs, gore, and raunchy humor end up coming off as sad attempts to be edgy more often than not. One of the more divisive aspects of 2016's Suicide Squad was it's Hot Topic visual aesthetic. It returns here and might actually be worse this time around. I really hope Warner Bros. ditches it going forward because I'm tired of the way it makes classic characters like Black Canary look ratchet. As much as I loved Jurnee Smollett-Bell in the role and want to see her return to it in a Green Arrow movie or something, her wardrobe was a consistent problem for me. With a few exceptions, the heroes and villains that have been unfortunate enough to find themselves in this corner of the DCEU have been subject to bad designs. Birds of Prey also lags behind other superhero films in the action department. It's hard to take Quinn herself seriously when her foes are clearly just standing there and letting her beat the crap out of them. Even when there are people onscreen who can believably carry a fight scene the choreography is usually sloppy. I wasn't expecting John Wick or anything, but this is well below the standards set by its peers. The story was the saving grace for me. There's no potential world ending threat here. It's just another messed up night in Gotham. Not only does this allow the adventure to stand out from the pack, but it also harkens back to the kind of material that got me into superheroes in the first place. Plus, it has the most memorable villains of any comic book adaptation to date in Black Mask and Victor Zsasz who actually benefit from all the gaudy flair. The script is a touch bloated (why is Huntress is even in this?), it makes no sense for Harley to have not been given top billing in the title, and much like David Ayer's critical misfire it all begs the question of where are the good guys? Specifically, where's Batman? This all going down in his city at night so it's hard to not wonder why he or some other member of the Bat-family didn't get involved at some point. For all of it's flaws though I loved the smaller, more intimate approach that was taken here. I think all of this just goes to show that if you're going to make a follow up to one of the entries in your cinematic universe, you might not want to pick the one that's arguably the worst of the bunch. You can take the most popular character from it and put them front and center, but if your still using so many of the same elements the results aren't going to be that much different. Then you have to add Harley Quinn's identity issues on top of that, as taking her content in a more hyperactive and harsher direction has betrayed so much of what made her interesting in the first place, as well as caused her to become more annoying than endearing. Something that, to the film's credit, is acknowledged multiple times by most of the people she comes in contact with. Overall, this isn't terrible, but it is a disappointing step back for the DCEU right as it had begun to redeem itself with its last few outings. 6.2/10","JUL 15, 2020",6,Crime

Sadly, other characters tend to be uninteresting, cheesy, or unpleasant. There is nothing more to them than the job they were given, thus they are neither appealing nor entertaining to watch. Even Mary Elizabeth Winstead's skill isn't effectively utilised by the directors. Despite some impressive manoeuvres, the fighting sequences may be improved.

This film breaks my heart as a DC comic book fan of the original and iconic Birds of Prey by Chuck Dixon. This is far removed far removed from the classic version that never should've been used in the first place. The characters, Huntress, Canary and most infuriating Cassandra Cain were do not resemble their comic book counterparts both in appearance and in character. The idea of this film being called birds of prey without even Barbara Gordon(Oracle) is a crime. They should've just called this film Harley Quinn or the Gotham City Sirens (with Poison Ivy) becasue 90 percent of the film wasn't about the team. All aside, the casting is decent(Margot Robbie can do no wrong as Harley Quinn), the usage of colour The use of colourswere great and I found some moments of entertainment through some of its action sequences hat mostly make no sense.However this film fails on lack of characterization, decent story, generic to boring and laughable villain(played greatly by Ewan Mcgregor),heesy acting from most of the cast, the apparent sexisim tone in this film and lack of motivation for the characters except fight the patriarchy.

It makes the characters into jarringly inconsistent crazy quilts - not in a good-crazy (joker) way but in a really poorly crafted (suicide squad) way. It forces Harley through a spaghetti press; shes a mass murdering psychopath but also a role model of the feminine independant from men. So she can kiIl some people with impunity but cant cross certain lines. She completely spares a police station by using non lethal force but switches back to bone breaking and murder on bikers. This could be cool if the charactrer was outlined and reinforced by this behavior but no good reason for it is given- which clarifies that the choices are being made for reasons outside the storyline and universe (for us, the viewers). Its not subtle. It even literally says the name of a real world politician she voted for. Harley Quinn (a mass murderer who abducts girls) votes for Bernie. Solid endorsement. You morons. To be clear: a good movie could be written about this character. . . This is just not it.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,"Dark, powerful, thrilling, emotional, and bittersweet, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is one of those films where it flaws are entirely evident through. With contrived action that only serves to prolong the tension of the gang destroying horcruxes, especially in the Room of Requirement, the film seems resistant to finally reaching its ending and overly reliant on this constant need for tension and action. Toss in the prolonged and similarly contrived moments in the bank, the manipulative nature of Harry seeing his dead parents, the visit from Dumbledore in the spirit world, the predictable restoration of Snape's name, the cheap way in which Snape is run off initially, the cheap death of Bellatrix, the easy way in which Voldemort is weakened through telling him the Elder Wand is not his, the cheesiness of the finale, and the horrible name Harry and Ginny gave their son, the concluding film in the Harry Potter series is objectively flawed. Yet, for every simpering second of this film, I loved it. It was everything I could have wanted and more. A thrilling and rousing conclusion to this tale, director David Yates is blessed with the opportunity to just get right into the story. With this ability to make a constantly thrilling work from beginning to end, Yates instantly makes this the best Harry Potter film as it is the only one without long sections dedicated to teenage angst. Sure, we see Neville run off to profess his love to Luna, but it is a throwaway line to break the tension more than anything. Otherwise, this is a Harry Potter film without bloat and excess, instead utilizing every moment to build up to the climax and using every film - hello Chamber of Secrets and Room of Requirement - in the progression of this film that also serves as some stellar, but subtle enough, fan service. After building up for seven films, it is tough to imagine this concluding film to truly match expectations as a thrilling and satisfying wrap-up, but with both the plot and characters, the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 more than satisfies. Having built to an incredible emotional climax, the film may be a bit manipulative, but it always feels authentic. As Harry sees him, Sirius, the wolf guy, and ignores his father, the scene is dripping with emotional authenticity. It is hard not begin choking up as he asks them to always be with him. Though rather low hanging fruit, Yates lends the scene great credibility with strong direction and writing. The writing never seems to be overwrought or melodramatic, but rather appropriately emotional and ringing with authenticity. In a similar vein, the Snape dream sequence is rather powerful even if a tad too long. A strong wrap-up for the character and a reveal of something that is likely obvious, but nonetheless nice to finally see come to the forefront. In retrospect, it also fills in some gaps with the character rather nicely, explaining much of Snape's treatment of Harry and why he was so demanding of the boy throughout. Similarly, giving context to the doe that guided Harry to the sword of Gryffindor is an emotionally resonant touch that is far more subtle, but incredibly powerful once you realize who it represented. As the concluding entry to a fantasy adventure series, the film's final bits of adventure as the gang track down horcruxes is appropriately rousing and thrilling at all times. With the clock ticking down, the film thrills and serves as an incredible mystery work as the kids track down where everything is and what the horcruxes could possibly be. Though, again, the final horcrux may be a bit obvious at this point, Yates handles it strongly and powerfully at all times, allowing the reveal and following scenes to resonate beautifully even if a tad obvious. Interestingly, it is hard to not see the reveal of the final horcrux and Harry's face-off with Voldemort as being used as a parallel to the crucifixion of Jesus. Intended to die to save the world, mocked by his enemies, killed, and then resurrected to defeat his greatest enemy, the parallels are obvious and further cement Harry as the savior of the wizarding world in the face of the absolute evil that wishes to plunge it into darkness. With its action set pieces, the final showdown between Harry and Voldemort is intense and often powerful, even if a bit cheesy at times. The blast of the red and green beams combining with one another as Harry slowly overpowers his foes is gorgeous to watch and a beautiful contrast to the drab gray surrounding them. The powerful face-off is one that may be a bit cheesy in execution, but tossed together with Voldemort breaking into a million pieces like the dead bride in Tim Burton's Corpse Bride is more than worth the wait. It is built up so strongly and with such anticipation over the course of seven films that it was hard to see how the film could ever live up to expectations.","SEP 17, 2017",9,Adventure

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,"Warning: Spoilers I have enjoyed all the films and love the books, and after how much I loved Deathly Hallows Part 1 this entry, continuing from exactly where the previous film left off, had a lot to live up to. It is less faithful to the mammoth but very interesting and wonderful book than its predecessor. However I found this, apart from one or two disjointed parts where you could tell that details had been left out and the arrival in Hogsmede and the duel between Mrs Weasley and Bellatrix seemed a little rushed, had more flow, was better paced and had more coherent storytelling and less of admiring the scenery than the previous entries. What stood out for me was not only the darkness of it, particularly the last thirty minutes or so which was a tad anti-climatic but very intense too and also Snape's death, but also the emotional impact. Gringotts(especially for the effects, the dragon being the standout), the moving Ressurrection stone sequence and Harry's final scene with Dumbedore were very well done, but my favourite was the Snape's memory sequence, which was beautifully done and quite poignant. Not only that, it's my favourite Harry Potter scene alongside the Three Brothers animated sequence and the Cave Scene. The 19 Years Later scene was quite affectionate as well, with the use of the original music and all. Once again, the production values are impeccable. The effects, apart from the odd ropey one in the Room of Requirement scene and Bellatrix's death, are excellent particularly at Gringotts, while the scenery and cinematography are magical with a touch of austerity too, and David Yates delivers his best directing job. There's also my favourite of Alexandre Desplat's scores, I loved his ones for Girl with a Pearl Earring and The King's Speech, the score was also one of the few good points about Twilight:New Moon and I found his score for the previous part very effective. What I loved though about this score was not just how beautiful, haunting and how incredibly melancholic it was, but also how much it enhanced the drama. The script is very good a vast majority of the time, doing a noble attempt to stick to the spirit of the book. The humour is less stilted and corny than I can find it to be, and when the tone is tense and poignant the writing does an above decent job reflecting that. The pacing is never dull, if deliberately less rushed(Goblet of Fire) or glacial(Deathly Hallows Part 1) as some of the other entries, and the storytelling is always interesting and compelling while never convoluted. The acting is very good. Rupert Grint is great as he consistently is, Emma Watson while not quite as good as she was in Deathly Hallows Part 1 gives one of her better performances of the series, Maggie Smith and John Hurt are always good value and while I didn't find him easy to warm to at first until Half-Blood Prince in his brief but relevant appearance Michael Gambon is also good. Helena Bonham-Carter, David Thewlis, Gary Oldman, Robbie Coltrane and Tom Felton while neither are at their best here bring a pleasing sheen to the film. Three actors in particular I found stood out and gave their best performances of the series. One is Daniel Radcliffe, at first I found him likable yet wooden with some questionable delivery, however overtime I think he's grown with more emotional range than usual. Two is Alan Rickman, while I have considered him one of the more consistent actors of this series him and the character of Snape really shine here, Rickman is especially good in the Snape's memory sequence. Three is Ralph Fiennes, I think it helps that like Snape Voldemort is given more scope here, that said Fiennes is appropriately sinister in the role and certainly looks the part. In conclusion, a wonderful film and for me the best of the series. And I still stand by my initial feeling that it was better filming the book as two movies, it would've have felt far too rushed as one. 9/10 Bethany Cox.","MAR 25, 2022",9,Adventure

Absolutely excellent ending of the saga.","SEP 8, 2020",8,Adventure
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,"I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, they're all so great and magical. But I didn't think the film series were perfect at all, but they were still great movies. With that, I was extremely excited to see the end of the film franchise, and impressed with the trailers. So I had high expectations. And thankfully it did not disappoint, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II, blew past my already high expectations and I was enthralled! The whole movie looked spectacular! The cinematography extremely well done, the art direction was incredible. The movie was beautiful to look at, the visuals were spectacular and truly Oscar worthy! The set designers, cinematographers really need to be awarded for their work, because it looks like they spend of time and money on the look of the film. The cast of the film was pretty much perfect, they should all be applauded too. Emma Watson, as usual is and great and she'll have a bright career ahead of her. Rupert Grint is pretty much great also, he is a fine actor indeed. Daniel Radcliffe did an amazing job and was very memorable as Harry Potter. Although I think Ralph Fiennes was the star of the film, he did unbelievable job as the evil, crazy Lord Voldemort, I think he deserves an Oscar Nomination for his role. The rest of the cast were also great too. We all grew up overtime with the series, we followed the adventures of Harry Potter for around 10 years, I think. It seems very weird that there will be no more Harry Potter films to look forward too. I will miss the franchise very much! However I am happy the series got an amazing ending. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II is not only the best film in the series, but it will probably be one of the best films of 2011. Everyone should see this film, even if they don't like past Harry Potter films.","NOV 9, 2020",10,Adventure

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,"The expected end. This film is the adaptation of the second half of the seventh and final book in the Harry Potter's saga, written by J.K. Rowling and directed by David Yates. This film is the end of a franchise that lasted more than seven years and earned billions. Yates excellently fulfilled its role but seems to have been a bit dazzled by the special effects. Certainly they have done a great service to the film, but it seems that, in the midst of so many effects and phenomenal camera angles, the script was a bit put away, eventually detaches from reporting the original book. One of the most surprising and unfortunate facts of this film is the radical change in the appearance of some parts of the castle, as its main entrance (which originally wasn't near the Great Hall) and the appearance of the stairs. Throughout the saga and all the books, the castle stairs had the same appearance and the ability to change position, which sometimes took the students to places where they wouldn't (or couldn't) go but, in this film, those so-known stairs gave way to some others, completely different, wider and imposing but that have nothing to do with descriptions of the castle in the books. Despite these negative details, the film is excellent. It's a real thriller in certain passages and has the gift of having the entire cast to give their maximum and achieving levels of interpretative excellence, giving to their characters an enormous depth, a human size, often fallible and imperfect. The final, moreover, it's surprising and absolutely breathtaking, as were also the last chapters of the book.","FEB 12, 2018",10,Adventure

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,"It's still riddled with the David Yates lack of urgency and lack of making things feel significant between characters, giving life and dynamic to the moment, and is lazy when conveying moments. There is a lifelessness to his directing, and only in transitions do you feel the wakeness after the slumber of execution you sit through. He isn't bad, he's just not a lively director. And for the last 3 films, it was felt incredibly. The movie has some powerful things in it, and I do believe is Yates' best outing yet. But as emotional as the resolve was, I didn't feel the impact, the heartfelt goodbye. Still is a good solid Potter movie that has some high stakes.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,"And the end came, and what an end. The first impression it gives you is that it is going to be aesthetically beautiful, and it does not fail throughout the film, every shot is eye-catching, everything is beautiful, a real joy. It also adds that it is action after action, freneticism after freneticism from minute one, how this accelerated pace was needed in some of the films in the saga, how cool. It overflows with epicness everywhere, it makes your hair stand on end at some moments, sometimes it even makes you want to cry, you are finishing a saga of 8 films, and David Yates knows it, and he wants you to feel that part of homesickness when finishing the saga . By the way, how good the soundtrack is, the mother who gave birth to me, how good she is, Desplat is a true genius, and I would even dare to say that he surpasses John Williams. AND THE scene? What can you tell me about THE scene? Hogwarts, in its true splendor, how wonderful my god. One of the best scenes in the saga without a doubt. As I said, the action scenes, the overwhelming pace, the soundtrack, the photography, and above all the cast, wow what a cast, as you can see the maturity, makes this film totally wonderful as the end of one of the most mythical sagas. . Something bad, to say the least, perhaps there is little depth in the characters, they make each one have their time on screen, but perhaps I lack development or depth in some characters that surely happens in the books.","JAN 10, 2021",8,Adventure

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,"Coming from a non-harry potter fan, this was a decent film and a suitable finish to a series that spans an entire decade. It acts well as the climatic third act to the slow-burning, exposition-filled set up, of the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. Its a well paced, action packed adventure with dazzling visual effects (possibly the best visual effects of all the harry potter films) and a deft sound mix. It also excels artistically with the usual good performance from all our stars and a brisk screenplay that narrates the bombastic plotline with relative ease. Being the finale, it would have been pleasing if a bit more screen time was given to many of our secondary characters and most of all, a lengthier epilogue would have given it a better conclusion. This definitely won't go down as a classic, but it does well at wrapping up a memorable collection films.","JUL 31, 2011",6,Adventure

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,"I am fan of the HP books, and went with great expectations to see this movie, Sadly I went out very dissapointed. It was a very superficial, flat vision of the book. The scene with Harry and LV and the end was just created to show up the 3D effects. The most important thing, the core of the whole story the death of LV was incomprehensible and lack of the rich nuances of the book. Other scenes, like the moments before the death of Snape with Nagini on the floor instead of the sphere of the book for example took away the magic details of the magic world and focus on the butchery of regular action movies. I agree with the person who points that David Yates doing have moved the movies away from the **** only satisfaction I got was seeing such an impeccable cast working together.","JUL 16, 2011",4,Adventure
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,"The Deathly Hallows Part 1 was a great movie in my opinion, certainly one of the best in the series, it was full of great scenes, mostly because it was taken faithfully from the book. However in splitting the book into two films, they had to squeeze about 10 chapters into a full length movie. This led to a need to grossly diverge many of the locations and events from the actual book, and a lot of important elements were missed out, as well as unwanted ones added. It's such a shame when they have to resort to Cliches such as Harry and Voldermort both crawling broken towards their wands like some sort of action thriller, and I don't remember the bit in the book where Harry and Voldermort jump struggling off a cliff. Other minor details annoy me as well, for example one of Malfoys 'henchman' was replaced by a black student in the room of requirement scene where Harry is finding the diodem. I mean, is racial equality that bad that every scene now needs to have an even distribution, so much so that they change a scene from the book (Crabbe dieing, or was it Goyle, I'm not too sure. Instead now some random character they invented dieing.) Also instead of killing Snape in the Shrieking Shack they decided to move that absolutely classic scene into the Hogwarts boathouse, which just felt another unneeded cliche to make it look slightly more epic. Don't get me wrong though, the movie was entertaining enough, but way more of the same. We've already seen the epic Red vs Green wand clash about twice in the series now, and it happened again, multiple times in the film. But at least they managed to make Voldemorts death look slightly less climactic and sudden as it was in the book. So to summarise, I found the film to be one of the weakest in the series, even if it was alright. Nothing really new was seen, despite it being the conclusion to an epic saga. Due to the decision to stretch the book into two films, Part 2 came seriously lacking in my opinion, and some people I've spoken to even found it to be a slog. But, if you are a Harry Potter fan or not I'd reccommend at least going to see the film. In fact if you are not a fan of the books you'll probably enjoy it even more.","JUL 17, 2011",5,Adventure
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,"I found this to be a fitting if somewhat underwhelming end to the most repetitively episodic and stiffly acted of franchises (not counting the recent Star Wars trilogy movies BECAUSE THEY DID NOT HAPPEN, THEY F$%^ING DID NOT HAPPEN OKAY?! Ahem....) Director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves do exactly what they have done with previous installments; which is to move the film along as fast as possible whilst using as little expositional dialogue as possible and simultaneously dumping anything from the books that had any real character deepening qualities, ( Dumbledores dark past is completely sidestepped) or emotional clout, and leaving it cruelly flapping on the cutting room floor like a confused, suffocating trout. The battle of Hogwarts looks, well... pretty crappy, with Yates attempting to ape shots from Lord of the Rings and failing, despite having a much bigger budget to work ****! SAY WHAT?! Uh Huh! No **** Anyway, I can't be bothered writing anymore about this movie as it doesn't deserve it. Piss off Harry Potter, seriously. Yeah okay the books are fun and the movies are WHATEVER but does this crap really deserve to be the overwhelming super fart franchise it has become? NO! So much is better than this: looking at a wall for example, certainly a more wholesome experience than being forced to sit through either of the first two movies. Scratching your eye, easily as much fun as watching Harry Potter 5, fa show! Funny story: I actually farted earlier and it reminded me of Daniel Radcliffe's acting when R-Pattz died in HP Sause 4, what a stinkyness that was, jeez, in fact pretty much anytime Radcliffe had to really emote in a scene he failed miserably, though he did get less crap, but in the end he was still crap. and he knows it. The other two actor-children-people-things? Crap. Oh! Pushing a granny down the stairs, that's probably more fun than all the movies combined actually, and that's free to do, and only takes a second, AND you don't have to sit through twenty odd hours of crappy child actors pretending to actually like the crappy movie they're acting in yet all the while being glad they are who they are, not just because they're richer than most of us, but because they don't have to be us and not be in Harry Potter like we aren't, and have to pretend to everyone else that they like the movies everyone else likes such as Harry Potter, which thay actually think is only okay and not the second coming and would probably rather go down to the park and do an outdoor activity if you asked them, or even just do something else, like say....waterboarding themselves! Transformers is crap too, and loads of other stuff and whichever the latest tight wearing super ninny movie about a dude who got some powers through no fault of his own but was then able to pooh through peoples minds and travel back in time and become his own anus or his planet would explode or whatever even though he a bit socially awkward cause of their differences just like all of us are, awww, is. IRON CAPTAIN THOR FARTS 4: The secrets of the Teenage Mutant Ninja prostitutes! Its all the same! HuuuuuP! I actually am a Harry Potter fan, believe it or not, but I think this previous 'stream of consciousness' shows just how apathetic I was towards this movie and it got me thinking about whether artistic movie tastes are perhaps cyclical and.....well I don't know, originality might become fashionable again, probably not though so....

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,"These are not my own words - they are an assorted collection from the pens of the critics who dared to disagree with the vast majority of sheeple who believe that anything related to Harry freakin' Potter is holy: 'Gloomy imagery, the series' only consistency has been its lack of excitement and ineffective use of special effects all to make magic unmagical and to make action seem inert.' It is 'unfocused, supernatural-themed sludge.' 'Director David Yates moves at only two speeds: Super-charged yet not impactful and laboured and faux-majestic stillness. He constantly misjudges moments by underplaying events that should be cool, like jumping off of a dragon.' Not to mention the missed details in the books. I'm not saying that you could fit eveything IN, but I'm sure if Yates tightened up the sloow, soap opera style lifetime tv movie (which incidentally, was the whole of his career before Potter) Harry Potter since the Order of the Phoenix wouldn't be these 'dreary [slogs]' of movies.","JUL 15, 2011",5,Adventure
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,"Here's the thing: reviews from all the major critics are unfailingly unhelpful, and I'm always left wondering what movie they saw that I didn't, usually when, as here, they just love the film. The Potter finale is not bad, by any means. Nor am I concerned that it takes liberties with the books. The problem is that, as a rousing finale, it is lacking, chiefly because the pace is all wrong. We've been set up for 11 years for the momentum that must carry this film, and it's all stops and starts. Not good. Then, and also irrespective of Rowling's story, I was deeply disturbed by Voldemort's weak agenda. Haven't we been led to anticipate that, in full power, he is going to consume the world? So - why is he so triumphant at the Hogwarts scene, as though the school were his ultimate goal? The Voldemort I've been expecting would not bother making a recruitment speech to the kids. They join or die, period, and he's too flimsy here to be truly scary. On the plus side: Rickman is fabulous. Radcliffe is better than he ever was. AT LAST, Maggie Smith gets to strut her stuff. That makes it worth it. But...this was not a truly successful film conclusion to the saga. And, to be rather **** I so wanted a bit more oomph when Mrs. Weasley takes out Bellatrix.

I thought, after seeing the previews, these people in Hollywood were finally making 3-D look good! But they aren't there wasn't enough 3-D in Harry. + Can't they make freaking lens free I-Max 3-D glasses!!? 2. Next this was ""setty""! I hate ""setty"" movies! What I mean by ""setty"" is that during one scene there are all these people around and watching a fight go **** two things go **** it's kinda stupid and feels like you're on a set when this kinda thing takes **** it get's worst when the characters all run away and go fight in there own little **** was kinda **** like a big scene get's set up...than woosh (well not really they walked haha) they're in the castle fighting... 3. The fight scenes **** (see last point). There was not enough blood (for a finally), and when many characters got hurt or died you didn't see anything. CHEAP. 4. The film was very dry and boring at first. The opening scene was almost like a really bad reality show...where there were pauses and script stumble and lots of awkward silence. 5. Plot **** many other reviewers point **** one that bothered me was a character from the beginning disappeared and ended up at a place Harry didn't know **** was so stupid it was like why wouldn't she just tell him she was going there. Such a dumb plot hole. 6. There was no Dobby, and too little Rubeus. When Rubeus was used his scene was cheap and quick. I would have liked to see him kick some goblins in the face! I felt like they are saving Dobby for the next series (in conjuction with the ending, see next point). I felt like I was cheated. Everyone should show up in the finale, and show up in style. 7. The **** my gosh the ending was so bad....I can't believe they didn't save that for the blu-ray extras. I felt like this was a SCAM and that they were just trying to set up the next Harry Potter franchise! Yuck. Great way to ruin a movie! 8. The dragon!!! Come on it's an awesome dragon! This is fantasy land! Do more with the dragon! Hey how about some 3-D flying angles?!??!! 9. There weren't enough fantasy creatures, and unique special effects that made the first couple movies within a unique world..this felt like it was cold and old. 10.

I could go on and list everything the film failed to include but it would be better to just go and re-read the books as the films, especially this one, don't do them justice.","JUL 16, 2011",4,Adventure
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,"Ultimately disappointing. The biggest problem with the conclusion of this franchise is that Harry so unflappably walks the path of good that his victory over Voldemort not only feels inevitable, but hollow. What made The Return of the King - another fantasy epic - such a great conclusion was Frodo continuously succumbing to evil. While in that we knew good would triumph, it was such a struggle to get there. This, and the previous film were both diluted by its over-reliance on effects, hollow uninteresting battle scenes, hammy dialogue - lines such as ""I've always wanted to use that spell"", and the poorly delivered ""Yeah? You and who's army?"" and nothing in the way of much of a story. At no time did it feel as if our heroes were in any danger or placed in impossible situations.","MAY 11, 2012",5,Adventure

And I'm one of those people who wouldn't mind no real plot, but the acting I've seen better. I personally think Narnia: Voyage of the Dawn Treader was much more entertaining, and visually better. Plus it had more 'Magic' if you get what Im saying, even without there full cast. Percy Jackson I believe and I actually read all the Percy Jackson books, they made a better movie. Whats wrong with Harry Potter, the acting is less then good. Why do critics praise these movies, Im almost 95% sure non of them have even picked up the book.

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,"There are two reasons to watch the final installation of the Harry Potter movies: the Battle of Hogwarts and the final duel between Harry and Voldemort. The battle was alright. I expected more, thought they'd come up with some really innovative effects or cinematography, but it was pretty good regardless. The reason I give the Deathly Hallows Pt. 2 such a low score is because it absolutely RUINED the Harry-Voldemort duel. In the book, this scene derives all its drama from the fact that it happens in front of a packed Great Hall, where all eyes are on the two main characters fighting for their lives. Not so in the movie. Also, what was with Voldemort crumbling away like a vampire exposed to sunlight? It's so important that he die like a normal human, to illustrate the point that he *wasn't* some kind of god-like evil force, but just an evil man. This film screwed that up, too. Bad, bad, bad.","AUG 11, 2011",3,Adventure
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,"Can you say ""expectation greater than realization""? Everything is there from a great story of intrigue, danger, love, hate, friendship, families,betrayal, life and death. Then add some of the greatest stage and screen actors around. All this should have been fodder enough for the most thrilling roller-coaster ride of the Harry Potter series of movies EVER! But what did we get? A movie that was as yawning and emotionally void as a teaspoon. Sure, the pyrotechnics and special effects were A+ but what happened to the roller coaster of emotion and tension, happiness of reunited families then sudden death and unhappiness? Percy's reunion with his family to join the fight would have been well worth an added five minutes to the length of the movie. Here is the up ride of the coaster in one second to joy, happiness and forgiveness and as suddenly as Percy is back, Fred is killed! Down goes the roller coaster screaming to despair, out come the tears horizontally! Another great scene that went missing was MacGonagall giving Slughorn the basic ""grow some **** and fight or get out of the way"". A simple rousing speech by her, at this point, to rally the troops to fight would have had the audience cheering and the students' blood boiling to save their beloved Hogwarts! But no, the fight begins with a ""send Slytherin to the dungeons!'. Seriously, that was no battle cry! Once the battle started, there were few students and others to be seen actually fighting. The movie could have added another five minutes to focus in on a fight here or a death there. Even the great battle from the book (many were waiting to hear the 'B"" word) between Molly Weasley and Bellatrix Lestrange would have sent the coaster car careening up to the top of the ride before crashing down with Bellatrix's death (which by the way was more of a whimper than the fabulous death scene it could have been - slow motion added here would have further crossed the T on her death!). A few other things could have greatly enhanced this movie: Voldemort actually dying in front of the whole school, Hagrid and Grawp fighting outside the castle and then Hagrid getting carried away by the spiders, and Neville and others carrying dead students back to the Great Hall. Just some simple touches of what made the book great would have made this movie stellar. Yes, the scene with Snape's tears going into the vial then into the panseive was fabulous. I sobbed when he held Lily and thought my heart would break at this truly touching and fabulously added scene. Added scenes would have had the audience on the edge of their seats one moment and blubbering into their popcorn the next. Making this picture longer and not jumping so quickly from scene to scene would have allowed the audience to savor this this truly final film in this fabulous series. What's wrong with a three hour movie for 30 million plus fans? Either the WB was looking at the bottom line or those in charge of production were tired and looking at their watches. Finally, the last scene with Harry and company sending their children off to Hogwarts 19 years later. The music as lovely and teary, but what happened to Ron being funny or Harry being stared at? More lost opportunity. And the roller coast limps to the end of the ride. So sorry, but this could have been the big, giant ""O"" in the HP series and I am very sad it did not live up to the wonderful book and my high expectations.","JUL 21, 2011",0,Adventure

Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,"Warning: Starts a bit ****, deeper critiques later on.. Coming from a book reader standpoint: completely insulting. The end ""battle"" between Voldemort and Harry felt like a slap in the face. Why did it have to have a battle. The whole point the book tries to make is Harry never attacks Voldemort, and never outright kills him. (In the books) Their very tense last conversation as they circle each other down to the ray of light cutting across the sky was absolutely breathtaking to read. Whereas in the film, they have a full minute hugathon battle across Hogwarts and climaxed in a game of ""Just the Tip"" with their wands. Other things that bugged me: cartooning Bellatrix's death was just silly. The movie canon never mentioned Lupin and Tonks ever having a child so why did the act like he did at the end? It must of confused non-book readers, same goes for Sirius' mirror shard. Fred's death off-screen (its on screen in the book). Why do all the minor actors in this series like Xenophilius Lovegood (HPDH part 1) and the actress who plays The Grey Lady have to shout out suddenly and randomly in order to convey emotions, it's almost like the creators felt as though the audience would be too unintelligent to figure out what emotion the actors are feeling or the actors were not good at their parts. And finally simply breaking the UNBEATABLE wand in half like it is really just a twig. I would have liked to give it a better score than a 3 but this movie left me feeling really dead inside, and not because the series was over. I cannot even read the books anymore, which saddens me greatly. And if a movie can have that kind of negative effect on my life, I feel I have to give it what I give it. I know many love it, even the book readers. There are good some things I have to give them props for being topnotch (visual effect and minor things) with its huge budget and all that keep it from a 1 which is what I want to give it Non-book readers no doubt found it spectacular, but I can't, in good conscience, give it a better score. The books had been an vast part of my life since I was eight (1999), and the film completely broke me for awhile and there is nothing more that I can say than that.","JUL 13, 2013",3,Adventure
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2,"I sometimes wonder what this movie franchise would be like if the books didnt exist. Personally i think the franchise would have extremely low box office scores. A majority of the fanbase are young teens who are obsessed with the books and who have very bad taste in movies. With having said that this movie is clearly just a pop phenomenon which includes horrendous acting, poor screenplay, and terrible directing. David Yates seems to only high-lite the action sequences and skips through the dialogue and story telling. I really dont know where Yates got the idea of changing the film to action flik. I always associated the books with action/adventure or myster/Adventure. Clearly leanign toward and adventure. And i dont feel like the movies represent an adventure, rather a trio of teenage wizards who seem to always know what to do. There is absolutely no build up to anything they do. For example: ""Hey, we need to break into Gringots bank"" (the most difficult bank to break into and considered impossible) ""OKay, well give me the sword and i will help you"" (Scene cuts) Hermione suddenly changes into Bellatrix and Ron has make up on? I would be utterly confused if i hadnt read the book. The movie fails to explain anything that the trio does. Cut back to part 1 of dh7. ""Hey! we need to break into the ministry"" (keep in mind that Harry is the most wanted person in Britiain) ""Okay"" cut scene, the 3 are outside in london knocking out 3 random people who could be normal muggles. but miraculously they happen to be wizards! I mean for godsakes David Yates, build up the **** scenes before jumping into them.

But I know for a fact that the movie doesn't *need* to be like the book.. I loved the movie but honestly, I disliked the liberties the movie has taken with the original story. I still can't believe he broke the wand. He doesn't drop the stone himself, he trips and drops it. There have been lots of places the movies have been different from the book. Most places, I defended it because you put everything in a movie. Case in point was Harry getting the new broom in HP: PoA. Sure, you can't explain the entire story the same way so the broom was given at the end of the movie. The battle at Hogwarts however deserved more. People have been waiting a long time for it. The number of liberties taken are too much. As a movie, I'd probably give it a strong 8/10 for a good visual treat and a nice ending to a saga we've been long awaiting. As a movie which is an end to a saga which was long awaited, the clear butchering of the book's version into the director's/writer's version of the story is just too much for me to handle. I thought the seventh movie was split in two to avoid this exact scenario. For this reason, I'd give it a 1.5/10. In the end, I'll stick to something in between.","SEP 10, 2011",3,Adventure

But in this movie the final confrontation between Harry and Voldermort was built up soooooo much that what took over 8 films to hype us up for the final battle ended in mere minutes 3/4 of the way through the film. Thus leaving me VERY dissatisfied already I figured ""well I am watching it now, might as well see it through"" , the thing I hated yet LOVED about the Lord Of The Rings movies was even though the films had a long running time it TOOK that time and explained everything in detail and had you leaving the cinema adventure satisfied. Harry Potter on the other hand takes less than 5-10mins to explain what the after events of the Deathly Hallows is and I felt ripped off as an adventure fan, hell even my inner child was raging inside of me of the end result.

While Moon and Gravity succeeded with effectively a single player (sorry George) The Martian adds another storyline which includes NASA and Damon's crew - now on a mission at an impossible distance from where Damon resides.

Although Matt Damon shares more screen time than Tom Hanks did, The Martian is very much Castaway in space with much of the movies focus on Watney’s attempts to survive against all the odds.

Of course, the film abuses archetypes a little, especially in the character of Donald Glover, who I believe is there just for visibility, but anyway, the rhythm is phenomenal, proposing several comical, discovery and even tense scenes, which made me stop being a bit annoying this time. The atmosphere on Mars is very good. It could be more immersive, in terms of heat and emptiness, but perhaps it would deviate a little from the purpose, which is to have fun, and in that it works very well - I, at least, laughed a lot. Anyway, the photography takes great advantage of the warm tone in the desert and with a cleaner color palette in the ""base"" or in the ship, which gives a great contrast between conditions. Some open plans are true paintings and HDR adds a lot to this work. The OST is present at different moments and gives the weight that the moment needs. The soundtrack, according to my musical taste, couldn't be better, with classic songs that simply cheer us up just by listening to them. The Martian is fun, intelligent, has a great cast, and even though it pushes one stereotype or another, it works very well as a whole. Audio: English, with Portuguese subtitles.

The Martian,"This is a science fiction and adventure drama film, with themes covered including exploration, peril, hope and mutiny. Its fairly slow paced (understandably so, I thought), with some good visual effects - I imagine this would have been quite impressive if viewed at the cinema - it certainly looked impressive on my smaller TV screen. It is fairly immersive and thus atmospheric as well. I liked how the viewer sees things from time to time from the in-built space capsule's camera, as if viewing his activities from a cold and scientific type of viewpoint. Some of the music used is pretty space-y, new age style at times, while other music tracks are very much retro disco in style (believe it or not). That aside, the film definitely has quite a futuristic feel - you could argue that the selfish element of the plot is sadly reminiscent of current society, given how much emphasis people often put on themselves (often, not always of course). I thought it did have a surprisingly uplifting element to itself and its fair to say that the fragility of humanity, of life and so on is quite well put across. There are also quite sobre aspects of the plots, possibly not the ones you may expect, I wouldn't want to provide spoilers but lets say that sadly too much emphasis is put on public relations. I'd go so far as to say its somewhat thought provoking. Cast wise, Matt Damon plays Mark Watney, the astronaut aka 'man left behind'. He comes across as very knowledgable and with a quite scientific mind but also headstrong and determined to do all he can to increase his chances of being re-discovered. I found myself feeling quite sorry for him, for obvious reasons and hoping for a good outcome. Other members of his team include Melissa Lewis, played by Jessica Chastain, Annie Montrose played by Kristen Wiig. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Vincent Kapoor, who works for NASA as the director of the mission Mark is involved in, while Sean Bean plays Mitch Henderson and Jeff Daniels plays Teddy Sanders, NASA's Chief Director. The cast played their roles well - I thought it was well cast. Content wise, there are some instances of mild innuendo's and mild to moderate profanities and there are some ocassional scenes featuring injuries, with a bit of blood shown but no very graphic detail present. Some scenes obviously feature an element of peril and threat, which younger viewers (predominantly children) may find somewhat frightening or disturbing but otherwise there's nothing obviously likely to disturb or upset people. Due to this content, the film has been given a 12 rating. Normally I'm not very keen on sci-fi type films, especially if its predominantly set in space but I found this surprisingly watchable as I was curious to see what the ultimate outcome would be for Mark. It definitely does have somewhat a sterile feel to it but I felt it worked in its favour somehow. Oh yes and of course a certain Mr Bowie does also feature in the soundtrack, although perhaps not quite the song you might expect. Yes I would recommend this film as I felt Matt Damon did well in portraying an interesting character and while the plot is far from entirely original, I felt it featured decent visual effects and it did well at portraying humanity, the fragility of it in a somewhat sterile setting or way. Its hard to explain precisely but I found it surprisingly watchable and quite engrossing and I suppose it is potentially quite thought provoking, so I'd recommend it on that basis.","NOV 23, 2021",7,Adventure
The Martian,"The Martian benefits from being the product of Andy Weir's truly excellent novel, which in itself was the product of years of research to ensure the story was as scientifically plausible as possible. That really shows in the movie, as believable problems continue to arise and the creativity of people works to come up with solutions to the situation of how to safely bring home a single man stranded on Mars with scant resources. Easily one of the best Ridley Scott movies, this movie delivers a beautiful blend of wonderful Mars vistas and an excellent score, with lots of humour from the main character, Mark Watney, who is ideally played by Matt Damon with a stoic continuous sense of humour throughout the challenges as he breaks the wall and talks to the audience throughout in the for of video diary entries. Gripping, lots of really excellent supporting cast with developed characters. I have found myself coming back to re-watch The Martian countless times in the years since its release. I think that's because the story is uplifting and positive, combined with an inspirational glimpse into the potential near future of Mankind as we step forward to becoming a multi-planetary species. If you love a good sci-fi movie, look no further than The Martian, it's in the top 5 of the last decade in my opinion, and crafted by a legendary director.","MAR 1, 2021",9,Adventure
The Martian,"Scifi with some laughs and a heart for a change. Avoids the pretentious self-importance of many recent scifi films like Interstellar. A good story and well directed, with a really upbeat and inspiring end credits sequence set to ""Love Train"", which wraps it up on a high note, shows us all the characters again, and leaves us with a good vibe - one of the best end sequences in cinema imho. Points for daring to lay in 70s disco and 80s pop as the main soundtrack - helps to keep a light mood and avoid the dreaded heavy pretentious quality of so much sci fi. Points off for some very thin and weak science that breaks credibility several times -- esp. during the final pickup when he magically flies around like Iron Man using just a little whiff of escaping air from his spacesuit. Come on! The screenwriter ran out of ideas at 3 AM. This is where the director has to step in and take control -- find a better way. Watney misses his big moment when he finally gets a chance to send a message back to Earth. He should have sent, ""SEND - EARTH - WOMEN"" -- cut to the next scene, mission control telling him they got 172,000 volunteers.","SEP 25, 2019",8,Adventure

The Martian is not about far future and distant planets, it describes a fairly realistic situation in the near future, after mankind finally landed on Mars. This is probably the most realistic sci-fi film I've ever watched, since is based on a book by the same name, written by Andy Weir, who studied for a long time to make it as realistic as possibile.

The Martian,"The Martian You rated this movie: 3.0 Rate 5 stars Rate 4 stars Rate 3 stars Rate 2 stars Rate 1 star . ""The Martian"" was decent. The problem? it was too predictable. There was never a time when I didn't guess what was about to happen. There was no real suspense. Matt Damon's performance was good (but not Oscar worthy), The screenplay was decent (but a little too science conscious). And the direction by one of cinema's all-time great directors, Ripley Scott, was by-the-numbers efficient. Yet, there was not a realistic feel to it all. The players seemed like actors rather than real people. Did any members of the crew fall in love? Did Damon ever get mentally crazed, being alone, with little to do, for so long? Were there protesters among the people, who might have felt that the billions of dollars spent to save one life could have been used to benefit thousands of lives?

The Martian,"I had high expectations going to this movie, but was surprised to be disappointed already 3 minutes into the beginning of this (overrated) movie. As some others did over here I'll gladly display some of my thoughts on either Pro's and Con's. Pro's: - Matt Damon - although his character was pretty bland in my book, Damon seems enjoyable to watch most of the times. - Science - from the many enthusiastic friends who watched this movie, many comments were about the science behind it. ""Everything's made to be just right"". And I agree this takes more than just a lousy story maker, it's nice to know what boundaries a movie is limited to and why. Same principle's for the Mars landscape, which is actually placed in Jordania. But there's really more negative points, I've experienced, watching this movie. Con's: - Story: the story could actually be alright , although it's badly performed. Little suspense is created by changing from different perspectives (Earth, Mars, some-where in between) so that the viewer already knows what's going on before disaster will strike. In contrary to others who watched 'The Martian', I genuinely believed Mark would die whilst making the leap for a safe return. But either way, doomed or ready to re-live, there's little on the way to an outcome that will make you consider changing thoughts. O yes, Mark's little garden explodes (although it happens within a minute after someone from Earth questions whether he will make it without any setbacks). And he overcomes them with so much ease it seems, because the next moment we're 7 months ahead and he just lost some weight but is still in perfect mental (and physical) condition. And why is it we see him eat during most of his conversations with himself/the webcam? And what's up with all 'political' bull**** happening on Earth? This movie is supposed to be about surviving Mars, not surviving boring conversations of people in nice suits. And why is the geeky girl who 'controls' the satellites in so many of the scenes on Earth, while an eccentric kid who just thought of a excellent way to get back to Mars faster is shoved off the podium. So little is gained from 'experiencing' all the hustle on Earth, and although it's nice to see for once China is involved in all of it, what point does it prove except for a second multi trillion dollar chance to free a human from Mars. - During his long, long stay on a deserted planet, with ravish winds keeping you from sleep and the immediate danger (as explained) when some of your little eco-system just shuts down, Mark Watney is just another heroic optimist with lack of any character development. From the beginning of the movie, where there's a (not-so) funny conversation to set the relationship between the characters, until 3 months later, they just start where they left off: with 'jokes' and all, to saturate the general public. Even on the moment of reunion, little tears are shed. I want to see more frustration and anger, more joy with little things conquered. More 'Mark Watney' screen time would be a step in the right direction. Instead of just stating he wants to go home, give him a really good reason to do so, and make him viable in our minds. Anyway, there's plenty more from where this came from. It's just so upsetting this movie has so many errors in it to be enjoyably.","DEC 25, 2015",5,Adventure

The Martian,"Honestly this wasn't terrible it just fell flat. The acting was pretty flat, the soundtrack was very flat. I feel like someone told the actors that all scientists and engineers are typically emotionless human beings. All of the NASA interactions in the first half of the moving are just not engaging. It does pick up in second half and overall I would have been happier with the movie except for the nonsensical end. The Good: Overall the movie was smartly adapted from the book. I think all of the sections removed were smart decisions that would have taken forever to narrate and been really hard to depict. Matt Damon did well. Kristen Wiig did a good job with her character, wish she could have had a little more time. The Bad: The acting and actors. I don't think Chastain was a great pick for Commander Lewis. I would have liked to see someone a bit more hard edged. It seems like Vogel is only German so that he can say Mein Gott instead of My God at one point. I'm not sure if Jeff Daniels was actually awake. The Ugly: The point where Hermes crew finds out Watney's still alive is a huge up of celebration and then a huge down of Lewis admitting she left him behind, and I didn't get any of that at all from the scene. It just went straight to Lewis being down. That was a failure of acting and directing. Vincent Kapoor instead of Venkat: The long winded explanation of father religion and mother religion then the punchline, which seemed almost whispered, was far less effective than just having the character being Hindu. Donald Glover as Danny Pudi's Abed as Rich Purnell. The final scene. Wow was that dumb. Matt Damon leaps from a spinning capsule after cutting a hole in his suit he can't control. You can see the thrust going all over the place (like Lewis said it would) and yet he surprisingly stays right on course. And then of course the hole seals up when it's no longer important and no one seems worried that all of his air is venting to space. It just flies in the face of a novel that was compelling because it was accurate. And they didn't have any dumb departures from reality like this the whole movie, then to do it at the end, when it wasn't even necessary or that engaging? Overall it was entertaining. I wouldn't watch it again.","OCT 12, 2015",5,Adventure

Other mars movies were better at engaging audience. Very well produced in terms of the main character trying to survive and levereging resources around him on the planet. Attention to detail in creating the survival capsules , rover and instrumentation.

The movie was simply a two dimensional wise crack that would be most suitable for high school students or the developing world. I was bored after about 15 minutes when i knew exactly how it would end though perhaps not the exact incredibly miraculous method to save out protagonist. The movie really reminds me of the show, Dirtiest Job, which is about the highest degree of mental and emotional level your are placed in with this thing.

The Martian,"Time for the dreaded ""mixed review"" I'll say right now - if you love space movies, Mars, science, astrophysics, NASA, or anything related to these things, this movie will become your new favorite. There's not a doubt in my mind. It very sincerely pushes the boundaries of what films have explained of astronomical science. It does what other movies have not in this regard, I'll absolutely give it that. As for me, science was my worst subject, so a lot of the impressiveness this movie simply must contain goes right over my head. And yes, I do understand it on the same level I understand a movie like Interstellar, except even more because the physics and the ""botany"" and such is explained on a very personable level. However, it doesn't work for the same reasons Interstellar might not work. The entire movie is an _estimation_ of how you could go about a Mars rescue. That is why people go to see it. As a result, there's not much else keeping the movie going except constant scientific explanation. I was definitely expecting something a lot more thrilling going into ""The Martian"", a movie where you have to **** rescue Matt Damon from Mars' deathly atmosphere from thousands of miles away in space. Maybe I'll stick with some other film in that regard, because this one doesn't cut it at all. The tone of the film is a dead giveaway – Matt Damon will come home safe and that the movie will stretch its own boundaries and possibilities just to make that happen. And I won't give away a big twist in the middle of the movie that makes you doubt it, but in retrospect, even that wasn't good enough to fool me. It was never a matter of ""if"" Matt Damon was gonna come home, it was a matter of when and how. The how was pretty interesting, the when was incredibly tedious. Another reason why you might love this movie is that there's lots of character development – IF YOU'RE A SCIENCE GEEK. As for me, I don't get the characters at all. Matt Damon is supposed to be some kind of hardcore, pushing-the-limits scientist. The other scientists have a billion inside jokes with each other that are completely dumb, but it's supposed to be in an ""aww, their relationships with each other are so adorable"" kind of way. It doesn't work for me at all. I know and knew many young people who are into science and are in Harvard and UF and other schools studying this stuff right now. I know they will love this movie because it's custom-tailored to someone who thinks about the stuff the movie talks about all the time. It's for the Neil DeGrasse Tyson generation. It is not for anyone else, as far as I can tell. I did not really enjoy it. There are movies like it already in existence that are better at what they do in every area but the science. One more thing: If you think the People's Republic of China's government would actually share a secret with the United States to save one person, you clearly don't know Chinese history. That's probably the most disappointing deus ex machina in film history Reagan0 out.","OCT 12, 2015",5,Adventure

The script seems written more by market researchers than a screenwriter. The pacing is not good. Film slows down at many points and is unnessarily stretched. It could have been shorter, it didn't deserve 2hr 30min runtime. Matt Demon's performance and special effects were good. Only, these two things were good in the whole movie.

Maybe that’s the way the author wanted the story to be and he focused on transmitting the despair and hopelessness of the protagonist; but the movie fails at it, there are only a bunch of explosion making a cheap melodrama, where everything goes unbelievably wrong, seeming one of those hidden camera jokes. So basically Ridley Scott ruined this story, the screenplay is not very clever, the music is simple and the acting of Matt Damon is awful, he is incapable of involving the audience with what is like to be trapped in outer space, and he is basically the pillar supporting the whole thing, which transforms all the effort of the author in a lame space movie among many, that will soon be forgotten.","JAN 25, 2016",4,Adventure

Sure, effects were nice, but that's just a matter of money rather than cinematographic skill. Still better than Gravity, though, because at least it doesn't try to take itself too seriously.

The characters had ZERO FLAWS and EVERYONE was unrealistically selfless and compassionate. The producers grossly embellished the compassion of humankind to the degree of a fairy tale. For example, the astronauts all agree to extend their mission in space by OVER 500 DAYS while understanding it is unlikely they will succeed - or even make it back alive. Yet they all agree to sign up for this greater good without even 60 seconds hesitation. (Yeah, okay, and nobody ever thinks of themselves, right? Not to mention their families and responsibilities back home). YEAH RIGHT... One character receives flak for this decision from his wife who, over a Facetime conversation, while holding their small child, expresses her disapproval. Yet when the astronaut holds up a little toy for the child to see, the child smiles and all is right with the world... COME ON. I also find it hard to believe the Chinese government would spend billions of dollars and declassify their space technology to help save the life of an AMERICAN astronaut. (You see how they treat their own people lately?). I'll do Hollywood a favor and make it more realistic by believing the PRC is only doing it for bargaining power at the next United Nations Security Council conference. You know, like political currency. I understand though, Hollywood, this is a nice feel-good movie with a happy ending. Moreover, the movie was over an hour too long. What didn't help is after it was already getting long (and I was looking at my watch) the characters then explain they'll be in space for another 500-something days, we are then to REALLY prepare for a long movie. OH GREAT, I thought. I went to get a snack out of boredom. (So go to a theater with reclining seats, you may want to nap). In closing, this movie was a corny, entirely too long, rehashed stock plot of astronauts go to space, once is left behind, everyone helps him get back home.

Although the film manages to be fairly entertaining, it fails to capture the intensity of similar movies like Gravity or Apollo 13--even though the main character is stranded several million miles further away from Earth.

After some communications, NASA decides that the remaining elements of the expedition, already on their way to Earth, have the right to know what is going on and to take part, if they wish, in the effort to rescue him. Ridley Scott doesn't seem like a competent director for a film like this. I think it gave the film a tone too light, removing drama and tension. There are some moments, closer to the end, when he still tries to reverse it, but he can't and the climax is bad, although the film ends up decently entertaining us. Growing potatoes on Martian soil is something that would never have crossed my mind. I don't know how easily it would work, even if it is possible. Surviving in inhospitable places is never easy, especially for someone who has never had to, and if that is valid in our world, it would be even more valid on a strange planet. Ignoring all this, based on a theory and forgetting how difficult it is to put into practice, the film makes everything easy to do and, instead of a tense life or death situation, gives us a vacation in a Scout camp on Mars. Oh, and it is obvious that China, a dictatorship led by a madman with ambitions to control the world in the same way that he controls the life and freedom of his people, had to appear and show how, at the right time, it is capable of saving everyone and being essential to democratic countries. The cast's work is quite good. Matt Damon and Jessica Chastain are the main protagonists of this film and have put a lot of effort into their characters. This is quite obvious, and to be expected from two talented actors as they have proven themselves to be. Matt Damon, in particular, impresses his character with sympathy and seems to be a kind of ""our friendly neighbor"". Sean Bean also shone in his role, and makes a good counterpoint to the character of Jeff Daniels, who excels at the arduous task of becoming an obnoxious NASA director; Donald Glover, Kristen Wiig, Michael Peña, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan and even Chiwetel Ejiofor made a positive contribution, but the film is not theirs to shine. Technically, the film is extraordinary and had a budget to bet high. So what we have is an extraordinarily realistic set, costumes and props, combined with superb cinematography, where Mars looks beautiful, sharp and convincing. All the visual effects and CGI are good and combine very well with the rest. The soundtrack is within the expectations, in a film that does not seem to be taken seriously.","JAN 29, 2021",6,Adventure

The Martian,"A heavily over-hyped film that fails to deliver in any department, except perhaps special effects. The problem is fundamentally due to director Ridley Scott's silly adaptation of a 'nerd thriller' that compromises both scientific authenticity and story-telling charm to create an sci-fi adventure that is neither believable nor entertaining. The film pays serious attention to detail in matters such as food and water supply for The Martian yet depends on an increasingly improbable series of mishaps and 'heroic' acts to move the plot along. Surprisingly corny dialogue, lame soundtrack, forgettable acting by the supporting cast and a succession of action-adventure cliches (including that old stand-by: the kitchen-made bomb for blowing the hatch) confirms Scott's fading reputation in this genre. Let's hope NASA does better when the real thing happens.","OCT 7, 2015",5,Adventure

The Martian,I am disappointed to see that the editors decided to include Mark Watney (Matt Damon) abusing prescription drugs. During a scene he crushed Vicodin and used it by putting his potato in it as a dipping sauce (like Ketchup) and commented that he was doing it because he could. There is no reason for this scene to be in the movie. Matt Damon should be ashamed of putting it in the movie. The Producer should be ashamed of allowing it in his movie.,"APR 20, 2016",1,Adventure
The Martian,I've never found myself disagreeing with the popular opinion so greatly - but this mess of a movie was really quite bad. To begin with this movie is tonally incoherent. I was unsure if it was trying to be a serious Sci-Fi movie or a comedy. It has a promising set-up of potentially being Cast Away in space but I never felt the drama of the situation. This is probably because the majority of the drama is being told - not shown and its done uninterestingly by Matt Damon. The cast would seem better fit for an SNL movie - but here the comedy is groan-worthy. Also - this movie has very odd product placement. At one point Matt Damon whips out a bottle of Heinz Ketchup circa 2015 with no explanation why they would leave him with no food but some how be able to have Heinz on board. This movie was off the mark in almost every category but it's worst offence was taking an interesting premise and cheapening by having it described through needless narration. They either thought the demographic was too stupid to understand what was going on - or they wanted to save money by not filming the action. TL;DR don't watch this unless you want to see how a movie with a good premise can be rendered utterly mediocre,"DEC 31, 2015",0,Adventure

When will Hollywood overcome its obsession with rehashing the same old predictable dreck convinced all it has to do is smother it all with the newest fanciest CGI? This was Gravity-slash-Apollo 13-slash-Cast Away. Nothing more. It gets as high as a ""2"" score because Ridley Scott's brisk direction made it interesting at times, but then, in that sense it was also a little bit of Alien. I mean, what the mmph were they all doing out there at the beginning of the film getting the Matt Damon character almost killed? That was just too stupid right outta the gate -- I mean, the storm is so ferocious that they have to abort everything and lift off, yet there they are outside the ship traipsing about doing something God-knows-what.

I was waiting for something to happen, but it was going round and round in Astrodynamics curves which need to be met, applauding audiences on earth, heartbreaking crew members and families, and the Martian itself performing miracle after miracle. Characters have annoying habit of express and ultrafast dialogue responses of geniuses, like in a lot of movies today. So i gave up. The Botanist part of the movie was even good, but after that nothing. It's not about solitude itself, ''Castaway'' for example is much better movie.

The Martian,"Never reading reviews of movies I still knew two things about twenty minutes into this insult: 1: it would be overhyped by the bandwagon-people and 2: I would have to tear it apart on Metacritic when I got home. And I was right! Maybe I´m a psychic. Comparisons to Gravity are apt. Not because Gravity is a good movie but because, like Gravity, the Martian has some promise in the first half of the movie before taking a huge dump all over it later on. In both movies I was semi-aggressively rooting for everyone to be blown up and die. So to the plot we go! Or should I say ""the plot"". Astronaut Mark Watney, insufferable, smug wisecrack botanist, gets abandoned on Mars in unrealistic fashion. Already here the plot holes fasten their iron grip on the movie. Rather than anchoring the launch vehicle BEFORE a dust storm hits, which is what any sane person on Mars would do, this suddenly occurs to a particularly alert crew member right in the middle **** storm. And by then it is conveniently too late. I can already hear the horn music playing over the American flags here.... As ridiculous as all this is at least we now have Matt Damon stranded on a deserted planet all by his lonesomes. Parade floats for everyone! But even this semi-promising concept is then destroyed in short order. Instead of using this opportunity to explore loneliness and desperation in the film medium, Ridley ""the Fraud"" Scott has him constantly talking to a video log. And not only is he talking to a video log the entire movie but he is doing a poor stand up comedy routine while making never ending Roger Ramjet inspirational talks to himself. A movie about a man stranded in outer space manages to talk you to death; there should be an Oscar for this alone. So nonsense nonsense nonsense later and the returning crew who abandoned the comedian on Mars ""heroically"" decide to make an ad hoc return to Mars to save him. As soon as this happened you knew that nobody would be dying during this insane endeavour because that would make it pointless to return to save one person. Either they all survive and horn music or they all die and violins. And this is Hollywood. They are all going to survive and horn music and we all know it. And what do you know, reclusive geniuses hiding in corners at NASA, blowing up the ship to slow it down and poking holes in a spacesuit to fly through space later and there´s paper throwing at Johnson Space Center, horn music and a farewell inspirational from Roger Ramjet back home on earth and USA USA USA USA USA!!!!!!! This movie has nothing to elevate it above the Hollywood bilge we keep being flooded with and demonstrates very clearly why American cinema is a dead concept. Hollywood is nothing more than a ****, endlessly flooding the world with intellectual poison, and the Martian is a textbook example of it. Awash in political correctness and propaganda it is now apparently impossible for Americans to produce science fiction movies, or any other movies for that matter, of even decent quality. Or in this case pseudo science realism movies, which is even worse. Iranian cinema is now vastly better than American cinema. Have a think about that for a second if you will. In 1974 John Carpenter made the movie Dark Star. The space monster in this movie was literally a beach ball with hair and feet glued to it. Dark Star is a superb movie compared to the Martian and if you still haven´t been tricked by all the ridiculous hype over this move, go watch Dark Star instead. That´s how bad this is here. I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT I HATE IT!!!!!!!!!! This would have been a ten times better movie if everyone had died in space. But it´s Hollywood and it´s for degenerate American audiences and you need to have bombs, stupidity and horn music save the world every time or they will all start crying. Ridley Bruckheimer is a giant fraud who should retire to one of his mansions and pack it up. He has not made a good movie since 1979. BOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!","OCT 27, 2015",1,Adventure

Acting across the board seemed wooden & plain - swap the humans for puppets & some of the scenes set on Mars were like a Thunderbirds episode. The wacky humour(?) parts were forced & unfunny. While the nerdy components were very interesting they felt crammed & at times unnecessary. The movie jumped around & made limited sense in parts. ""You can bring anything you want to Mars but unfortunately we only have room for 5 disco mp3s"". Matt wouldn't have run out of tomato sauce (ketchup) if he hadn't of used a gallon on one meal the idiot.

The Martian,"The fact that this film received so many good reviews has made me lose my respect for humanity. It seems North American culture has been seriously dumbed-down, now lacking any measure of critical thought. This film was mediocre at best. Yes, the Mars landscape was nicely done; but visual effects alone don't make a decent movie - the effects of Gravity were much better, in my opinion. A good film requires a good story, plot, dialogue, suspense, acting, etc. The Martian was so predictable it was boring. Damon's acting was adequate but forgetable. I felt nothing for any of the characters, and couldn't care what happened to them as the film ignored any potential psychological and emotional aspects of the story. Most of the characters acted like frat boys, not like professionals you'd expect in these roles. Damon's ""kiss my ass Neil Armstrong"" and other painful and foul-mouthed quips seem to appeal to a ""now generation"" too wrapped up in themselves to respect and honor past achievements - a professional astronaut certainly wouldn't act like that. And the disco music score was odd, jarring, like a drunk uncle karaoke-ing at a wedding. If this film was meant to be drama/comedy/sci-fi it fell flat on all accounts, appealing to the lowest common denominator. In my opinion, this is typical Hollywood capitalist crap, enabled by a well-bribed mass media, out to rip off people for profit (why can't I get a refund?), completely lacking in substance, made for dumb people who haven't picked up a book in their lives. And the positive reviews on here and elsewhere reveal a serious decline in taste. Has everyone become pigs satisfied with slop?","NOV 14, 2015",3,Adventure

The Martian,"Okay, I am also perplexed as to why people have given this terrible movie a favorable review. It seems like all we care about is a big name director and big star, then the movie has instant credibility. There was not one truly memorable moment in this movie. I cannot remember a single word, phrase, exchange of dialogue, or turn of event that left a lasting impression. The only positives were Matt Damon's likability and some decent special effects. For one thing how can this premise be taken ass even remotely plausible? Does anyone think that we would send ship to Mars that is vulnerable to a naturally and regularly occurring storm on Mars? And who would design a ship that is docked so perilously? It was standing up like one of those red/white/blue popsicle rocket treats we used to get from the ice cream man as a kid. Or even more than that it looked like a ship from a 1950's era sci-fi movie. C'mon man, this is a new millennium. Make a ship that is supported as it would be supported on Mars. It should be shorter and more stable, not doomed to tip over like shown in the movie. That one scene lost me for the next 30 minutes. Here are the other things I feel left me wanting with that movie. 1. When the storm struck I didn't know who was left behind. I knew it was the Matt Damon character but I didn't ""know"" him, meaning I had no emotional investment in that character. 2. He was a botanist, how convenient. His character didn't have to transform or change in any way in order to survive; he was the perfect guy to be left behind. 3. And just why were the potatoes going to run out??? They said you have 400 and something days, but never said why. Was it because there were other vital nutrients that would be lacking at that point? 4. If you give me 2 years to figure out how to solve a problem that means my survival, and there's nothing else to do but figure it out, I bet I'l find something too. The dates before his food was going to run out were so far out that I never felt a sense of urgency. You can call Mars ""The Monster"" but it wasn't pursuing the main character, just waiting for him to run out of food. How boring is that??? 5. When was the last time we saw nobody but good guys in a movie? There was nobody to blame, no bad guys anywhere. That was just plain weak. A bad guys doesn't have to be a bad person, just a person who either has too much fear or fears the wrong thing, which causes him/her to make poor choices. Nobody served as a villain in any way. I know from playing sports and working in small and large companies that there's always a person who feels like the bad guy, even unintentionally. This movie, with it's little slice of heaven, was absurd to say the least. For these reasons and other minor reasons I was totally disappointed. My wife liked it and I couldn't understand why. This was the dumbest movie I've seen in a long time. I really wanted to like ti but was terribly disappointed.","MAR 15, 2016",1,Adventure

All that being said, I simply can not say anything positive about The Martian. It was two and a half hours of pure boredom. Matt Damon is so unlikable that I literally was rooting against him the entire time. Every five minutes the film stops to give some long, drawn out science explanation of what's going on and its absolutely yawn provoking. Two and a half hours of this movie formula is better than drinking a half bottle of Nightquil to help induce slumber. It was simply an unpleasant, boring, drawn out movie going experience to me.

Even the Communist Chinese in Beijing decide to save the day, while the Russians are nixed from any sort of existence. Ironic, considering NASA rides their rockets to space these days. Every single choice is politically slanted, and Ridley Scott returns to his TV Commercial roots. What is he selling? The film has no spiritual backbone, no depth, no real surprises and it recycles shots and models from Avatar and other films. It's a really ****ty movie, with a decent final 10 minutes.

The Martian,"I think the word is ""drivel."" And I should qualify this claim: I swear I'm not a snob, or a snark. I love science fiction, and love being at the theater, and consider myself easy enough to please. I'm not a film-scholar, though I do see a lot of movies, and am reasonably aware of film history, genre conventions etc. So, despite some gripes, Gravity (5 score) was watchable in theaters. And despite some gripes, Interstellar (6 score) was watchable in theaters. Which is all I can ask for, and all a block-buster can aim to do. Hold my attention, *or* show me pretty pictures (it doesn't have to be all both), and I'll gladly walk away, less $14.50. You don't even have to stir my heart, or make me think to get my money! This should be so easy, right? Wrong. I have two major problems that make The Martian if not un-watchable, certainly not re-watchable, and certainly not worth $14.50 (Gravity and Interstellar I would also consider not re-watchable, but worth $14.50). These gripes (like any) assume that you're like me: an *adult* who sees movies and doesn't appreciate being condescended by studios pushing plush toys made out of hobbits, vampires, GI Joes, barbies, yodas and Will Ferrell. But sill, an adult that (I hope) isn't a **** or ""aficionado"" for dismissing the last fifteen years of mega-frachises (OK, fine, Avatar was way fun, I said it). 1). Regarding the look: I have no idea how they messed this up, but it's not particularly pretty. And I'm sentimental for deserts! And I think Mars is so cool! You had me! There just isn't enough Mars in The Martian. The quips are OK, the scientific accuracy is fine (though I honestly don't care one way or the other; I like both versions of sci-fi), the acting is fine, music I don't remember so it must have been fine. Just not nearly enough Mars in a movie with Matt Damon, co-starring, well, Mars. 2). Regarding the much acclaimed story: I'm pretty sure Castaway was plotted better, both in the pace, and in outcome. Again, despite some gripes, Castaway dealt very well with the survivor's mental state and desperation, and the very real struggles with personal and cultural re-acclimation upon his return. The Martian is a story for children with no complex character themes. As a result, there was (for me) no real draw or suspense. The secondary crisis (after ""Will he get out alive?"" which is also not very compelling) is about how his crew might feel if they found out they left him behind, if NASA is morally obligated to tell them, and, if they do feel obligated, when they should tell them. These questions motivate all of the non-Martian-surface drama, and it's boring. I love the idea of crowd sourcing a novel, getting your facts right, and nerding out on the scientific accuracy, but this is a bad plot. Bottom line: The Martian isn't pretty enough to compensate for a lackluster story.","OCT 5, 2015",3,Adventure

My teeth clenched so hard at the movies when ABBA started playing and Matt started **** up to the women with that crappy song(And im not talking about the other **** up songs either).NASA sent a bunch of humans to plant spuds on Mars because you know thats all humans can plant right? Such a JOKE, From him almost freezing to death and radioacting his brain to stay warm, Then to sticky taping his Fragile Crappy helmet. Every women in NASA is attractive according to Ridley Scott, even the dumb ones sitting in the background have no purpose in the movie, They are just there for the feminists just like in Jurassic World. There is a brainwashing bit with the black techno guy and the smart attractive NASA blonde where he points at her and says, You are MARS, I think he said it to target the women who want to feel important so they keep watching the crappy movie and buy into stereotyping(Kinda like a control freak.) Your IQ will drop if you watch this movie...maybe Jimmy Kimmel was right to stand him up because you dont want to be stood up by Matt Demon I mean Damon like i was. 0/10 If there was a alien civilisation on MARS Matt Damon just took a crap on them so dont be suprised if we get invaded by Matt Damon Shiit demons from Dogma......","OCT 22, 2015",0,Adventure

Thor: Love and Thunder,"Gute Unterhaltung. Zwar stört mich, dass man Zeus eigentlich nicht tötet und sein 'Werkzeug' mal eben so klaut, aber das ganze Popcorn-Drama wirkt unendlich nahbar und herrlich warmherzig. Ein weiteres Lob an Kevin Feige, der erneut einen guten digital Streifen aus den Marvel-Comics geschaffen hat. Noch ein bisschen Tech: Die deutsche Streaming- Tonspur wirkt evtl. Gut auf einem Tablet, Handy oder Mittelklasse Soundbar, aber für ein edles HighEnd Heimkino (Arcam - Dynaudio) wirkt sie etwas zu 'komprimiert' (Anmerkung: Hier erfolgt noch ein Test, wenn die Standard-UHD released ist). Man braucht reichlich Endstufen Power um es hier halbwegs 'krachen' zu lassen. Desweiteren ist das Bildformat mit 21:9 höchst antiquarisch veraltet und bedarf einer zeitgemäßen Abtastung (16:9 oder besser IMAX). Zu guter letzt finde ich, dass dieser Marvel-Film nicht sehr gut mit den restlichen Filmen vernetz ist. Ansonsten Top! Gute Unterhaltung :) -- Good entertainment. It bothers me that you don't actually kill Zeus and just steal his 'tools' just like that, but the whole popcorn drama seems infinitely approachable and wonderfully warm-hearted. Another kudos to Kevin Feige for creating yet another fine digital flick from the Marvel Comics. A bit more tech: The German streaming soundtrack may work well on a tablet, cell phone or mid-range soundbar, but it seems a bit too 'compressed' for a noble high-end home cinema (Arcam - Dynaudio) (Note: Here is another test, when the standard UHD is released). You need a lot of power amplifiers to let it 'rip' halfway here. Furthermore, the picture format of 21:9 is extremely outdated and requires up-to-date scanning (16:9 or better IMAX). Finally, I feel that this Marvel film doesn't mesh very well with the rest of the films. Otherwise great! Good entertainment :) (Google Translate form german)","NOV 19, 2022",7,Adventure

Thor: Love and Thunder,"As usual for the MCU, 'Thor: Love and Thunder' is a good watch. I did want more from it, though. Chris Hemsworth remains the star of the show, I'm adding nothing new by saying he is just perfect for the role. Tessa Thompson, Taika Waititi and Natalie Portman all make for good support. Christian Bale is also someone I enjoyed, I like the look of his character but kinda felt that I wanted to see more of him - it's like we see a beginning and an end, but part of me feels like we coulda had something in-between. The special effects are solid, as is the music; even if the track choices aren't the most creative. I probably would've shortened the run time a little, though that isn't anything all that noteworthy to be honest. There are some funny moments in there, which is always something I expect from a Taika Waititi flick. As for me and my own personal Thor ranking, this - like the 2011 original (also 3) - isn't one of my favourites (fwiw, I enjoy 'Thor: The Dark World' and 'Thor: Ragnarok' (both 4) way more) but it's still a fun enough time that I'd recommend it.

And while yes, it was more humorous than even Thor: Ragnorok, it worked for me. It was very funny to me, very entertaining, gorgeous to look at, and I very enjoyable. Even the kids stuff wasn't overbearing. The real highlight was Christian Bale in the interviews for this. You don't normally get to see too much of who he really is, and that one incident (on Terminator Salvation, which I actually agree with him on, despite how he handled it), has haunted him. He's actually delightful and a breath of fresh air, because he genuinely doesn't seem to give a **** Overall I highly recommend this.

Christian Bale as Gorr was a too generic of a villain, seen it before in dozens of movies and was a dime in a dozen. Marvel has become a money hogging scam and trying to milk this franchise as much as possible with nonsensical storylines.

Thor: Love and Thunder,"Thor: Love and Thunder, directed by Taika Waititi, sought to continue the story of the God of Thunder with a mix of action, humor and emotion. However, despite some standout moments, the film fails to capture the magic of its predecessors and falls short in several aspects. One of Thor: Love and Thunder's main flaws lies in its inconsistent script and messy narrative. The film attempts to address multiple plots and subplots, but fails to give them proper attention and development. This results in an unbalanced and confusing story, where the main focus is lost and the emotions that should drive it are diluted. Although a Thor movie is expected to offer epic action, in Thor: Love and Thunder, these sequences fail to fully impact. Although there are highlights of battles and fights, overall, they lack the intensity and impressive choreography that we have seen in other installments of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This can lead the audience to feel disconnected from the action sequences and diminish their emotional impact. In terms of humor, Thor: Love and Thunder tries to maintain the light and comedic tone that characterizes the franchise. However, this time around, the jokes and funny moments feel forced and excessive. Instead of complementing the plot and adding levity, the humor sometimes distracts and affects the overall pace of the film. The cast, led by Chris Hemsworth as Thor, delivers solid performances, but the supporting characters don't receive adequate development. Some new characters feel underused and fail to leave a lasting impression. Furthermore, certain dramatic moments lack the emotional depth that would be expected, which prevents us from fully connecting with the characters' internal conflicts. In terms of visuals and special effects, Thor: Love and Thunder generally delivers. The action scenes are well done and the visual effects are solid. However, they fail to stand out or offer anything truly innovative or surprising compared to other films in the genre. In short, Thor: Love and Thunder is a failed attempt to capture the magic and charm of its predecessors. The messy narrative, the lack of intensity in the action sequences and forced humor are some of the main weaknesses of the film. Although the cast delivers solid performances, the supporting characters lack proper development. Although it offers some interesting visual glimpses, overall, Thor: Love and Thunder fails to reach the level of quality expected in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.","JUN 24, 2023",4,Adventure

Thor: Love and Thunder,"It is the kind of movie that is entertaining until you start really thinking about it. I actually liked it first and was leaning towards an 8/10. Then I noticed more and more flaws. Lets start at the beginning. The Thor movies were a staple and the previous movie Thor Ragnarök was the best of them. So we all were happy that director Taika Waititi returns. However phase 4 of Marvel is a bit divisive to say it mildly. It taught me and my friends not to watch the movies in the cinema without consulting reviews by trustworthy critics first. As the reviews came in it looked like a disaster. So I waited until it came to Disney+. After the introduction of a character I wont spoil it follows the set up of Avengers Endgame were Thor travels alongside the Guardians of the Galaxy. However he has some sort of a midlife crisis when he gets an emergency message. Someone is on a quite successful journey to kill all gods in the universe. This is the set up. They use a famous story arc from the comics for this and I hesitate only to say the comics are better because of Christian Bales great performance. While the story is decent to good the characters feel a bit weird. Thor behaves a bit strange and also Jane and Valkyrie feel sometimes forced into character changes that are not explained well. Don't get me wrong I like both the characters and actors. The cast with Chris Hemswort, Natalie Portman, Christian Bale and, Tessa Thomson are great. Also I like all the children and cameos in the theatre scene. The fights are amazing and the final battle is quite entertaining. Never underestimate a bunch of …. The humour was the most divisive part in other reviews. A lot of people say the use too much humour and it drags the movie down. I disagree as it was not that overburdened for me. However not all jokes are good and this drags it down a little but to be fair there are some incredible humorous and entertaining scenes. The special effects are top notch as always. The sets and costumes mostly deliver and I would praise the movie in this regard. The negatives are that like I said the characters are a bit strange compared to before, the story they follow from the comics is better and I do not like a bit of the arcs and developments. Overall I am a bit divided. The more I think about the movie the lower my rating goes. It tricked me not enough into making me believe its awesome. I give a 6/10.","SEP 10, 2022",6,Adventure

Thor: Love and Thunder,"At its heart, and yes, there is a lot of heart here, THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER is a fun, action-filled Marvel movie that is one of the better ones to come in this tiresome post-ENDGAME phase. This is a movie where the hero's journey is is purposeful and resolute, not only for Thor Odinson but Jane Foster as well. To get on that road, though, takes a lot of patience. As fun as LOVE AND THUNDER is, the movie is also childish, idiotic, superficial, and features way too many Guns-n-Roses anthems. The first twenty or so minutes, where Thor goofs off with the equally-juvenile Guardians of the Galaxy, would tax even the strongest of Asgardian gods. Once the threat of Gorr, the god butcher, arrives on New Asgard's steps, the heroes' quest begins - and that is a most satisfactory story. Taika Waititi makes use of Chris Hemsworth's generous smile and biceps in a familiar and comfortable manner. Thor takes on the mantle of leader and proves he is quite sufficient in the role. Smashing and thrashing and joking (maybe a touch too much of the levity this time around, though) leads to a successful, and actually unsuspecting, ending where you are craving more. First and foremost, Thor is a hero. Hopefully future appearances of the Thunder God will focus more on this aspect and keep the over-the-top humor in reserve.

I remember watching the first one when it came out and loving how 90s it was. It had that mixture of gritty action of the 80s but was also campy, slightly upbeat and kind of signalled that sense of optimism everyone had after the Cold War ended(none of us are enemies now, we're all on the same page kind of vibe). It was awesome, and I liked the way this one captured that same tone in never taking itself too seriously whilst also creating a certain sense of suspense at the same time(yeah we all know the goods guys are going to win, but the journey matters more than the destination). For everyone who's pretty cynical or prefers hyper-realistic sci-fi, don't go for this, but if you just enjoy alot of crazy weapons tearing things apart and some pretty cool dogfight scenes, go for it. I loved the way they brought back alot of the old characters and had that sense of harking back to the last film without completely leeching off it.

When you have your nerdy white dude scientist single-handedly mow down and entire battalion of alien troopers, or a pair of pilots stop the invasion in its tracks; it signals that you are not taking your own movie seriously and neither should the audience. The worst part is that all of the pieces of a decent movie are there. They are just assembled in such a rushed and incoherent fashion. And while I adore the veteran actors from the original movie, even their acting made me cringe at times. The plot and the characters were all severely underdeveloped and the dialogue was dripping with cheese. The most redeemable aspect of this movie **** guessed **** CGI.

Resurgence makes it a point to never take itself seriously. It's got a silly sense of humor in the face of it's potentially world ending conflict. The human race is facing it's possible extinction and everyone is smiling and cracking jokes. While this does add a extra sense of fun to the movie, it also makes it hard to really care about what's going on. There's simply no urgency to the events. The new characters are bland and there's no way to get emotionally invested at all. This is the kind of movie you watch for the visual panache and not much else. There's a lot of cool sci-fi stuff onscreen to keep things interesting enough to keep you watching. It just doesn't engage your brain. But hey, it's fun for what it is. I got some laughs and some cool action. That's really all I was expecting anyway. Fans of the first can get a kick out of seeing the familiar faces return (with the exception of Will Smith) and references.

I know that the critics have been lambasting this movie for a week, but I figured I had now been inoculated against major disappointment and what the heck. I caught the 1:30 matinee in a mostly empty theater with only a few, elderly retired couples. I guess they had nothing better to do either on a Monday afternoon. I found the movie mildly entertaining, much like a Transformers movie, which also promises wanton, unnecessary destruction on a global scale. Neither movies, this or the Transformers franchise, makes any pretenses of sophistication, pathos or intellectually redeeming qualities like The Martian or Interstellar. Jeff Goldblum is funny as is Judd Hirsch. Brent Spiner probably single-handedly carried this movie and of course he sets up the sequel at the end.

But I won't do that for all the films like perhaps 'Taken' and this one. These are not designed for that kind of a stretch or to own a franchise. So anyway they have made it and I'd watched. Since I was not expecting it, I did not care about the how it ends. I mean critically failed and the box office was okay, but did not meet the expectations. I mean not found anywhere near to the original film's collection. For me, minus half point for the Chinese flavour. I think the Hollywood must stop leaning towards Chinese contents. It is like they are ignoring the rest of the world. I want the old days American films, not this yuan targeted films. Sorry, that is one of the reasons why I disliked films like this, 'Now You See Me 2' and many other recent sino-Hollywood films. This story takes place 20 years later to the original film. Only a handful of characters returned and many of them were new. So now the humans leaped forward after adapting the alien technology. But when they learn the distress call was sent to the base of the enemy from the 20 years ago event, they are underprepared for another alien attack that follows very soon. Without any option they push their full force to defend the earth and it would they succeed or not is what the remaining film to reveal. Nowadays the graphics are not an issue. The filmmaking had touched down for a standard in the visual quality, especially a big production like this. So those parts even overplay the performances of the real actors. We have seen that from Gollum, King Kong and many other monster films. So if you are watching a today's high end film means, it is a pleasure from the blow ups we expect the most. Similar to killings from the horror thrillers. This film does that so well, that mean it is entertaining, but not the overall film very praisable. This story can be easily connected to many classics such as 'Star Wars' and 'Avatar'. Because how it ends seems like a story about the origins of those films. So the third film is like definitely takes us deep into the space. Looks very interesting, but does it work is the real question. It is already in the work with the same director. So lets wait and see how it corrects its mistakes. Meantime, you can watch this if you haven't yet, but it is an average film. 5.5/10","NOV 4, 2016",6,Adventure

The primary fault with the movie is you do not really feel anything for the main characters or most of the characters for the most part except for maybe Pullman and Goldblum. They are just kind of there. It's an entertaining popcorn flick with no heart. Did not having Will Smith hurt it? Did he make a right choice by not being in it? Would Will Smith made the movie better? Probably. But we will never know. If you are a fan of the first and you are sitting on the fence, wait for the blu ray. Like I said earlier in the review.

You just can't get enough of the Goldblum, as he always got this welcoming presence to him in every movie he's in. I was never bored while watching the movie and this is the kind of the film that would have been great if it was released in the 90's like the first movie, as this would have fitted right in. Unfortunately, ""Resurgence"" misses a lot of the charm and charisma that the first film had, as the squeal is just mindless entertainment and if you enjoy those type of films then you most likely going to like this one. The amount of coincidences that happens in this movie is quite unbelievable, with character's coming across each other by accident or how the problems are solved was way too easy. And it's attempt of humor was a bit awkward and force, but that's mostly because the movie doesn't want to be too dark or serious for audience members, so the humor is thrown in there to lighten up the mood.

Independence Day: Resurgence,"It's hard to nail down where this movie goes wrong exactly. Probably because it goes wrong in so many different ways, but not so much to fall completely flat in any one category. Only ten minutes in and you'll realize the story is far too disjointed. There's no flow to the movie. There's no time to make us care about the characters, or for character progression, or much in the way of back stories. Which might not be a bad thing considering how bland the new cast is. Also, if a movie is going to take itself serious, it better make logical sense. This movie had so many cop-outs and miraculous coincidences, it's difficult to suspend your disbelief long enough to actually enjoy it. The characters often make incredible leaps of insight that no one could actually do. ""They're drilling. Oh, they must be here to harvest our molten core!"" What? How'd you come to that conclusion? I mean, even the opening credits had a logic fail, where the aliens somehow had a recording of the President's 4th of July speech from the original movie! How exactly did they get that? I think the biggest problems with this movie were the screenwriting and the directing. Scenes often didn't go together cohesively in a logical way. Their homages to the original amounted to basically copying and pasting lines directly from it. Most of the gags fell short, or were overly cheesy for the seriousness of what was going down. Characters didn't react realistically to what was going on around them. I could go on and on with these faults. As I mentioned before, the visuals were top-notch. I have a serious hatred for CGI that doesn't look realistic, yet gladly this movie doesn't fall into that trap. It has plenty of CGI, but it is incredibly well done. Too bad the other aspects of the movie don't match up. If nothing else, this movie has shown me how much I want a GOOD space opera. Yet sadly, it may also be the reason we don't get one in the near future. Good luck with that third installment Fox.","JUL 16, 2016",4,Adventure

Independence Day: Resurgence,"After seeing the criticism I ask what did people expect here? A Shakespearean play or something that ashamed the Godfather 1 and 2 movies and becomes the new gold standard? Yes it is not up there with the best movies of all times and this is an undeniable fact. However it never claims or wants to be there. Like its prequel it is B-movie inspired with all tropes, cheesiness and entertainment value. It is in the realm of enjoyable popcorn movies where you don't have to follow a huge plot (Some name this category “Turn your brains of movie”). For this it works well and when it has a weakness compared to the first in this regard then it camouflaged its weaknesses not as good. It is the kind of weaker but not garbage sequel that often happen in Hollywood or the movie industry in general. Story: It continues the story of the prequel. 20 years have passed since the conclusion. Mankind has rebuild what was destroyed and adapted the alien technology. Since they knew that another invasion will come many defense measures were put in place. Now the dreaded day has come and humanities resolve and preparations will again be put on test. Again it follows the story of the main characters in the following days. I say its a standard story and expands the lore. It is enough to kept you entertained but not enough to be praised or remembered well. They want to recreated the feeling of the first movie and it works more than it fails. I must also admit that it is weaker, less refreshing and has not the pathos. Also the cast cant keep up with the prequel and I was notice some flaws in the logic of the story (There is the argument that a movie can get away with a lot of **** if it is really engaging and entertaining). Cast: I say Will Smith missing harms the movie a bit. There were multiple rumors why. From being to expensive, to not want to star in another science fiction movie up to just timely restrains. Luckily Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman return to their roles as David Levinson and Thomas J. Whitmore. Bot give a good performance. The new cast with Liam Hamsworth as Jake Morrison, Maika Monroe as Patricia Whitmore and Jessie Usher as Dylan Hiller cant truly convince me. It is neither amazing nor bad. Angela Yeung Wing (Angelababy) however is really good. Brent Spiner returns as Dr. Brackish Okun and while he is better than in the prequel I still say he is misused by the script. The rest did a solid performance. In total I say there is no great misstep but also not enough to improve the rating or outstanding character performances. Presentation: Again the special effects are great and deliver a believable experience. The sets, costumes and other effects are good too and I see no missteps here. The soundtrack was neither remarkable nor bad. It enhanced the scenes and that is O.K. for me. Overall this was what I expected. It tries to capture what made the first movie a success and tries to recreating the experience. The result is a weaker but still enjoyable movie. Maybe not worth watching except you are a fan of the prequel but also by no measure a failure (Except maybe at box office as it generated not the aimed 3 times the production costs that is considered a success). It deserves however not the criticism even when it is not a great movie.","JUL 19, 2021",6,Adventure

From then on it lost more and more credibility. Events in this movie were all just too coincidental. Main characters encounter eachother just in the right time at the right moment and these moments follow up pretty quickly. It also features some dumb jokes, overdone CGI world destruction which would have destroyed the planet by long if it really happened that way, racial stereotypes (cheering buddhists and arab nomads when the world is saved), everybody just seems to want to sacrifice their lives for the great cause and noone blinks an eye, cheesy motivational speeches and a star wars like vibe when they dogfight the alien aircrafts. Also they recycled the destroy the beehive queen and they'll just walk away plot which was so predictable. And they just had to scream like they were rambo eveytime they did a difficult maneuver in an aircraft. The movie would've been a lot better if you had an open ending in where the Earth would suffer a great loss and they would recuperate in the next movie.

Independence Day: Resurgence,"I enjoyed ""Independence Day (1996)"" even if the movie itself was dumb and silly because, in the end, it was incredibly fun. I was honestly surprised to hear the movie get a sequel 20 years later but the trailers never really pulled me in and all the bad reviews deterred me from giving it a watch myself. Plus Will Smith was not returning due to scheduling conflict with Suicide Squad and they decided to have his character killed off-screen which is annoying. Still, Roland Emmerich who directed the first one was returning for the sequel so it had potential to be good. Anyway since it is independence day I've decided to give the movie a chance and see for myself if the movie was as bad as people say it was. Firstly, I want to praise the concept and idea of this movie. The humans using alien technology and preparing for the next alien invasion is an interesting idea. Shame they don't do much with it but oh well. The destruction in the first act of the movie is cool though and the CGI, in general, is visually impressive. Secondly, I've got to praise the returning actors' Jeff Goldblum, Brent Spiner and Bill Pullman who return as their respective characters from the first movie. Both Jeff, Brent and Bill still give great, charismatic performances despite the really poor script. Experience and veteran actors like Sela Ward as the new president and William Fichtner as space commander are also really good in the film. Liam Hemsworth as ""Jake Morrison"" is one of the few genuinely good new and young actors and is also able to give a somewhat good performance with the bad script. That is all the praise I can give this movie because it is bad and not a good sequel. On the topic of new actors, Jessie Usher as ""Dylan Hiller"" stepson of ""Steven Hiller"", Will Smith's character from the first movie, is terrible. Jessie has no charm or any of the emotional range of Steven Hiller. He never gives any quips like Steven and the moments that are meant to be emotional are not there because Jessie fails to deliver a good performance. It may not necessarily be his fault as the script is atrocious but his character doesn't live up to his father. There is also this Chinese actress Angela Yeung Wing as ""Rain Lao"" who is quite bad as well as she gives a boring performance but then again her character is just written to be a good looking person in the battle. Another reason why this script is really poor. The other new actors do a somewhat decent job but none of them really stand out. I've already mentioned a dozen times but the script is just dumb. A fair amount of lines spouted out by the actors just feel like it was written by a 10-year-old and are not even amusing or funny. A lot of dialogue feel utterly meaningless and add nothing to the movie. One of the charms about the original movie was the quips of Will Smith which even though it was cheesy, it was able to give me a small chuckle. In this movie, it feels like they are trying really hard to get us to laugh with over the top cartooney performance and dumb written dialogue. Unfortunately, it doesn't work and it makes this movie almost a pain to get through. The story in the first movie was dumb and despite the interesting idea in this movie, it is still pretty dumb. Just like the first movie, you are going to have to shut your logic brain because a lot of moments in this movie require you to just believe that can happen. However, the third act in this movie is even more unconvincing and more stupid than the first movie and makes me genuinely believe the aliens are stupid. It also retreads a lot of similar ground to the first movie with destruction first act then attempted but failed mission second act and unconvincing plan but successful third act. It's just the same plot and concept of the first movie but given a new coat of paint and that is lazy. Additionally, the action scenes in this movie are just not as entertaining as the first one. There is a dogfight similar to the first movie but in this case, it is just a cluster of grey CGI spaceships shooting laser beams all over the place with no idea who the good guys and bad guys are. It's just boring and uninspiring. The final fight is also just not that epic and had a lot of incredibly stupid moments. This is a very unsatisfying sequel and is inferior to the first movie in everywhere. Independence day 1996 was dumb but unique and was a really fun experience. However, Independence Day Resurgence is just dumb in general. The movie also has the nerve and audacity to tease a sequel at the end and honestly with its poor box office performance, I am glad that it will never happen. The first movie made an alien invasion exciting, Resurgence makes it forgettable and boring.","JUL 4, 2020",2,Adventure

The cynicism of the depiction of each character, or maybe it is the utter talentlessness of the writers, or the lacklustre storytelling of the director, this piece of garbage is the reason Hollywood is slowly dying.

Independence Day: Resurgence,"As was proven with Core, there actually is a way to do these event/disaster/nuclear bombs are good movies the right way. Such movies need to be so over the top, so ridiculous, so free of any political statements and so cleverly scripted that you forget that you're supposed to loathe stupidity and instead accept the nonsense as somehow natural. Independence Day: Resurgence does some of this but nowhere near enough. It manages to get serious and sentimental at the most laughable of times while completely missing any opportunities to insert some much needed comic relief. It also repeats the cardinal mistake made in the first one by having the president of the present world empire and his nuclear weapons save humanity. If the Germans had won the war, Independence Day: Resurgence would have featured **** flying fighter planes against the evil aliens. But they didn't so the US president gets the job. Good movies need to find a way to save the world that does not include the Pentagon or corrupt politicians and other control freaks. There has never been a heroic US president. Never. So why do we have to have one in Independence Day? It's like having an honest lawyer or economist in a movie. No one would watch it because it's not realistic. Heroic US presidents are even less realistic, yet somehow we're supposed to accept it in movies. And obviously the heroic president loves him some world empire, just like Wall Street and the other fatcats who are screwing us over. What a coincidence that the imaginary heroic president wants to rule the world, exactly like his non-heroic real world counterparts! The propaganda just never ends here. Accept US world empire or you're with the aliens(terrorists/communists/insert next bogus scare here)! So when you go balls to the wall with this low grade US militarism propaganda all chance of a light approach go out the window. You either love the empire and cheer for the humans or you hate it and are forced to cheer for the aliens. You know they're losing anyway, so no matter how big their boat is they are the eternal and doomed underdogs in Hollywood movies. So, definitely a big thumbs up for all the people who take US war propaganda seriously and people who tear up when nuclear bombs, unbelievable stupidity and horn music save the world once again. A rather big thumbs down if you don't respond well or at all to these things. Other than the embarrassingly obvious propaganda in Independence Day: Resurgence, the only other reason to watch it might be the visuals. But how many different tidal waves can Hollywood make where the eastern seaboard of the United States gets destroyed before people lose interest? In another case of blatantly obvious and slimy imperialist propaganda, the tidal wave in this awful movie manages to stop just outside the west wall of the White House; or as I prefer to call it: the Pig House. Oh and the acting is atrocious as well, and so is the writing. If you don't like Jeff Goldblum this will do nothing for you. Unfortunately I find him to be about as convincing an actor as Steven Segal, so for me he actually manages to drag something that belongs in a toilet already through all the sewage pipes and off to sea whenever he is in a movie.

This movie is an absolute IMPROVEMENT over the original nightmare of a ""film"" in every way possible. It removes some horrific dumpster fires of characters like sHAnG and MuShU and the godawful CrICkET. But aside from that, it replaces them with meaningful, well written new characters like the Phoniex Witch that can turn into a bunch of birds. It also introduces a Chi, an awesome sword that is very useful and welcoming in battle, and it makes Mulan into an actual CHARACTER rather than a lazy stupidly clumsy PRINCESS like the original film's version of her that's helplessly waiting for her prince. Please pay the price to view this amazing film! It should be taught in film school, let's be real and very honest.","OCT 21, 2021",10,Adventure

Mulan,"E-Value: 7 Acting: 8 Plot: 6 Mulan is the latest Disney live-action remake of their 1998 movie of the same name. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic which forced theatres to shut down, The Walt Disney Company have decided to release Mulan via Disney+ for a premium fee while other countries will have theatrical release where the local theatres have been slowly reopened. Set in Imperial China, Hua Mulan (Yifei) is an adventurous and active girl much to her parents’ disappointment who had hope to find her a good husband. Somewhere in the Imperial outpost to the north, Rouran warriors led by Bori Khan (Lee) attack the outpost with the help of a powerful and shapeshifter witch named Xian Niang (played by Gong Li). Because of the attack, the Emperor of China (played by Jet Li) decree that every family in the country must contribute one man to fight against the invaders. Unfortunately for the Hua family, Mulan does not have any brothers which means her father, who is a former soldier in the Imperial Army, must contribute himself to fight in the war. Due to her father’s ailing health and may not survive the war, Mulan decide to take her father’s place as soldier and sneak out of her home at night along with her father’s sword and armour. Disguising herself as a man and called herself Hua Jun, she joins the Imperial Army under the command of Commander Tung (Yen) where she trains with the other conscripts to prepare for the upcoming war without exposing herself as a woman. Unlike last year’s Aladdin and The Lion King live-action remakes, Mulan is not a full adaptation of its animated movie as there are some changes in this movie. Despite the changes, the basic plot of the movie still remains the same as its original counterpart and easy to follow. While Mushu does not appear in this movie and no singing songs moments, it really does make sense for not to be in this movie is because it would have been unrealistic given the direction of this movie. For the performance of the cast, everyone has done a great job especially Liu Yifei and Donnie Yen. However, some of the characters didn’t really have much character development which made them easily forgettable later on. As for Gong Li’s character, I felt her character wasn’t really developed well and her character’s purpose was only to serve as the evil counterpart to Mulan. While this movie cannot be compared to 2009’s Mulan: Rise of a Warrior, which is a Chinese production and with more realistic and darker tone, this movie is still watchable on its own and it is meant for family and children. Same goes to the original animated movie. Whichever one is better is up for a debate. If you have seen the original animated movie and the 2009 movie, give this movie a shot.","OCT 23, 2020",7,Adventure

Mulan,"Saw 2020's 'Mulan' as a massive Disney fan. Although their recent live action offerings are very mixed and none are as good as the originals, many of their animated films are fine examples of how to do animation right. Looking at the title, the advertising and that seeing it was made by Disney, it is very easy to think that this is another one of the live action remakes and it is easy why it has been critiqued as one. Part of me was really psyched being somebody who loves the 1998 film, but also worried when seeing the hate for the film and for the lead actress. When seeing 'Mulan', it didn't actually strike me as a live action remake and doesn't have an awful lot of Disney in sight. Other than the title and references to the score of the 1998 film embedded in this one. Instead to me it came over as more another version of the character and her story, and one more serious and less family friendly, so directly comparing the two films didn't strike me as right. While the disappointment that is expressed is understandable, as there are big flaws to be found and it definitely does not have the same amount of charm, heart and thrills as the 1998 film, to me 'Mulan' was not that bad and was not deserving of the extreme backlash before it was even released. Seeing as Yifei Liu's personal views had/have nothing to do with Disney or the film crew. 'Mulan' is not perfect. Do agree with those that say that a lot of the dialogue is pretty bad, with a tendency to sound stilted, especially in the cringe-worthy and very out of place attempts at sporadic humour with the troops, and go too heavy on emphasising the characters' values. Loyal, brave and true agreed did not need to be emphasised so much, the point was made quite quickly. There are things in the plot that sounded oddly intriguing on paper, but done too little with. Especially with the phoenix, which doesn't really add anything. Both Xianniang and Bori Khan felt like underdeveloped characters. The former comes off better as she is suitably mysterious and alluring, but her motives are pretty confused later on (with it being not clear what side she was on), she is pretty much a come and go plot device and her final scene felt very rushed. Bori Khan has an intimidating look but is underused and his motivation is pretty much the only thing that is learnt about him. Didn't like how easily defeated he was and how clumsy the scene looked. In general the characters could have done with more depth, Mulan and Zhou are the ones that come closest, and the film could have done with more soul. However, 'Mulan' does look great, especially striking in the truly exquisite historical visuals and the at its best majestic scenery. There is a lot of colour and atmosphere in the photography, which was clearly inspired by the likes of Zhang Yimou, and the costumes do catch the eye. The CGI didn't seem too excessive and didn't look jarringly cheap either. Harry Gregson-Williams' score is stirring and also has a sumptuous emotional core, also enjoyed hearing references to the music from the 1998 film. Niki Caro on the most part directs with confidence. Personally really was impressed by the beautifully choreographed and dynamically photographed action. When it needed to be tense it was, when it needed to be particularly athletic it was and when it needed to excite it did. Especially the big battle and the avalanche. It was easy to feel the strength, pain and perseverance needed to get through all that training, only the final showdown came over as ridiculous. The story was not perfect but it engaged enough, intrigued with the cultural aspects and inspired thanks to Mulan still being a strong character (though she doesn't grow as much or go on a character journey as much as the animated Mulan, if to briefly compare). Although the father-daughter reunion was more emotionally powerful previously, it is still quite moving in a subtle way here. Moreover, the acting wasn't bad at all to me. Liu is a confident lead, bringing authority and vulnerability to Mulan that was ideal for this ideal heroine. Donnie Yen and Jet Li are strong authority figures and Jason Scott Lee does inject some menace into his underdeveloped role. Tzi Ma's performance is very telling in its nuance, more than once not even saying a word. Li Gong looks wonderful in the film and is both deceptively alluring and mysterious, despite the character herself is not meaty Gong's acting is quite complex. In conclusion, prepared myself to hate it but quite liked it while finding it very flawed. 6/10","MAR 22, 2022",6,Adventure

It is also necessary to point out the rushed development of the story, the lack of charisma of the supporting characters and, of course, the boringness and cliché that the phoenix means.

Mulan,"With extreme ease I can say that Mulan is to this day the most ambitious film of all the films that Disney has remade in live action. The scale, staging, colors, details and setting easily put it on a higher level. The trailers already showed some of it but seeing it in the finished film lets you appreciate the attention to detail in a better way. Speaking about the film, I can say that I really enjoyed the first part, with the elements it took from the animated film and because it keeps a nice pace that feels pleasant and fun. However, once the middle of the film is over and on its way to the third act, the film loses its compass, and when I say that, it's not that it becomes a bad film but that it becomes somewhat cartoonish. Perhaps the weight of staying true to the ease with which things get fixed up in an animated film. The way she accepts her destiny, the way she accepts that she's a woman in the Imperial army, that feels a bit forced because of the way the film pushes that plot development so quickly. The final course, the final battle, that personality twist of one of the villains, it feels forced. I didn't like that it doesn't feel organic, that frustrated me a lot. Without a doubt, it's a fantasy story and also this never stops being a Disney film but that's a problem by itself because in the conflict Disney bets on the easy show, the Marvel kinda show, so it lost points in my eyes for it. Liu Yifei does a good job, although I feel like they didn't give her much to work with. I feel like the script didn't give her much to explore with the character and it's a shame. The film is totally hers, there's no doubt about that because of the rest of the cast frankly all are merely supportive, none leaves an impression with the exception of Donnie Yen and that's me being benevolent. I mean she's not a great actress, but anyway I feel the film didn't allow her to explore the character in the best way, although I blame this more on the script than on her because it's clear that she did take the role seriously and worked with what it was provided. I do think it was a sad thing to see the film ending up on Disney +, both for what it means for movie theaters and for the fact that it diminishes the film in a huge way. Don't forget, this is a 200 million dollars blockbuster, and I honestly, would've loved to see it on theaters but today, beyond the cost of renting it, ending up in the service that way, makes it feel disposable. About the changes between the animated film and this one, to tell you the truth, some of the complaints seems ridiculous to me, mainly because people has to understand something: This is supposed to be different, if you really want to see the exact the same thing, then go watch the animated one. Of the rest I can only reaffirm that I think that of all the live action films that Disney has released of its animated classics, this is the one that I've enjoyed the most. Because the truth is that until now, none of them has made me say: '' Oh wow, it was wonderful. '' And this one didn't do it either, but I think it's the one that completed the circle in a more satisfactory way despite its defects, and maybe when the time comes, I will add it to my collection. And if you're **** about the price. Well, **** to be poor.","SEP 7, 2020",6,Adventure
Mulan,"Positive: Good cinematography. Negative: Lacks the level of love and joy as the original, most of the movie seems overly mechanical and dry. Mulan's character is also less relatable. Characteristics & flaws that humanized Mulan in the animated version are lacking in the live action version.","SEP 4, 2020",4,Adventure
Mulan,"First the good: The cinematography is beautiful, no doubt. The soundtrack is good as well, albeit without thinking about the musical aspect of the 1998 animation. The bad: By trying to please everyone, the director has efficiently managed to create a movie which feels distinctly flat, without any heart or emotional connection to the characters on screen. The screenwriters misspelled ""Mongolians"" as well (they didn't, but it's just so damn stupid). There is no real feeling of impending doom like in the 1998 animation, and the dark scenes to establish the ruthlessness of the Khan, are gone. With the inclusion of ""Chi"" they have also effectively removed the fundamental message of the whole tale. Mulan is just the best at everything because reasons, it's weird. The character display some nonsensical reasoning as well, which I won't spoil, but holy damn, there are some encounters which are just straight up badly written. In summation: The movie is questionably written, without any real heart, and feels like the 1998 animation, if the animation had had a lobotomy.","SEP 5, 2020",4,Adventure
Mulan,"As it's own thing, this movie is a mixed bag, as a recreation of the novel, I still feel this movie is a mixed bag. The Art Direction and soundtrack is incredible, and I think, visually, this film stands on it's own merits. But everything else is trite at best and annoyingly cliche at worst. The symbolism in some scenes is so one the nose at times, I rolled my eyes whenever that happens. Mulan's conflict isn't protecting her family by taking her father's place in the army, now it's ""I need to accept myself as I am, and not hide behind the Identity of a man to be viewed as strong."" I found it jarring to constantly see how she has constant power over others, and not having any weakness other than her own lack of confidence being the only obstacle in her way in the film. I will say now, It's really NOT a terrible movie, but the lack of conflict and reliance on western belief systems feel less like Mulan from the book or the Movie.","JUN 4, 2021",5,Adventure

Mulan,"I wish metacritic can clean up some political reviews, it has nothing to do with this movie itself. If you want to support HK, go to social media not a movie rating website I think most Disney movie are falling into a serious problem about ""creating strong female characters"".(star wars, frozen, captain marvel, etc) I'd loved to see female characters pop up on the big screen, however not Disney's formula. All four movie (mulan, star wars, frozen, captain marvel) has its main character ""gifted"" with power, however, there is always a evil male character telling them they needs to be ""that good girl"" in their thoughts. Then at certain point, the fema character realized she needs no one and unleashed the inner power. The problem here is, there is no reason for them to change, and since they are ""gifted"", they can suddenly become super powered like turning on a switch, which makes the story mary sue. How our kids can relate on such story, when the movie is trying to tell them you can only be a hero when you are gifted. The original mulan is a very good movie.","SEP 5, 2020",5,Adventure

Mulan,"It's incredible to think that this film respects the classic story of Mulan more than the 1998 film. But I still think that this re-adaptation is a boring story full of cringe moments. I even find it funny that with Disney's new philosophy (seeking to promote minorities and promote women) they made Mulan a type of all-powerful character, without flaws who was taught to hide his virtues. Sure, there is a message behind all that, but I don't think it is the most appropriate message in these types of circumstances. I think the animated movie has a better message, Mulan is just an ordinary girl who is given the “wonderful” task of just being a wife (like in the 2020 movie). The difference is that in the animated film Mulan was that, an ordinary girl who, with hard work, support between herself and her peers, overcomes that gender barrier and becomes a respected woman throughout China. But in this adaptation she is a woman with super powers that hides them because she is a woman, she doesn't have to work hard to be the best, she already is... again because she is a woman. Her companions who are a very important part of the first film are treated as characters and filler in this film and are pushed aside, even her love interest seems a little forced and not at all natural and organic. She was reading an interview with the director where she argued that having removed Mushu was for two reasons. One was that they wanted the relationships between the soldiers to be more natural and organic with Mulan (it's strange, because you don't even care about those characters, they are flat and outside of a conversation while they eat they don't contribute anything to the story or the character development with Mulan) and two... the Chinese market did not like Mushu and since the Chinese market is the largest market today, you have to do what the client orders. I criticize Shan Yu (villain of the 1998 film) for lacking personality and replace him with two villains lacking personality. Where the “witch” really has no other reason for being than to be like a dark version of Mulan but without a transcendent reason other than that I am like this because…. I am a woman and they look down on me. The khan (I really don't remember his name) is horrible, he has nothing that makes me care about his history (if he has one) and his reason for going to attack is... because he killed my dad. Visually speaking, she is pretty, she has great landscapes and the clothing and armor are incredible. The story, although the source is more respected, is boring, slow and with boring action sequences. If you want to see a better representation of Mulan and powerful women within “Hollywood” martial arts cinema, watch Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and you will see an empowered Asian woman without having the word feminism written like it does today.","SEP 6, 2020",5,Adventure

I believe if Mulan were real, this Mulan portrait by Yifei is much more real. Obviously, real Mulan wouldn’t have Mushu with her. Mulan is a story about a girl disguised as a man trying to survive in military and defending her country.

Mulan,"A travesty in film form. Disney have absolutely perfected their method of taking their best work and reducing it to its worst possible version. I cannot understand why they changed so much of it. Mulan is already a superhero. She is literally born perfect with magic abilities. No flaws, no problems, and no issues to deal with except for being too awesome as apparently being a superhero just isn't proper for a lady. There really is nothing to this character. She doesn't have to develop or confront any obstacles. She just becomes even more awesome. The original Mulan was clumsy, free spirited, clever, loving, caring, and loyal to her family. She tried her best to be the daughter that her parents and society wanted her to be, even if it wasn't who she was. The scene in the Match Maker's ceremony gives makes us empathise with her. We know this isn't what she's meant for, but seeing her try and fail makes us want her to succeed in her inevitable adventure. In this abomination they had to invent a sister for her to be the clumsy one (can't have Mulan be not perfect), and when chaos erupts she breaks out the super powers and perfectly catches tea cups with grace, poise and elegance - exactly what the Match Maker is apparently wanting. But she fails because she's too **** does that even make sense? Anyway, the army comes along and conscripts her father. She talks about it at dinner and her father suddenly turns from this chill encouraging character into a table thumping ""back in the kitchen, woman"" dude...which makes no sense. We all know what happens next. Solemn contemplation, a storm brews, lightning crashes, epic music, she takes her father's armour and sword, cuts her hair, and suits up and ****. We get a camera cut and it's done. THE BEST MOST SYMBOLIC, EPIC AND HARD HITTING SCENE IN THE ENTIRE FILM REDUCED TO A 2 SECOND CAMERA TRANSITION. Honestly at that point it was obvious was we were in for. Do yourselves a favour, just watch the original. There is no life to this movie. There is no emotion, no empathy, no epic swell of satisfaction, no humour. It may be colourful and well shot but it's like sprinkling rainbow sprinkles on a grey cake made out of newspaper. It's also hard to comment on the lead actress' acting, as I'm not convinced she did any. I felt more emotion in the sand scene between Anakin and Padme in the Star Wars prequels. Remember young girls and women, to be accepted as you are you must be born with superpowers and be perfect from your first breath. You must never fail, you must succeed and be the best at absolutely everything and never have to try. This is the message of this film.","JUN 7, 2021",2,Adventure

It's so simple. You have to be a extremely bad writer/director/producer to make something so great so bad. It's also extremely unethical to take someone's life's work and change the source material with such disrespect. Then, just to make everything so much worse, you add on top of that fan baiting. Fan Baiting is done on purpose to not only stir up controversy for publicity but also serves as a barrier to real criticism and ensures that the show will succeed because if anyone has a different opinion, they will just be labeled as a ""racist/sexist/transphobe/etc."" and their opinion is ignored. It's a method to make everyone think you're virtuous when really you're just a horrible person spreading hate with anyone who has a different opinion than your own.

Wonder Woman 1984,"E-Value: 7 Acting: 9 Plot: 5 Originally slated to released in the late 2019, Wonder Woman 1984 had some delays due to needing more time to complete the film and going through the COVID-19 pandemic where theatres are closed down all over the world. After some setbacks, the ninth instalment of DC Extended Universe (which is now the official name of the franchise) has finally arrived before the end of the 2020. The movie is available to watch in some theatres that are open and in HBO Max at the same time. 66 years after the events of the first film, Diana Prince/Wonder Woman (Gadot) have moved to Washington D.C. and working as senior anthropologist at the Smithsonian Institution. During work, she meets a woman named Barbara Ann Minerva (Wiig), who is an insecure woman who comes to idolise her but also envy her as well. After stopping the mall heist, Diana and Barbara identified one of the stolen antiquities called Dreamstone. Unknown to each other, Diana uses the stone by wishing to bring her deceased her lover, Steve Trevor (played by Chris Pine). His soul then inhabits another man’s body. Barbara also uses the stone by wishing to become like Diana which grants her superpowers and godhood. Later, an oil tycoon named Maxwell Lord (Pascal) stole the Dreamstone, an object he have been searching for a long time, during a party at Smithsonian Institution. Hoping to use power of the stone to save his company, he absorb the stone and gain the power to grant wishes to people while also able to take whatever he wants from the others. Not only he becomes an influential figure, he also creates chaos and destruction in his wake as his powers trigger worldwide instability and conflict. Unlike the first film, this movie is less superior than its predecessor. For the good parts, the casts’ performance are great. Gal Gadot and Chris Pine have great chemistry with each other just like the first film. Their acting is great as in the first film. As for Kristen Wiig, I have doubt at first on whether or not she can play a villain character in this movie. Having seen her acting in this one, I can say she has done a great job. Let’s not forget about Pedro Pascal. He really plays a great villain and at the same time as sympathetic character. Wonder Woman’s character arc in this movie remain true to her character as established in the first film. Now for the bad parts of this movie. The movie have less action scenes compare to the first film which is almost comparable to 2006’s Superman Returns which the movie suffered the same thing. This cause the movie to have some boring scenes. In addition, the fighting scenes were kind of a letdown. The story in this movie is notably weaker. Just like Bird of Prey from earlier this year, the story does not lead up to anything. Not a single one hint of sequel or to another event that set up a future movie. Despite this, Patty Jenkins did her best not to do too much of sequel baits which I think it is fine since doing too much sequel baits hurt a film a lot. While this movie is not superior to its predecessor as I have mentioned earlier, this movie is still good enough to watch. It is still very much better than 2016’s Suicide Squad and 2017’s Justice League. Overall, Wonder Woman 1984 is not great but it is not terrible either. I still recommend to watch the movie. If possible, try to watch this movie in your local theatres if they are open and then watch it again in HBO Max. Unless if no theatres are no open nearby at you place, HBO Max is your only option. For international, do your best to watch the movie in theatres that are open. One last thing, stay back for a mid-credits scene for a surprise.","MAR 13, 2021",7,Adventure

Teaches good morals and its refreshing to have a Super Hero movie without everyone trying to kill each other. there really is no ""Bad Guy"" just 3 different people all with extremely different opinions and views. the final ""Fight"" scene is actually a really powerful scene where Diana is confronting Maxwell Lord and she begs him to listen to her. that's a great scene.

Wiig at least feels less like she is phoning it in as the movie goes on. Pedro Pascal (the Mandalorian) Maxwell Lord though feels like a villain of the week. The films strength is the chemistry of Gal Gadot and Chris Pine. As well as just Gal Gadot period. The weakest aspect is the plot that really isn’t worthy of Gadot’s Wonder Woman. The movie isn’t bad though. Since despite being too long. It isn’t an overlong bleak mess, like Batman v Superman.

Yes ill admit there were some dull and corny scenes during the movie, Probably trying to pay homage the Lynda carter WW, but it was a solid movie. that deserves the 7.5. Pros: - Awesome fight scenes. half of the movies fight scenes was awesome - The chemistry between cast members - Pedro pascal performance as Maxwell lord - Maxwell lord is a much better villian than Ares. Possible the greatest in the DCEU. - That Beautiful Lie scene was... well Beautiful. - the last half of the second act and the entire third act was amazing - that Lynda Carter cameo Cons: - cheesy Fight scenes. the other half were not so great. - CGI was a step down then to what the DCEU has offered us. - Plot holes. There were some serious plot holes that dont add up to BVS that well. Primarily the fact that WW could fly in this and not in BVS or Justice League. Overall: despite its issues its a real good movie that doest deserve all the hate it gets. though by Patty Jenkins standards this could be considered a let down.

If there are common themes to various super-heroes, the search and promoting of empathy in Wonder Woman's journey is subtly and beautifully depicted in this heartwarming film. It reminds me of Spider-Man 2 in a very positive way, as it seems like every character is a crucial element of the hero's story, and not just another box to check. It also makes a lot of sense, then, that the main villain is this megalomaniac with a Napoleon complex who is, paradoxically, a complete failure in his personal life. As far as story goes, I was very positively surprised. But this movie also exhibits great pacing and exciting action scenes, that felt refreshingly organic. The grandiose directing and score put the cherry on the top. Great action movie with a carefully crafted script.

Wonder Woman 1984,"I don't normally write film reviews but after reading both critics and audience articles that totally tore WW1984 to pieces, I decided to argue in favour of a film I personally enjoyed. I absolutely loved WW84 and the first thought I had a soon as I walked out of the cinema was that I actually liked it more than the first one. It is brave, humane, heart-warming, compassionate and full of positive elements. Patty Jenkins does an exceptional job at creating the character of Diana Prince/Wonder Woman. She finally brings to life the heroine Marston (WW comic's creator) always intended. He believed women were more honest than men so Antiope teaches a young Diana that 'No true hero is born from lies'. Wonder Woman is fearless, strong, independent, compassionate and she sacrifices her own happiness for a greater good. She empowers herself and she fights the enemy in the way a woman would: not with sword and shield but with warm and compassionate words. Love over violence! Even though Diana is a demi-God, has the same weaknesses and flaws of any woman so she doesn't feel like that superhero out of reach but a character any woman could relate to. Wonder Woman is the ultimate heroine! While her antagonist Maxwell Lord in the beginning appears to be a sinister megalomaniac villain, at the end reveals himself to be a troubled soul who's only trying to make his son proud. Pedro Pascal's interpretation is absolutely breath taking, truly humane and touching. He is the real star of this film. On the other hand, Kristen Wiig plays Barbara Minerva a character that, in my opinion, represents so many women who try to change who they are in the attempt of being more successful and more likable. But by doing so they completely erase their real self and lose their inner beauty. Barbara Minerva wishes to be more like her friend Diana, beautiful, extrovert and strong but the more she becomes like her the more she loses empathy, warmth and kindness until she finally turns into Cheetah. Speaking of which, I have to say I am aware that comic's fans were disappointed by Max Lord and Cheetah because their depiction is not faithful to the graphic novels and I totally understand how they feel. However, I believe Patty Jenkins and the other scrip writers have done a brilliant job re-adapting these characters not only to fit in a modern narrative but these characters also embody fears and insecurities we all face at some point in our life. The only real flaw I found in the film is a plot hole in the scene where Steve Trevor flies a modern jet but, considering he was a WWI pilot, it is not clear how he learned to do that. I know we are talking about a fantasy film but it still has to be coherent. In conclusion WW84 is a film packed with action, very good acting, it is entertaining, humane, heart-warming, full of positive messages and Hans Zimmer nailed the score once more.","MAR 8, 2021",10,Adventure

As such, modern audiences balked at the film. It is literally a film that subvert expectations. Why an 8 from me?

I get she was going for an 80s style of camera work and aesthetics which is fine if done right, majority of the time it is but sometimes it’s a bit overblown and gets dragged to the forefront more than it needs to be. the problem is the plot in my opinion. It’s drags at times and it really feels a bit dumbed down without solid creativity. Theirs a few bright spots, fight scenes are okay but they don’t make Wonder Woman feel like the bad ass she is. Pedros character is alright, I feel like he would have been a better side character though. I’m giving it a 6/10 for the bright spots, it’s an easy to follow movie that does at the minimum have a cohesive story.

Wonder Woman 1984,"WW1984 starts off with a really strong first half hour. Strong character introductions, an exciting and fun flashback, reflection by the protagonist, and earned callbacks to previous films in the DC franchise. Fun stuff. Then, the movie takes a sharp nosedive into the absurd. Coincidences abound, completely unexplained motivations, bizarre reveals, and uncomfortable dialogue riddles the second act and by the time Wonder Woman hits you with its biggest action scene, you feel completely overwhelmed with just how many utterly absurd and annoyingly ridiculous things had to happen to get the characters to the setting for their fight. I really wanted to like this movie, and honestly, I'd watch the beginning of it again through the lens of a failed pilot episode. Overall, WW1984 falls flat, to the point where I think a third film wouldn't even be able to save the reputation of the second by cleaning up its mess. The series should be dead with the sequel, as Wonder Woman's second solo film has made this iteration of the character completely unsalvageable.","JAN 24, 2021",4,Adventure

The effects of her jumping onto buildings like Spider-Man and when she don't have them, holding onto lightning bolts are from b-series tv movie. High heels shoes don't look good on her when she's running. The romantic and comedy scenes between Diana and Steve are very childish and absurd, not adult at all, the whole movie in general. There are scenes reminiscent of Batman from Schumacher. Invisibility is pulled up their sleeve without any explanation, it does it because the script says. The theme of ""I don't need a man to be happy"" is absurd and contradicts itself in the same movie, because she has been sad for decades for having lost her love. There are cameras even in the mall, however they enter the White House as if nothing, without any security. The villains are much better than in the previous installment led by great actors. The treatment of men is worse than in Birds of Prey. The action scenes are very good and the movie is not bad, but it has many flaws.

Wonder Woman 1984,"I had huge expectations for WW84, unfortunately the film did not keep all of its promises. Most of the problem lies in the writing, where the first film excelled and this one failed. The plot is too weak and inconsistent. There are some plot points and plot holes that sting: - electricity for Cheetah, - characters who magically appear at the right time, - Steve doesn't have a passport?? - Steve who doesn't know how to take an escalator even though he can pilot a plane with 70 years of new technology The actors are great, they fulfilled their roles perfectly. More particularly Pedro Pascal who is an excellent Maxwell Lord. Kristen Wiig was also not bad but on the other hand I think her character of Barbara was not used well enough, unless she can come back in WW3 it will remain a wasted character. I was disappointed because I had high expectations from this film and also because WW is my favorite character. I have a lot to say about it but I have to admit that the first two scenes (Games & Mall) are just incredible. Hans Zimmer's score is incredible (Themyscira, Games, 1984, Black Gold, Cheetah, Open Road, White House, Radio Waves, etc.) I've been listening to the album on repeat since its release.

The acting was fine but the pacing, the effects, and the very iffy message didn't make up for what could have been. It also didn't make any sense...like at all. When watching superhero movie, it's easy to forget about suspension of disbelief but when watching this movie, there's just so much of it that it's like the directors were trying to make it incomprehensible in a good way but instead made a confusing, muddled mess. Also the message that Patty Jenkins was trying to convey in this movie was a reasonably fine message but can be viewed in so many different ways that it's hard to know what the message actually is, and many people having watched this movie can very easily take the message the wrong way and...something could happen because of that.

Wonder Woman 1984,"Gal Gadot returns as Diana Prince in “Wonder Woman 1984” which has seen its release date shift a few times due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The film has started to open overseas and will arrive in the U.S. on Christmas day with a limited debut on HBO Max as well. The story sees Diana now living in Washington D.C. in 1984. Diana is popular but has refused male companionship as she still longs for her late love Steve Trevor (Chris Pine). Diana works in the Smithsonian Institute in antiquities and keeps her secret identity under wraps even when a daring mall heist forces her to leap into action. A shy and passive employee named Barbara (Kirsten Wiig); who is afraid of her own shadow and largely ignored by her peers is befriended by Diana and they discover one item from the heist is inscribed with the ability to grant a wish. Unknowingly Diana wishes for Steve to return and Barbara wishes to be more like Diana which sets a chain of events into motion. A shady business man named Maxwell Lord (Perdro Pascal) has his site on obtaining the relic as he believes having the ability to grant wishes will allow him to save his failing business and give him the power he craves. With such a promising setup; the film ultimately does not deliver on its premise and becomes bogged down in drawn out sequences with surprisingly little action and gaps in logic that defy even standards for a comic book film. The first 90 minutes of the film has roughly 10-15 minutes of action tops and we are instead given lengthy scenes of Steve trying to find an 80s fashion look; flying over fireworks, and Maxwell trashing from one locale to another without much needed continuity. An action scene involving a convoy chase through the desert seems very inspired by “Raiders of the Lost Ark” and ultimately does not deliver especially with such a long gape between the action sequences. The final act does attempt to redeem the film as seeing Barbara transform into her new persona is interesting and Wiig does a very solid job with the role. This sadly is undermined with a single line of dialogue which takes away a big part of the transformation that audiences deserved to see. There was also a sequence where Diana races down the streets and takes to flight with her Lasso and then discovers she can fly like Superman. Not only is this not in keeping with the character; but we see this extended fast moving sequence where she is clearly heading away from D.C. at great speed only to arrive at a destination with an item which had been established to be back at her home in D.C. It is this sort of sloppiness that really detracts from the film. There is also the fact that Steve has to fly her around on a jet that even as a pilot he should not know how to fly as he has never flown a jet aircraft in his life. When the big confrontation comes it is a letdown as it is not overly epic and the CGI really does not seem to mesh. What is an even bigger disappointment is that a certain character stands emoting for several minutes while Diana gives such a bland and extended speech that even my wife had to ask “who wrote these lines”. The film was not a total disaster as the characters were interesting and worked well with one another making the film entertaining in parts despite being really disappointed with it. The film strikes me as a product of the talented Patty Jenkins being able to do whatever she wanted after the success of the first film. Jenkins not only Directed but did the screenplay for it. Considering the amazing job she did writing “Monster” I had high expectations for the film but to me it seemed like it could have used a bit more attention to several aspects. My summary would be the following… good cast, entertaining in parts, not much action over two hours, takes huge liberties with Diana and her abilities, massive gaps in logic even for a comic movie. It aims to be epic and comes up lacking. At least the mid. credit scene was worth it. 3 stars out of 5","JAN 29, 2021",6,Adventure

Wonder Woman 1984,"Wonder Woman fights two people in this movie, one guy who grants wishes and a cat girl(?). There are so many mistakes in the movie that I wonder if the writer was a grown-up. First of all, the worst villain ever cames from this movie. Explaining the concept of the ""wish guy"": he thouches a wish stone and say he wants to BE the wish stone. So people who touches him can make a wish and it becomes true. Looks great at first, but eventually the guy does just like Jim Carrey in Bruce Almighty. But instead of ruining Buffalo, the villain here ruins the world! Even after he sees a chaos bad enough AND big enough, he keeps going, like he didn't care about the consequences. The reason of it? I don't know... If you understand that, please tell me! That being said, let's begin the other insane mistakes of WW84. Diana wishes to be with her romantic partner from the first movie, who has died. So for the wish becomes true the writer came up with a ""realistic"" solution (but end it up being insane instead). The ""great"" solution was to put the mind of the dead caracter in the body of a random dude. (What happened with the real guy's mind? His consciousness was trapped in a dark place for I don't know how long? Really?) My question is, if the concept of the movie is not realistic, if a woman during the film becomes a tiger person, if the jet becomes invisible, if so many insane things happened, what was the problem with making the dead guy appears from nowhere? The Jet? Oh yeah, the invisible jet happens (Wow) but everything about this part is laughable! First of all it gets invisible and it disappears from the radar. Seriously? No-one around though about the concept of the radar? It flies just as fast as a normal plane. (Wtf?) Not to mention the jet was already filled up, laing on the airport for no reason. Watch and take your conclusion, or your laugh. Oh, I remembered more wishes problems. At first, each person can only do one wish ever, than, the second villain was able to do a second wish, for pure convenience of the movie (just a few scenes before one guy was anable to make a wish because he has already made one in the morning hahaha) The concept is that you need to touch the villain to get your wish done, right? Well, not at all... By pure convenience again, this is forgotten or changed (maybe it was explained but I didn't care for). Even so, no reason is plausible for changing this ""rule"". Oh, I just remembered Wonder Woman whispering in the floor, with no mic, in the back of a TV scenario and her voice beeing transmitted either way HAHAHAH. The biggest mistake of the movie, in my opinion, happened lasting like 40 or 50 minutes. The bad guy TOUCHES the good guy AND SAYS: WHAT DO YOU WANT? I swear to God that I pause the movie right there to think about it. I couldn't believe the script made this villain THAT stupid. But than I looked at the screen and realized that this wasn't the end, because it had 40 or 50 minutes afterward... I'm sad for this scene untill now.

She is strong yes, but the beauty of the first one was that she wasn't perfect, she had to grow, as a character and in her powers, in this one seems like she has nothing to learn anymore, and that the only thing that is stopping her are memories and that she has to let them go.

Wonder Woman 1984,"I'm guessing that after the poor critical response of Batman v Superman and the critical acclaim of Wonder Woman, Warner Bros must have thought of something any layman would have thought of at first glance: Zack Snyder cannot make Wonder Woman as nicely as Patty Jenkins can. So this time only Patty Jenkins was around to make this. This movie came on Prime yesterday and I finished it just now, so everything is still fresh in my memory. First of all, let's get the praises done with. This movie has amazing CGI and the action scenes are pretty well choreographed. With that said, let's move on to all the problems with this movie. The beginning of the problems is Wonder Woman herself. First of all, her costume is way too bright. I think they probably reused the same costume that they used in Batman v Superman, Wonder Woman and Justice League. Since those movies had a darker colour palette, the bright costume was needed so that the costume's colours would be visible even after the bleak filter. Here however, she stands out of the crowd, something like a cosplayer. Secondly, in this movie Wonder Woman looks way too weak. In the previous movies she ran super fast and dodge bullets easily. She could rip guns without breaking a sweat. Now she actually gets hurt by bullets, gets blown away by a little wind and needs to use her full strength to break a simple lock. It's quite contradictory because in the beginning of the movie she is shown to toss away a speeding car by simply shanking it. Also her powers are very vague, but I will come to that point later. The next big problem is the story. It's literally Bruce Almighty's plot (or God Tussi Great Ho if you're an Indian like me XD): Everyone gets their wishes granted which causes chaos in the world. Initially everything seems to be fine but slowly bad people start asking for bad things and now the whole world in on a brink of a nuclear war. So now everything has to be restored back to normal. And for that Wonder Woman has to let Steve die because he also came back to life because of her wish. This is what we call a superhero's sacrifice. And finally the problem that bothers me very much - the plot holes in this movie. The idea that an artefact can make anything come true immediately is kinda unbelievable, especially if it's something like having more nuclear missiles or asking all the Irish people to be deported. There should have been some random events happening which finally lead to the consequences. I would have believed this if it was a Doraemon episode, but this is a movie that belongs to the same cinematic universe as Man of Steel or the prequel, Wonder Woman itself. Like I said, Wonder Woman's powers are also very vague. And she gets them for no reason whatsoever. Just as she walks away from Steve, she suddenly gains the power to fly. It's impossible to tell whether she's flying or falling with style. She also swings on lightning bolts because why not. When she lands, she is wearing the Kingdom Come suit. Don't ask when she changed the costume. She uses her lasso to spin it around so fast that it can block bullets, but she can't use it to grab Max Lord immediately in the end. Speaking of Max Lord, why does wind start blowing when Max Lord starts granting everyone's wishes? What was the need for that to happen? Even Cheetah's creation was so ambiguous. ""I want to be different from everyone else, like an apex predator."" - who talks like that? Her motivations were also not clear at all. She became strong like Diana, yes, but what now? Yes she lost her humanity, but that doesn't mean she should become insane. She could just be a normal person who doesn't care about anyone. Now I haven't read the comics so I don't know if this is the actual story from the comics, but they should have altered the story to fit in more with the tone, like how Harvey Dent was in The Dark Knight or Joker in, well, Joker. Alistaire was also a cliched ""innocent child"" who just wants daddy to come back home. And all the bad incidents that take place look so forced. It's almost like everything was deliberately made to go bad, like some Phineas and Ferb episode. Most importantly, what was the whole point behind making this movie? No character development takes place, no big incident happens, no new character is introduced (the ones introduced are then abandoned). Out of everything that ever happens in it, the only major event is that Wonder Woman can now fly, which is something that could be introduced in some other movie also. It doesn't matter whether you like Zack Snyder or not, this movie is the final proof that removing him from DCEU was a mistake, even though it didn't seem like that before. While trying to remove the serious tone, they made it super childish. This movie is to Wonder Woman what Superman IV: The Quest for Peace is to Superman or Batman & Robin is to Batman. I hope DCEU doesn't make this mistake again.","MAY 16, 2021",3,Adventure

While the first act may feel a bit slow, the pacing quickly ramps up and keeps the audience thoroughly engaged. The film excels in developing the relationship between Miles Morales and Gwen Stacy, delivering heartfelt moments that deepen their connection. However, the only drawback is the sense of being left unfulfilled at the end, as this is just part one of the story. Nevertheless, with its stunning animation, engaging plot, and well-crafted character dynamics, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse is a must-watch for fans of the franchise.","NOV 22, 2023",8,Animation
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,"""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is a triumph in both storytelling and animation, weaving a multiverse-spanning tale that captures the essence of the Spider-Man mythos while pushing the boundaries of visual creativity. This animated masterpiece, a sequel to the acclaimed ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,"" is a kaleidoscope of artistry and innovation that further cements its place as one of the most remarkable superhero films of all time. The film's narrative brilliance lies in its ability to seamlessly meld heart-pounding action, emotional depth, and comic book sensibilities. The introduction of a multidimensional narrative opens up endless possibilities, allowing different iterations of Spider-People to coexist while deepening our understanding of their struggles and aspirations. This exploration of diverse characters adds layers of complexity to the Spider-Man legacy and resonates with audiences on a profound level. Visually, ""Across the Spider-Verse"" is a tour de force. The animation style remains distinct and groundbreaking, seamlessly blending 2D and 3D techniques to create a living comic book on screen. Each frame bursts with vibrant colors, dynamic movement, and innovative visual storytelling, evoking the feeling of flipping through the pages of a comic while immersing audiences in a fully realized cinematic experience. Beyond its technical prowess, the film excels in character development and emotional resonance. Miles Morales, the heart of the story, continues to shine as a relatable and inspiring Spider-Man. His journey of self-discovery, growth, and the challenges of embracing his role as a hero form the emotional core of the narrative. The relationship between Miles and his mentor, Peter B. Parker, further explores themes of legacy, responsibility, and the enduring spirit of heroism. The introduction of Gwen Stacy, Spider-Woman, adds depth to the narrative by exploring her universe and experiences. The interactions between the various Spider-People, each with their unique quirks and backgrounds, create a rich tapestry of camaraderie and teamwork that underscores the essence of the Spider-Man ethos – anyone can wear the mask. While celebrating the film's strengths, it's worth noting that its fast-paced narrative and multiverse complexities might occasionally pose challenges for viewers unfamiliar with Spider-Man lore. However, the film's sheer entertainment value and emotional resonance are universally relatable, making it an enjoyable experience even for newcomers to the Spider-Verse. In conclusion, ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse"" is a cinematic gem that pushes the boundaries of storytelling, animation, and superhero narratives. Its multidimensional approach to the Spider-Man mythos is a triumph of creativity and inclusivity, showcasing the potential of the superhero genre to evolve while staying true to its core themes. As it propels audiences across universes, emotions, and spectrums of imagination, the film solidifies its place as an unforgettable contribution to both cinematic artistry and the beloved legacy of Spider-Man.","AUG 30, 2023",10,Animation

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,"I really feel this film is a prime example of style over substance. All the purity the first film had when making use of that characteristic style or using the multiverse topic is lost in this sequel, which being so selfaware, is just concerned of looking good and showing off multiverse-related topics. There are glimpses of thematic and emotional conflict here and there, but it isn't a concern of the film. It losses the emotion but the problem is that it also loses the fun. It's a very atonal film in terms of direction, which doesn't know if it wants to be a comedy or a drama. And the action scenes, which is all the film has, end up falling flat because there's barely any emotional substance to hold it. Besides the plot starts almost one hour in and the film ends with the plot starting to develop. Most characters just feel extremely supporting character, with almost no presence in the film. Good things: the film looks good, the animation is good, the music is fine, the peformances are good, the character design are good and the sequel will probably be good.","DEC 6, 2023",7,Animation
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,"A little gem released by Sony, but with great, huge potential to become part of one of the best animated sagas in the history of cinema. It doesn't matter if you are a superhero fan or not, this film is able to give you EVERYTHING: spot-on soundtracks, the story of every single character, the evolution and growth of Miles but above all of Gwen, the infinite number of cameos and easter-eggs present, attention to every detail, scenes that make you laugh, cry, that keep you in suspense until the end. This film represents **** almost. I say ""almost"" because it only has one flaw: it doesn't have an ending. Sony's choice to move the end of the film into a sequel is on the one hand frustrating, because clearly waiting more than a year, maybe 2, requires a lot of patience, but on the other hand it is a more than right choice, because closing the saga in 2 films was really too much, instead this leaves room for one film, the last one, which can give us something that we can't even imagine, which can turn out to be even more beautiful than this one.","JAN 2, 2024",9,Animation
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,"The sequel turned out to be much stronger than the original. This film has a gorgeous plot that is fun to follow. But there is one problem - there is a lot of clowning. The authors shove this horrible humour into the most inappropriate situations, and it makes you sick to watch. The first 45-50 minutes of the film were absolutely like that and I just wanted to turn it off. But as soon as things got serious the film just transformed and became very cool.","SEP 30, 2023",7,Animation
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,"I am late to the party, I have only watched the film a few days ago. The film is fine, but it's definitely not a 10. Animation is great yes, music is great yes. Attention to details is great yes, and the story has an interesting angle. But first, I will complain about the trailer. Honestly, it felt like i had already seen 90% of the film in the trailer, only i hadn't realized. In the trailer, you can already see that all the Spider-Men are pursing Miles and are trying to stop him, with Miguel leading the charge. So of course, while watching the film, I'm constantly waiting for this plot point to arise. Would you believe that this does not happen until at least 1 hour and a half in? Everything before is just either giving backstory, or positioning the pieces. From there, there's not that much happening. There is a final minor twist at the end (but of course, a youtuber had spoiled that for me too, even though you can see it coming). And suddenly, cliffhanger. So, the cliffhanger deserves some criticism. I don't necessarily mind a cliffhanger in a film, a few movies pull it off well. But here, the movie simply does not solve any of its own plot lines at all and just ends there. Back to the Future 2 also ends with a cliffhanger, but imagine if BTT2 ended before solving the almanach thing? Or imagine Infinity War ending before Thanos uses the gauntlet, or even before he gets the final gem? Or more recently imagine if Spider-Man Far from Home simply ended before the final fight with Mysterio? Those movies would feel much more incomplete, wouldnt they? It's fine to have a cliffhanger with a new story twist to set up the sequel. But not if you forgot to give the movie at least some kind of ending. The movie set up all of those plot points, but none are resolved by the end.","AUG 28, 2023",6,Animation

But the worst thing for children is the disrespect at the end. It's one of the most anticlimactic movies I've ever seen. Many of them were upset when they left the cinema.

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,"Overall, I liked this movie. Giving it a 6 only because of the cop out ending. The aesthetics and animations were absolutely stunning. They really took it to the next level in that regard. Solid character development throughout. Soundtrack was solid again. The only two complaints I have are as follows: 1) Plot - The plot did not have as much consistency as I would have liked. They claim that changing stories or preventing certain things from happening could destroy an entire universe due to it ""messing up the cannon"" of the world. Yet they go around from universe to universe with no issue messing up all kinds of things and cannon. So you can't let one guy die, but can have someone not named Peter Parker be Spiderman and that's totally okay? It made no sense to me. 2) The to be continued ending... That was a serious gut punch to me. I paid for a full movie from start to finish. This reeked of a cash grab to me. Easily could've wrapped up this entire plot with an extra 20 minutes of runtime or so. Now I guess I have to wait another 5 years to see how this finishes? I will not remember everything by then, and I hate rewarding movies that do this with my money so I may not actually go see the follow up. If you're okay with cliff hanger endings I recommend this movie. It's better than 95% of new content out there. I just wish the plot was a bit better.","JUN 2, 2023",6,Animation

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,"Let's start this review with the plot. The consepts of multiple metaverses, Miguel, The Spot and Spider-Man(Woman)'s family problems are cool, but they all were executed as horribly as almost possible, I don’t understand why interruption of cannon event is so harmful to any of spider verses, I mean, how would it even affect anything? For example, if Miles interrupted cannon event of losing his dad or so-called “captain”, how does it affect other things? Because I don’t wanna read comics or whatever to understand why it does and I can’t believe that Miles is the only Spider-Man who tried to prevent cannon event of losing a close person. OK let’s talk about Miguel now, why didn’t he kill Miles immediately after he met him for the first time? But Miguel started to explain how meta verses work to him in almost the smallest detail. I can’t understand his role in the script, as a villain, he was already shown as a positive character, so it's not gonna work out, as an anti-hero, he’s not written good enough and doesn't create uncertainty whether he's evil or just tries to keep the metaverses in order, at first, he seems like a nice guy, but after around an hour, he appears as a possessed person whose actions defy any explanation, he must be bipolar or some other ****, unlike The Spot, he had motivation and good reason to become a villain, he even creates uncertainty whether he’s actually so evil and screenwriters had inorganic opportunities to unleash his potential as a villain, but they all just forgot about his existence in the second part of the movie, now about the family problems, why does Miles struggle to tell his parents that he’s Spider-Man I mean what would they do to him? Nothing bad would happen. Even though there're many scenes with Miles and his parents, they're almost all just worthless and don't broach the sudject of their relashionship good enough. I like the visual aspect of this movie though. And are you telling me that I watched this movie for 2 and a half hours just to get ""To be continued"" at the end? ARE YOU F*CKING KIDDING ME?????","AUG 14, 2023",5,Animation

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,"Good movie but vastly inferior to the first. Unfortunately if you liked Spider pig or the other spidermans from the last movie, you won’t be getting them here despite the movie introducing a plethora of characters who don’t live up to the last movie’s spiderman noire/pigs The movie still maintains that signature style from the first movie although sometimes the colors and flashing lights are a bit chaotic and the movie too heavily focuses on needless action/movement scenes. The tone of the styles also varies widely, some making my eyes hurt. Someone who has epilepsy should 100% not watch this movie. At times I felt like a horde of unicorns were vomiting in my face. Some action scenes go on for way too long with awkward comedic dialogue in between like this first time where they chase the villain who can make holes. It just dragged on and on and just had so many one line quips from this hole guy that just fell flat. I kept waiting for some sort of conclusion or wrap-up but nope, this like everything else in this movie is not concluded. Don’t get me wrong, the action scenes are great but it comes at the expense of the characters. Characters like ‘afro lady’ spiderman and punk spiderman did not connect like spiderpig, noire, etc. Spiderpunk would make cringy lines for modern 2023 audiences along the lines of ‘capitalism bad!’ And afro lady seemed to have only existed so the movie could fill their diversity quota since she had 0 personality and didnt act, dress, or look like anything attempting to be a ‘spider something’. They werent terrible but compared to the contrasting personalities of spider pig and spider noire, these characters just felt uninspired. The end action scene of the film, which can hardly be considered a ‘climax’ unfortunately doesnt make too much sense as it says that it is canon that miles father must die, however the film completely ignores that spiderman’s uncle already died. Spiderman canonically must have some loved one die and they establish this in the first movie too, it does not need to be a captain, so it was awkward and contradicted itself when they tried to shoehorn in that ‘oh yeah miles, your dad will die because he is a captain even though your uncle already died’. What was the point of showing spider gwen and every other spiderman’s dead loved one if you are going to introduce a new concept that two loved ones must die? Why didnt spider gwen care if her captain dad died? Why is it ok that gwen just spontaneously leave her timeline and that has no timeline consequences? Why are all of mile’s spider friends suddenly uncaring a-holes who would try to stop their friend from saving his own dad? I like that peter parker has a baby now but he’s really swinging his toddler around as he does extremely dangerous stuff when this movie establishes over and over the theme of parents protecting their kids. Another awkward addition to this movie for a few attempts to make the audience go ‘awww haha the baby does spiderman stuff too’ Worst of all, the movie opens up three huge plot points and doesnt care to conclude anything! Ok ok we get another movie but at least attempt to finish something. The cliffhanger ending felt like it belonged in a TV show, not a movie that I’m watching in theaters. The movie doesnt even have anything remotely close to a climax. It just ends. When ‘to be continued’ flashed on the screen, i could hear ‘what!?’ And ‘really…’ from people in the theaters. There are good and bad ways to do cliffhangers. The empire strikes back had a cliffhanger but it still had a climax, and still concluded itself in someway to finish this chapter of star wars. Spiderman did not do this and it was just unsatisfactory. They tease a ‘final battle’ w spider pig, noire, etc and it was such a cop out and made me wonder why all of them only decide to show us at the very end. Was every character from the first movie really so indifferent to mile’s problem after they risked their lives to help him in the first movie? If yes, why deteriorate these established characters? Because the writers wrote themselves in a hole and needed to explain why everyone wouldnt just help spiderman, or why any spiderman, many who are pure hearted do-gooders, wouldnt help another spiderman save his dad. I am saying a lot of critical stuff here but only because i love the first movie so much. A special hats off to the excellent soundtrack although sometimes i felt like the movie was made to fit the sound track and not the other way around","JUN 11, 2023",6,Animation

However, it has lost its essence, at least for me, and has dramatically diminished the meaning of the costume. Seeing hundreds of the friendly neighborhood spider all at once, and even worse, all in the same place, erases the character's image as ""the friendly neighborhood spider."" It's entirely absurd in a story where even the Elephant appears as Spider-Man within an intergalactic organization. I was pretty excited when the multiverse idea was first introduced. But it seems that neither What If!, nor Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness or Across the Spider-Verse have been able to provide what I was looking for.

But I still agree with my prior review, the story is not nearly as enthralling or captivating as the first, it has animation that could give you a seizure, and it loves to shove political messages down your throat. watch the first spiderverse and skip this one. Original review from when the movie came out: this movie is terrible. It ruins every good thing to original had going for it and replaces it with absolute trash. remember how good the animation was in the first movie? nope. now it will just give you a headache. do not let anyone with epilepsy see it or they will just straight up die. the main message of the first movie was that anyone can ""be spiderman"" and that anyone can conquer their insecurities and be the good person they've always wanted to. What is the message of this movie? you have no free will. no choice. and your dad is going to die and you should let him. what? this movie so desperately wants to be spiderman 2. but what made spider-man 2 so good was that tobey maguire/peter parker was a likeable character. they take miles from the first film and make him a jerk. this movie is terrible, but I give it a 1/10 because the spot had one good scene. that being where he goes into the collider and miles sees all the horror he will unleash","JUN 4, 2023",4,Animation

It could be that I'm just jaded with the whole multiverse/alternate reality narrative, but this whole movie felt incredibly predictable and kind of obvious as to what would happen next. Great animation for sure, but not enough to make this a must see for me.","JUN 14, 2023",4,Animation
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,"What a letdown. Also idk what is going on with movies this year but this is the second one where there's no ending. (MI Reckoning being other). There's no good reason for it to be this long too. Dialogs are drawn out, action is few and far in between. Diversity for sake of diversity with no plot impact. Too many villains. Unfocused. I rewatched Into the spiderverse before watching this and it had perfect pacing, concise plot, and engaging story. This one is like watching paint dry. Do yourself a favor and wait until it's actually finished.","NOV 3, 2023",4,Animation
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,"I get it, Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse (2018), was like a breath of fresh air to animated movies, with its edgy graphics, bright and zippy colours, cuttng edge music and sound effects, but I differ from the gushing that is going on over the sequel, Spiderman: Across the Spiderverse (currently in Cinemas). I think, the sequel is a victim of the success (critical, commercial and artistic) of the first installment. The producers took that success as licence for what turned out to be the content of the sequel. Four things made this experience unsatisfactory for me. The Opening scene with Gwen was boring and an ill-advised start to the movie; there were numerous scenes that could have been handled in much shorter time periods; there were too many spidermen and timelines (that there are many does not mean so many have to be crammed into one movie). The fourth, was the culmination of the first two, which took up unnecessary time, the story was not concluded in this movie, there is to be a second part. Not good. I will not take away from the movie, the fact that the things that made the first installment an outstanding movie are still there. There are two areas in the movie, where things were moved up a notch from the first; In a scene Miles and Gwen have a full fledged conversation while web-slinging, and then continue the conversation, while stationary but hanging (actually sitting) upside down from a the top of a skyscrapper. My opinion of this movie is mixed.","JUN 7, 2023",6,Animation

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,The animation's nice but the transitions are too much for the average person to comprehend without getting a headache. I don't know if they did it because they want their audience to be hyper-engaged or if it's just a drastic artistic approach. too politically driven. too long for no reason (storywise). music/ost is the only thing worth praising alongside certain camera angle moments,"JUN 26, 2023",5,Animation
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,"The biggest problem of the movie is the political correctness, especially in the beginning. In addition Spider-man was always for teens and I am not that anymore. So sometimes I even wanted to stop the movie and do something else. But the last half of the movie gets better. Just the story is over the top and exaggerated. The art style is interesting though","OCT 29, 2023",5,Animation
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,"I think that since it costs so much time and money to animate, I think they added a lot of parent-child conversations so they didn't have to finish it by leaving it for the next film. There is some action first with the steampunk renaissance vulture, then with the stain with some comic relief, then in India with the Indian spiderman and then fleeing the interdimensional nexus, but really almost all the footage is father-son conversations until a plot twist. Peter Parker Spiderman, the Spiderman who started it all, insists on being comic relief and putting his daughter at unnecessary risk in his flannel dressing gown by going to other dimensions without knowing what risks he will face. The afro Spiderwoman with her motorcycle, which has a brutal momentum and grip, is a bit forced to see her pregnant, dragging the weight of the motorcycle with cobwebs from wall to wall and from building to building. There are moments when the watercolor background with the maudlin parent-child conversation is somewhat soporific. The animation, especially with the Indian Spiderman, seemed wonderful to me. He insists on giving drama and building the characters but Miguel Ohara, Spiderman 2099, presents it to us with nuances such as the music, the elevator, some gestures, the quantity and geometric instability of the screens...we deduce that he is arrogant, an obsessive of control and depressed or emotionally frustrated, but if they were not going to conclude the film by lengthening the footage in a dramatic sense to develop the characters, they could have insisted more on developing the story and the character of this Spiderman 2099","NOV 8, 2023",6,Animation
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,"Technically good, conceptually stale. This movie does humor better than most Marvel films, the action is more similar to the comics and the animation is top notch. It is a little too much flash, visually. It distracts from the plot. The emotional tone fails. The parents are a bore and I'm not even sure there's chemistry between Miles and Gwen now? Its still weighted with agenda driven nonsense as well.

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,"Your favourite heroes are complicit murderers. What? You didn't care for Miles before and only wanted to see the original Spider-Man? Too bad, Peter Parker and all of the other Spider Death Cult members now argue why leaving innocent people, including your father or friend, to die is actually a good thing. No character assassination on a mass scale to be found here. Thank goodness Miles didn't ask if Peter would let his infant daughter die for LE CANON otherwise the audience might have caught on that this premise for these characters is all kinds of stupid. All you need is good animation by crunched artists to convince a Spiderverse audience of your masterpiece. Don't think about how Captain Stacy never died because he got burried under rubble trying to save a child in The Amazing Spider-Man movies. It makes total sense that Spot is creating canon events in the indian Spider-Man world despite being an anomaly, stop thinking. Miles never blew up or damaged his own universe despite being an anomaly but you're just a nitpicker for complaining about how the main narrative and conflict does not make a single ounce of sense. Just get carried by the hollow theme which constantly makes up new strawmen to justify its own narrative. Everyone is just a-ok with murder until Miles, the bestest Spider-Man of them all, comes in to show them that murder even complicit ones your fascist leader told you is fine, is in fact not good. Ben Reilly is a meme character and not a precious good boy in this movie. Twitter told me that is unforgivable. Peter might let his own daughter die because hey the future sometimes also has good things in store but we have to look at the real issues. That **** character from the Clone Saga who died a billion times and became a villain as many times as well was a meme in Across the Spiderverse. Poor Spider-Man fans. We only like real characters like stereotype anime Spider-Man or Nig Cage Reddit Spider-Man who totally are like their comicbook counterparts. Boy oh howdy am I glad there is none of that patented MCU Humor in the film. We only get the best jokes: ""He kicked his OWN LE BUTT xD"" or ""Can you be my mommy?"". Classic stuff. No memes or tone deaf humor in this film. I heckin' love Across the Spider-Verse. I love it when 100 artists leave the film's production because it's hell despite criticising capitalism and exploitation through jokes inside your plot. I love that my favourite characters argue why killing your loved one by ignoring your origin is cool. That is true spirit of Spider-Man. Spider-Man fans are so smart.","JUL 7, 2023",3,Animation
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,"Contains spoilers // This movie has no real plot and can’t resolve any issues across its nearly 2 1/2 hour run time. // So for the first hour we just see weirdly diverse spidermen and women and a guy who can create black holes. Black hole guy has beef with miles over the events of the first movie (probably Peter Parker reincarnated or yet another variant Spiderman - the movie never tells us). We are introduced to what is supposed to be a small team of spider people that ends up being the size of a city. What do they do, why are they necessary, who is guarding their universe? // The second hour fails to introduce us to most of any of the variant spidermen other than surface level intros if that. The geniuses tell miles that his dad has to die and not to save him. Stunning. Miles says F that and he’s going to save his dad. Brave. The spidermen all in unison try to stop him, none of them questioning why they are trying to stop miles. We learn that for some reason miles is not supposed to be Spiderman (which is somehow his fault for existing) and he **** now according to the diverse spider team. // Miles is captured by prowler miles (spooky?) & then nothing happens and the movie ends. // The plot is nothing, the movie tells us nothing, the characters are all grating and annoying.

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,"The art is amazing. Each dimension has it's own art style and and alot of effort has gone into these. And how these art styles mix when the beings from different dimensions share the same space. Two teen super spiders and their core family get the majority of the movies attention and love. Like over half the movie is devoted to these two and their families and this is a very long movie, almost 2 hours 20 minutes. It's well done for the most part at least. Despite that, neither Spider Hero is shown to have the Spiderman compassion even for ""foes"" I've seen in other Spiderman media in their hero work, just stopping anyone from breaking laws even when it would have been better if sometimes they just stayed out of it. Being a Spider hero in this seems more like a police like obligation and not done to genuinely help people. In fact some battles cause significant property damage despite the initial crime being petty, like way more property damage than the amount of money being stolen from a ATM, and Miles doesn't even seem to care. None of them seem to consider how they might help beyond detaining the ""bad guy"". Less than a handful of other characters than those two and family get any significant amount of flesh out though some do have interesting characters anyway. A third character gets their backstory briefly shown for a few minutes, the rest get almost nothing or nothing at all. I wish the character love and run time had been spread around a bit more. But some do have unique interesting characters to match their unique interesting art styles despite their lack of backstory. I really enjoyed the Indian (nation, not native american) dimensional world and character was fun in its small dose. Also the contrarian british character with the barely understandable accent and magazine cut out art was interesting as well. So if I liked the art and the characters,(aside from the lack of hero compassion) why rate it low? The plot is terrible. Plot doesn't really even kick in till past half way but when it does... ugh. It is difficult to explain without spoilers but I will try. Rather than call it ""spider-verse"" or even ""multiverse"" it should be called ""metaverse""(""meta"" means for something to be self referential, like a conversation about conversing with people talking about said conversation). To give a example, Miles calls someone robbing a ATM a ""villain of the week"", which the person finds offense at. Not at being called a ""villain"", which would make sense, how is someone a ""villain"" because they stole a bit of money from a ATM to get by having little other choice? No, its offense at being considered a minor character in the story. Like the story is meta-talking about it being a story and making meta comparison to other Spider hero sources. The plot is about how the plot is suppose to go verses how the character want it to go, they even call it ""canon"", like official plot canon Like the authors are reminding you that this is just a story and that story is suppose to go a certain way. Also they kind of make out average Spider heroes to sort of be villains.","AUG 30, 2023",2,Animation

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,"Watching “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” is the opposite of fun. It’s hard, backbreaking work, and I was bone-tired by the time I dragged myself to my car and sat there, struggling to recall one single memorable moment, image or line of dialog from the two hour and twenty minute incursion. But the vacant nothingness of the dialog, the messy, finger paint incoherence of the imagery and the absolutely nonstop solar plexus punching of the soundtrack had erased itself from my mind like a self-destructing tape loop. I knew I’d been assaulted but I couldn’t pick my attackers out of a line-up.Taking self-referentiality to unimagined depths of sphincteral excavation, “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” never stops hawking the oldies at you.Even I, a relative newcomer to the Spider-Verse, recognized at least a dozen pop culture references. And the audience around me seemed to never stop nodding and sighing as one after another product was trotted out for appreciative acknowledgement.I saw Jan de Bont’s dreadful 1999 remake of “The Haunting” in the theater, and there’s a moment when Catherine Zeta-Jones holds up her bag and said “It’s a Prada!” and the entire audience burst into knowing **** this trend has become Hollywood’s major story-telling shorthand for signaling audience ‘engagement’. The more products you buy, the more sheer enjoyment you’ll get. It’s a game of catching the references: If you want to appear ‘in the know’ you better spend a more time buying things!The plot and characters in “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” are not memorable enough to talk about in any depth. I think there was a joke-cracking villain in a white body suit with black spots all over it. And a bunch of joke-cracking Spider-Men and Women swinging around. And some joke-cracking police chiefs. And a lot of screaming extras (non-player characters) running about while buildings fell on top of **** that’s pretty much **** one very telling — and eye-rollingly ‘meta’ — thread emerged near the end of the movie which made me wonder if writers Phil Lord, Christopher Miller and David Callaham realized they’d written an unauthorized remake of Ira Levin’s “The Boys From Brazil.”It turns out that across the many, dull, insider-y ‘verses’ in the Spider-Verse there are hard and fast ‘rules’ that dominate all the **** in order to transform a dorky teen into a “Spider-Man”, certain events must take place. Including the death of a father figure. As if trauma could only lead to a specific, exact **** “The Boys from Brazil” a **** makes a bunch of **** clones and then recreates all the major events from **** life, hoping to make another Fuhrer. And as silly as the movie was, it had the good sense to understand that no two people are going to respond to an event in the exact same **** in “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse”, this fact is taken as gospel: Of course every teen who loses a dad is going to turn into a superhero, that’s the rule.Whether the writers are doing a self-own by, in effect, admitting to the ridiculously limiting strictures of their own genre, or simply ignorant to how lazy and repetitive this storyline is, the result is cynical and ****’s as if the filmmakers were saying: “That’s right, we’re a cookie cutter.

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,"This movie is completely rubbish. The tactics of those who made this film are obvious: because in the first film, at least in some parts they tried to do something interesting; however, in the second, when they had enough admirers, they began the degenerate process of subversion; there are at least these pathetic things in this film: 1 - Firstly, Gwen, in her room, has a flag with the phrase: ""protects transgender children"" - completely against Nature. Obviously, through teleology we easily rationally recognize that such acts are against Nature. Something going against your biology and nature of being is intrinsically against Nature; one would be disrespecting God, Creation, Metaphysics, and Nature. Something funny is that in the first film Gwen prays before eating, but in the second she goes completely against the Bible. 2 - Gwen's father has the same flag on his shirt. 3 - Miles Morales has a logo: ""#BLM"". So it seems that even in Miles' ""multiverse"", a black criminal died and started the movement. 4-In the Indian part, he insults Great Britain, saying that it stole things from the Indians. Personally, being Portuguese, I don't respect the Englishman because of the pathetic and envious ultimatum he made to us, but even so, such a film has no moral capacity to include insulting propaganda; What this film has done is an unnecessary and pathetic foot-licking attack on Indians. 5 - The number of characters of foreign races is surprising; originally, there are several Spider-Men, and of course the majority are white; however, in this film they made an effort to hunt down and prioritize mainly the few who are not white, but black; In other words, the white majority was set aside, and the few black people were made to have all the main character positions. Oh, and of course, the one considered evil in the film is white (Miguel O'Hara). This is all exactly what you expect when a degenerate group makes a film; the film becomes degenerate; This movie is shit soup. 6 - This film was written by morally incapacitated people. 7 - One of the main guys who made this film is Portuguese; I'm disappointed that he participated in the degeneration of this film, and allowed or motivated it to be so. 8 - Peni Parker only appears for about eight seconds in this film. Good things about the film: 1 - The few seconds that Peni appears; although it doesn't have the same quality as the first film. 2 - May Parker - cute. 3 - It's one of those films where I can kiss my girlfriend, because the film doesn't deserve attention.","JUN 28, 2023",1,Animation

The Super Mario Bros. Movie,"IN A NUTSHELL: Can you believe I’ve never played any of the Mario Brothers games? I have four sons, so it definitely was played in my home for years. I tried playing it once, but that was when my kids were out for blood and absolutely did not let me win just to humor me. They would kill me within minutes. I did notice that whether my sons had guy friends or girl friends over to hang out, everyone wanted to play it. I spent a lot of money on Nintendo over the years! While critics are not loving this thinly-plotted movie adaptation, fans are giving it a big thumbs up and being swept away by the nostalgia. Because the game has been so beloved for four decades, the pressure was definitely on to get it right. The film was directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic. The script was written by Matthew Fogel. THINGS I LIKED: The fantastic voice talent includes Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Jack Black, Seth Rogen, Keegan-Michael Key, Charlie Day, Fred Armisen, Sebastian Maniscalco, and Kevin Michael Richardson. They all did an excellent job. Many of them showed up at the premiere wearing outfits that paid tribute to their characters. Cute! Jack Black had some great moments in the movie. I always love it when he sings! It’s never great, but always hilarious. Seth Rogen’s laugh is so recognizable, so it was funny to hear Donkey Kong laugh like that. Fans will get a kick out of all the hidden Easter eggs, which are many! In fact, the game appears to be designed as pure fan service. If you see this in the movie theater, you’ll be surrounded by enthusiastic fans who will cheer and clap, making it all the more fun. It’s extremely colorful with enough details in every frame to keep you entertained and engaged. I love details. I love that simple scenes include the up-and-down movement of the game, as characters jump and climb to get over obstacles. Clever. Nice animation brings the video game back to life but in a more detailed way. The pasta looked delicious! Lots of amusing humor, both spoken and visual. The music and sound effects are super fun. The Mushroom Kingdom looks fantastic and so magical! That’s when the movie really came alive for me. It’s one of the best video-game adaptations I’ve seen on the Big Screen. Adorable ending. THINGS I DIDN’T LIKE: There is no real character growth. Because I’ve never played the game, I was hoping to learn more about the characters and backstories. Adults who have never played the game won’t be as interested, deciding it’s just a whole lot of color and noise like a cartoon that plays on the TV while the kids engage with other toys and activities in the same room. The plot is very simple and thin. I agree with the critics. The story doesn’t move the scenes forward. Instead, the scenes exist for fan service with a weak plot that stitches them together. Some of the songs don’t quite fit the video game but will resonate with older fans of the Nintendo era. I wanted to see all of the details in the backgrounds, but they were usually blurred out.

The Super Mario Bros. Movie,": Mario has always been a name synonymous with adventure, discovery and endless fun. However, the Mario movie transcends all expectations, providing viewers with an absolutely remarkable animated odyssey. There's no denying that the creators pushed the boundaries of animation with this masterpiece, combining speed and precision to depict each scene with stunning vitality and impeccable clarity. Every frame, every movement, every visual detail is meticulously orchestrated, bringing the Mario universe to life in a way that is both familiar and revolutionary. The animation flows with a speed that might seem dizzying, but is, in reality, the result of exquisite craftsmanship, ensuring that every moment is captivating and memorable. The film's humor is, in a way, a breath of fresh air. Opting for a simplistic approach, the film nevertheless manages to trigger persistent and heartfelt waves of laughter, proving that simplicity can be extraordinarily effective. In many ways, the humor of the Mario film stands out, surpassing even some of the contemporary French comedies in its authenticity and charm. **** Conclusion, the Mario film is not only an achievement, it is a brilliant celebration animation and humor. It’s a cinematic triumph that dazzles, entertains and captivates from start to finish. A cinematic experience that will remain engraved in memories, reflecting the inexhaustible magic of the Mario universe and the boundless passion of the creators who brought this extraordinary epic to life.","OCT 13, 2023",10,Animation
The Super Mario Bros. Movie,"It was well done and fun to watch, but it’s not quite what I was expecting. I think I was visualizing it to be more visually reminiscent of the Super Mario 1, 2 & 3 Nintendo NES video games and it wasn’t. The mainstream rock/pop music seemed a bit out of place and really had nothing to do with the Super Mario franchise whatsoever. If anything, those songs should have been replaced with a few more familiar sound effects from the video games.","OCT 25, 2023",7,Animation

Donkey Kong was just Seth Rogan, Mario was just Chris Pratt with a slight accent/voice. They just sounded like the celebrities rather than the characters I know and that removed me from the experience. I also felt like they could've done so much more with the source material, so many missed opportunities for references and ways to blend story and game together. I feel like a load of executives influenced the film and it wouldn't surprise me if those executives were more on the Illumination side of things, rather than the Nintendo side. It wasn't entirely unpleasant, it got some laughs and I enjoyed a fair amount of the film. But it just could have been so much better.

The Super Mario Bros. Movie,"I'm truly conflicted. (watched on Amazon Prime) Cinematography: Visuals are literal eye candy, although there is a lack of diversity that causes it to become paradoxically bland 1/4th into the film. The palette is shockingly narrow. Some scenes have a lot of detail, but they don't remain on screen for too long. The ""magic world"" doesn't have as much texture detail as the ""real world"". Some visuals are 100/100 - but the whole package due to lack of diversity gets a 60/100 - by the end of the movie the visuals are tired - don't want to watch another movie like this ever again tragically. Story: There is no real story, characters are one dimensional - especially peach - the plot is so mind numbingly basic and crammed together. I think what bothers me the most is that it isn't how I imagined these characters at all or the story of the games. The movie doesn't take itself seriously. Casting: I think the most disappointing thing was that Jack Black and Seth Rogan broke immersion by inserting tenacious D and pineapple express moments - not once but continuously. Donkey Kong has an obnoxious Seth Rogan stoner laugh, Bowser is Jack Black with an attitude. Again the movie doesn't take itself seriously. Overall: Very short movie, crammed together, vapid, visually stunning at first but by the end nauseating and bland; leaves an odd dissatisfaction/void at the end that is even commented on by the movie itself. Only some cool visuals every few minutes and homages to the games hold this together, but otherwise is a complete rainbow mess that doesn't take itself seriously. I was holding out hope until the ending; would've given it an 8 out of 10 - but the way it ended - 4 out of 10. ""Dissatisfying"".","MAY 16, 2023",4,Animation

The Super Mario Bros. Movie,"Yikes this movie is overrated by the fans. Cheesy pop tunes pull you out of the movie, which are especially strange considering the insane catalogue of music they have and the inhouse music talent of Nintendo that must have been at their disposal. Then there's the bone dry plot, it's blander than plain cottage cheese and dry chicken breast, basically the only exciting part is Jack Black's Bowser. THEN there's the mediocre voice acting, they seriously went with Chris Pratt solely because he is a big name, they should have gotten a more mario-esque voice. Probably could have just let Jack Black do the voice and it would have sounded better honestly. You know if this is one of your first rodeo's with animated movies I can see why it could be a 10 or a 9. However after 30 years of enjoying animated movies, I've just seen this movie a dozen times. Which doesn't make it inherently bad, it's just lazy IMO. This movie is a fun colorful way to spend an hour and a half, but that's about it. If this movie did not have the Mario name behind it people would be ignoring it completely.

The Super Mario Bros.

The thing is that the script, the plot is built for ages 8-13. Yes, adults can relish in the high-tech animation and enjoy nostalgic pop songs like ""Take on Me"" and ELO's ""Mr Blue Sky"" which leads into final credits, but most of the situations and certainly the fight physics are ludicrous, unless you're ages 8-13. The voice cast is comprised of A-list actors but they either can't do voice overs or they just didn't try, and you know why? There was not one credit for voice director or coach! A gazillion credits listed for animators, artists, musicians, and even a credit for a sole intern(!) but not a voice director. Young kids and their parents will certainly give high scores and they're the ones that led this film to its $1.3B w/w box office haul, but for everyone else, it's just a meh thing.","JUN 7, 2023",5,Animation

The Super Mario Bros. Movie,"Nostalgia cannot save this movie. It was decent at some points but, for the most part I was rolling my eyes. It was cool being able to identify the games they referenced and so on but, their explanation for not having Italian voice actors was stupid. Mario went from navigating the hustle and bustle of New York hopping through loops like a pro, to then getting completely annihilated by a course. He was then upstaged by the usual ""damsel in distress,"" which literally made me furious. At what point in the games is Peach the actual star? It's always Mario, he is saving Peach, she's always locked away in Bowsers' castle. In a Hollyworld that wants to push woke agendas, here we go again! As I was walking out of the theater a woman asks her husband, who exactly are the characters and their purpose and the man says, ""It's Mario, Donkey Kong and Luigi, what more do you need to know?"" That summarized the viewing audience for me, children and adults who literally know the IP's but, nothing of their adventures. The movie will sell well because kids will digest anything with pretty colors and stupid dialogue and parents will just go along with it. As a die hard Mario fan I left completely disappointed. The entire time, I just wanted to go home and play the video games instead. Also, I hate Illuminations animation style, the way they render eyes freaks me out and Peach didn't even put her hair in a ponytail when she consumed the fire flower. Don't get me started on how they literally bent Bowser over and just...well you know. For those saying the ""fans"" are over-hyping this, I once again am a die-hard fan, with extensive knowledge of the lore and I do not support this film at all. The ""fans"" are just a bunch of people who played Mario Kart 7 & 8 or, Mario Party 8, 9, 10 (Not the good ones.) In the words of the King, I say to this movie; BOOO!!!","APR 18, 2023",3,Animation
The Super Mario Bros. Movie,"An aggressively mediocre movie. Mario is arguably one of the best video games franchises ever as its formulas just work well, however it has a big flaw: not being able to flesh out things surrounding the narrative such as plot and characters. Will the movie be able to change that since these are crucial aspects for a movie? The answer is no, as 'The Super Mario Bros Movie' is completely afraid to take any risk. The plot is as predictable and basic as it can get with many sub-plots that either get pushed aside or are straight-up ignored. The ridiculously fast pacing also doesn't allow you to enjoy each scene to the fullest and makes the plot even more messy than it already is. The voice acting went full mainstream (and with mainstream I mean boring). The iconic Charles Martinet, despite being available, does not reprise his role as Mario and Luigi but is voicing a side character instead. Chris Pratt as Mario sounds as grating as you'd expect and Bowser aside, all characters sound almost as off as he does. Why is this movie so beloved then? Why is it so high when it fails on almost everything? Simple, because it's Mario so you HAVE to like it, but if it wasn't for Mario this movie would never be as big as it is. Its fans will tell you to not listen to critics because they are ""complaining"" and ""nitpicking"", but in reality critics were the only audience that wasn't biased with this movie.","SEP 10, 2023",3,Animation

It follows the titular plumbers (voiced by Chris Pratt & Charlie Day) on an adventure that basically looks like a video game. There's a bit of water works to start, but that gives way to them bouncing thru a variety of objects and obstacles in the Mushroom Kingdom. The plot involves Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) coming up against the evil king Bowser (Jack Black) with the subsequent battles, but it's basically more of the same.

There’s nothing especially standout, imaginative, groundbreaking, and that means we all have to bear some of the collective burden of whatever consequences arise from catapulting this shambling hulk of nostalgia into the stratosphere. And who benefits? Who really succeeds when Seth Rogan gets paid for voicing a cartoon character? (I am very attracted to the thesis of Egan’s article, that Wreck It Ralph paved a path for video game movies to follow, and that this particular movie is stuck in reruns in its first installment.) “Connecting the dots” was the way that one Friend described the lack of plot to this movie, the slavish attention to including as many video game references as possible without really thinking too hard about how those scenes might flow one to the next. This movie was not extraordinarily interested in carving a new path for itself. It deployed a small, almost entirely white cast of dad comedians to lure children into theaters. The interview the dude bros of the cast did where they played Mario Kart while talking about their relationship with the Mario games solidified for me the fact that Anya Taylor-Joy probably didn’t spend a lot of time hanging out with her coworkers for this one, and also John Leguizamo is probably right that its one step forward two steps back for this franchise in terms of representation. Two movies come to mind that offer some alternate choices that could’ve been made. The first is Detective Pikachu, the first live action movie in the Pokemon world, an almost perfect and absolutely bonkers concept in all of the rules we were lovingly brainwashed into believing about the way that Pokemon talk and the types of people who can become Pokemon masters look like are erased in a glorious kaleidoscope of murder and world building. DP departed from a lot of the nostalgia that it could’ve hewn close to without any objection and instead tried to tell a new story for an audience that was very, very familiar with the decades of lore associated with the game. The second movie is, wait for it, Shang-Chi, and I know what you’re thinking and yes, you’re absolutely right, I’m going to talk about how the siblings should’ve shared the rings and taken down the dragon together again, because every movie that has an item of extreme power and two sibling protagonists is going to serve as a vehicle for my rewrite to that Marvel movie script. But the total number of rings was even, which would make for an asymmetrical configuration if placed on the arms, you shout! To which Friend responds, they could just put on their neck like a necklace. Super Mario Bros is able to give us that moment of sharing an indivisible power source! Despite the fact that you cannot actually in any example I can think of share that thing! And that seems fine! Look, I’m mostly blah on the whole movie and the idea that it is about to make one billion dollars in the next few weeks globally really does seem like a sign that all of us, collectively, have some part in whatever evil we’ve unleashed on the world. That being said, there is nothing inherently wrong with wanting to watch Marvel super heroes voice characters from your favorite childhood video games while waiting approximately a month to watch those same Marvel super heroes in other Marvel super hero movies. I just think you should be prepared to offset this movie with some other good you’re going to do in the world after you’re done watching it. Like, you should have to plant a tree or stop eating meat for a year or something like that. By far the most rewarding part of this entire movie is actually a bit character, Lumalee, a blue star from Mario Galaxy, whose depressive and borderline suicidal quips makes him the most nihilistic and entrancing of characters. “I’ve never wanted a tattoo, but I think if I were going to get one, it would be of that little guy,” Friend said to me as we walked out of the theater. Challenge accepted.","MAY 22, 2023",3,Animation
The Super Mario Bros. Movie,"The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a 90-minute Nintendo commercial masquerading as a feature film -- it may be more faithful to its source material than the original 1993 film, but it really isn't any better. In fact, say what you will about that movie, but as terrible as it was, it at least had some ambition -- this is just nothing. Strip away all of the candy colored visuals, and what you're left with here isn't a story, but a series of references. If ever there was a movie's success that would embolden executives to ditch writers in favor of A.I. script writing, this would be it; you do not need a human to plug in a bunch of references and call it a day.

The Super Mario Bros. Movie,"Call me petty all you want, but I despise this movie for what they did to Bowser's character. According to Minion Quest: The Search for Bowser, it is established that Bowser considers ""Destroy Mario"" to be too hardcore to order his minions to do. We notice this after Bowletta (disguised as Bowser) tells Captain Goomba to do what he was born to do and ""Destroy Mario"" which confuses him as it sounds like a bit much. Bowletta tells him to begone and he goes. The Captains are talking about it and say that they already knew. Captain Goomba points out that the way he was talking was definitely strange, not like Bowser at all, because he said to ""Destroy Mario"" which is too hardcore. According to Paper Mario: The Origami King, when King Olly says he's gonna use the 1000 crane technique to grant himself the wish of turning all Toads into mere blank pieces of paper (King Olly was basically gonna commit Toad genocide) and Bowser replies to King Olly with ""What? That's crazy talk! The Toads can't come back from that, you know? I wouldn't even do that! And I've done some mean stuff, believe me, ask Kamek!"" basically setting it more in stone after what was confirmed in Minion Quest, that Bowser, does not, kill! And what does the movie do? Decides to pee on AlphaDream's grave after they went bankrupt in 2019 of course! (AlphaDream, the creators of Mario & Luigi) although all the games portray the characters the same, AlphaDream set out to reveal the message that the world of Mario really isn't all black and white. There is lots of good to the minions, and Bowser Junior's Journey even said ""Good and evil are outdated, simplistic terms, everything is relative!"" (Though the Japanese version had Bowser Junior answer if they were evil with ""Bowser's army is Bowser's army, the army of me and my dad!"" which gives off the same message of ""we're not evil, we're just us"" but the English version made it more clear) so AlphaDream set out to prove Bowser and his minions are not evil with the side modes in the Mario and Luigi remakes, then went bankrupt in 2019. Fast forward to the Movie, and the MOVIE set out to UNDO WHAT ALPHADREAM REVEALED! AlphaDream revealed that Bowser treats his minions well (even if some such as Larry Koopa take him literally and do what he says out of fear of being scolded) and although Bowser sometimes lets his anger get the better of him, it's typically when someone else provokes him like Peach deliberately outcasting him during the Blorb pandemic in Bowser's Inside Story, Bowser in the intro of Bowser Junior's Journey almost blew fire on Kamek as a result of Peach outcasting him, or when Iggy made fun of Bowser and talked bad about Bowser Junior by responding to Bowser saying Junior is a good kid by saying ""Bahaha! You're joking, right? And people say I'm the crazy one!"" or when Starlow boldly told Bowser he has absolutely NO right to visit the blorb meeting without even stopping to ask why and realizing his Goombas were going through the same problem. Despite this, we hear it from Kamek in Bowser Junior's Journey, this is why the minions choose to listen to and take orders from Bowser, as oppose to the Koopalings leaving Junior. (Larry is the only one who would really rather not do as Bowser orders, as he'd rather rest or hang with friends than defeat Mario, but does what Bowser says specifically to avoid being scolded, and the fact of the matter is that it's because Larry is a gullible kid who takes Bowser literally, and Bowser talks tough and acts tough so he can be the ""biggest baddest brute around"" in the games, but despite this, it seems Larry still sees how Bowser treats him well regardless of not wanting to do as ordered, but taking Bowser literally) Bowser is a good king to his minions to the point Minion Spirit is a thing. Although Bowser isn't always around for Junior, Bowser is an overall good father to Bowser Junior and it's shown through how much Junior wants to be just like him! But in the Movie, Bowser was HORRIBLY misportrayed, even within the first few seconds of his screentime, first thing he says ""Open the gates, or die"" adding ""or die"" was completely unnecessary and out of character for him! Then there was him going on to threaten to kill Luigi or try to kill Mario, or have his minions kill Mario which MINION QUEST ESTABLISHED IS OoC, and then the movie flanderized Bowser's love for Peach (making it way too excessive) as well as flanderized how much of a manchild Bowser is, and mixed it with the writers over vilifying him by having him threaten to kill if he doesn't get his way, and then when he GETS HIS WAY, HE ATTEMPTS TO KILL ANYWAY! And the worst part? He was attempting to kill a whole bunch of people in cages! Because he was ""sacrificing them for Peach"" when that is bad thing to put in his character, because ORIGAMI KING ESTABLISHED THIS IS OoC! Fueling the toxic Mario fandom is unforgivable and so is misportraying characters I know so well and care so much about!","APR 5, 2023",0,Animation

Ralph Breaks the Internet,"A good sequel that sometimes rival the original movie. The premise is of the franchise is that when the doors close in an Arcade the videogame characters call it a day and leave for their personal life (Like actors in a movie shooting). It is set a few years after the first movie. All the characters have accustomed to their life's when a huge change happens. The Arcade is connected to the internet. Meanwhile Ralph recognizes that Vanellope is bored by her game and tries to create something special for her. It goes horrible wrong and the two have to go on an adventures journey to save the day. Sorry I am a bit vague to avoid spoilers. It has the strengths of the original with immersive characters, a great story, tons of easter eggs and the humor works well. In total I say it is a bit weaker and less refreshing. Here they roast the internet, tech companies, cliches and more while developing the characters. The characters are again so enjoyable. Be it the older ones with Ralph, Vanellope, Felix or Calhoun or the new ones with Shanks or the princesses. I praise the whole cast of voice actors. Of cause there are tons of easter eggs, cameos, jokes and tropes. The humor works great and entertained us really well. Presentation wise the movie is awesome. I like the style, art and soundtrack. My only complain is that the start of the movie is a bit weaker but later on the movie won me over. Overall this is one of the rare great sequels. Not perfect or better than the first movie but really good and sometimes rivals the prequel. I give a 9/10 as a lower rating seems unfair.","SEP 3, 2022",9,Animation

This is IMPOSSIBLE and I’m really disappointed Disney would MISLEAD viewers making them think you can travel to another world through ethernet cables. Second, its obvious CGI was used to make the Disney princesses look un-aged (Ariel would be almost 50 now). Third, the way the movie portrays the dark web is NOTHING like what I’ve enjoyed every night there. Fourth, cat/babies aside, the internet was made for porn and there was NO PORN AT ALL. I REPEAT NO PORN. Sixth, there are a number of scenes where Ralph jumps 5+ stories high, the average human can only jump 1-2 feet! In conclusion, 99% of the scenes simply cannot happen in real life. If you’re looking for something realistic, I’d recommend Finding Nemo or Venom (both based of true stories too, and filmed in North Dakota). I absolutely hated it. But other than that, I loved it!

We could see the internet all the time, the websites, the characters, we could see how it all ""actually works"" and much more. So the first one showed us games for the 40 minutes, and in the second one we were able to see the internet all the time.

Ralph Breaks the Internet,"So this sequel is a bit confusing in the message it tries to send about friendship, which I honestly find to be a bad message to send kids. The first movie was an endearing journey into finding your place in the world and making friends. The sequel seems to be about blaming a friend for wanting to spend time with you and getting upset when they go to extremes to make that reality happen. Aside from the message about friendship it seems to convey (that its okay to snub and abandon a friend without a word as long as you can blame them later for being to needy), the actual movie itself is very entertaining. The meme references, inside jokes about the internet, and over all attention to detail about everything ""cyber"" was great. One of my favorite things was when they entered the online video game and the characters continued their run animations for several seconds after they stopped moving and how they turned left and right in choppy ""frame-drop"" fashions. The fact that Disney allowed them to poke fun at the Princesses and in general Disney's culture of the cult of personality as well was hilarious too. Some other nice touches were a small cameo of Stan Lee (gone but not forgotten) and the e-business tie ins that were not obnoxious like the Emoji Movie (the Google, Amazon, YouTube, and Twitter tie ins were all tastefully done).","DEC 7, 2018",8,Animation

Ralph Breaks the Internet,"Cyber-""Inside Out"" meets ""Once Upon A Deadpool"" PG-13 meta-humor ""Ralph Breaks the Internet,"" the latest animated wonder, is a flat-out improvement over the original, adhering itself to new technologies without losing sight of its two central figures, unfolding another riveting, clever family-friendly journey that commits itself to compete head-to-head against the most acclaimed movies of its subsidiary; it doesn't win the day, but offered something Pixar has overlooked all this time. Don't get confused, this second part does transcend all-time great arcade game's limits to venture into this binary world, developing a refreshing representation of the mechanisms and processes taking place in our everyday devices. This setting's side goal is to raise a human lesson on friendship and sacrifice, to be happy not harming the happiness of those you love, and in that sense, we stumbled upon a fairly mature and grounded resolution, which enriches the scope. It also disposes of knotty storylines by not adding up new protagonists, Ralph and Vanellope remain the leading characters, although it does incorporate supporting roles that hilarious look and behave like their voice actors such as Gal Gadot or Alan Tudyk. Storytelling-wise, Disney will always succeed on his moral and ethical task, but for that, it'll always need the corresponding tear-jerking scene, this time pretty close to that devastating farewell for the pink cotton candy nougat-filled elephant-cat-dolphin hybrid from ""Inside Out,"" they are hands down geniuses achieving it. But the greatest improvement doesn't come from right there. Despite the thousands of screen-time-eager companies, the film wisely does not overstuff its compositions, of course, there's enough product placement to know this is more than a family-friendly film, but after its first act, it mostly centers on storytelling. The Internet takes the form of a sunnier ""Blade Runner"" metropolis, where millions of avatars restlessly go and come. The many high-rises and high-tech buildings that show the companies' logos off deserve more than one viewing in order to catch the myriad easter-eggs all around the footage. YouTube, Twitter, Snapchat, Internet Movie Database, AlloCiné, and Instagram are some of the sites spotted in broad daylight, but the plot settles in BuzzTube — a hybrid of both companies — an online game called Slaughter Race, eBay and Google for the cinematic finale. Filmmaking-wise, comparisons are obnoxious and in some instances needless, and even so, it's quite obvious to draw parallels between this buddy-comedy and the creative structure of the Pete Docter y Ronnie Del Carmen-directed magnum opus ""Inside Out."" Switching Riley's five emotions and behaviors for pop-ups, web sites, links and search engines, the depictions here are magnificent, especially the extremely sinister, somewhat disturbing dark web and its creepy, ugly-looking apothecary overlord. Some cybernetic, internet-related processes also got fantastic representations, trying to make easy to understand the universe of algorithms an e-mail or a Google search involve; thus, posting a video, getting a ""like,"" writing a comment and closing specious ads become an imaginative ride. The most unexpectedly brilliant sequence of the movie happens to be killingly funny and oddly self-parodic; watching how they interact with each other and even amend one of the oldest, most rooted Disney princess rules in order to give a cleverly uplifting feminist message is sheer joy; thus this wildly anti-Disney moment turns out to be one of the key sequences in the modern history of animation. But without Disney's routine visual perfectionism, none of this would have been possible. ""Zootopia"" director of cinematography Nathan Warner hits the mark with the thousands of cards on the table to craft such an ambitious animated world, choosing, along with the huge design and art departments, vivid colors, transparencies and animations that enclose the general meaning of each company. Each branding depiction is vigorous and catching, however, these don't reach the complexity and depth of ""Inside Out,"" thus weakening its creative scope. ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" by Phil Johnston and Rich Moore is an exhilarating, fast-paced, high-concept voyage into the most dangerous addiction humankind is facing right now and at the same time is a tender, light-hearted fable about friendship and sacrifice that wholly enhances its means as for the original. It's sweet, harmless and funny like a cute cats video compilation, however, just wait to know a fantastic dark web and everything gets one more layer of meaning. Cinema has gradually adapted to the advances of humanity, for this reason, and although ""Incredibles 2"" proved it cryptically with its cunning modern-day villain, Disney's latest 2018 release is as necessary as inevitable before an audience living through screens, a generation that has left behind real interaction.","FEB 20, 2019",7,Animation

Ralph Breaks the Internet,"It’s sad this isn’t making much at the Box Office,because it’s actually well thought out than the other movie that came out that has worse animation than this. Yeah,beat that Universal. Onto the review. Half the audience was enjoying it,while the other half was letting the kids walk through the auditorium while the movie was playing (super common for Italian theaters these days). It was interesting to see while I watching the movie with a straight face,since the problem with how everyone was disappointed by it can be sort of understood. Ralph Breaks The Internet feels like Disney’s attempt at making a story with Pixar levels of screenplay that,while it mostly succeeds,feels like too much stuff that makes the runtime boring,since they knew they were making better animated movies this period of the year than Pixar’s Infinite Sequel Bucket for the 2010’s. Don’t get me wrong,there’s a lot to like here,though. The internet is not only an amazing place,but it also manages to cook up the story a little bit,aside from being “Disney Product Placement - The Movie”,rife with places like eBay,Oh My Disney... Right down to Pinterest. Yes,even Pinterest is in this,hell yeah. That doesn’t mean they always go to existing places. There are also places like Slaughter Race (a Fast And Furious-esque racing game with Fallout levels of quality that has my favourite Disney musical scene) and BuzzTube,which again,cook up the story instead of being visual gimmicks like that last movie I saw with visual prettiness. Even the Dark Web,which is supposed to be this dark and grimy place,has great animation and will later be a vital scene (with a worm mutant thing with the face that is almost a representation of Alfred Molina,who’s playing the character). The Character Development is also great. Ralph feels like he won’t stop at nothing to cheer Vanellope up (maybe a little too much…),while she has the traditional Disney Princess treatment but with Sugar Rush,even if the filmmakers try to also make up for it by adding something else. Need I say this movie doesn’t really have a villain,since Ralph always ruins something,and it feels like a clone of Finding Dory. All great stuff,right? Well,it’s too bad this feels like too much stuff crammed into one movie. As I said,the screenplay is great,and it feels like a jab at Pixar’s traditional story beats,but the problem with it is that they try to make it believable enough with every character explaining their problems,or whenever it tries to take an emotional pause (also YES,a movie that isn’t Pixar that made me cry at the theater. Bonus Point for that). That’s where the runtime comes to play. The movie clocks in at 1h56’ and either it’s because they want to fill the story with whatever the screenwriters have in mind or they want to make it feel like a drama or an epic-scale movie that is really slow but still makes you captivated by it. The 3rd Act mainly feels like the “filling the story” section,because they have to explain what’s going on with a King Kong reference,where it leads to the message being explained just like how The LEGO Movie executed it (where the main character is almost killed by the enemy only to stop at the last minute to explain the movie’s big message). And my god,the score by Henry Jackman was a big punch in the face. While Ralph Breaks The Internet is a fantastic movie,it also feels like a warning for every Disney fan in a way. Watch out for the deep Pixar-esque story they will try to cram into the gorgeous animation. If anything,it’ll make an Animation fan really entertained,but just try to make it in a convincing and understandable way,okay? Coolio.","JAN 13, 2019",8,Animation

Literally the only moment worth watching here is the bit with the princesses.

Ralph Breaks the Internet,"This is mostly for the kids, pretty dumbed down, they even define Wifi and ""the internet"", but I continued watching because I wanted to see how they represented the internet. Would Facebook dominate? Would all the big names - Apple, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Netflix - be represented, parodied? As it turns out, the internet was depicted as a space-age cityscape. It looks like Ebay bought the biggest sponsorship since they figured prominently in the story, though later, Disney got its play, mainly in the Disney Princess realm, so let me just say it now, this film seems really aimed at the daddy-daughter set. Google was represented as a high-rise office bldg where Ralph thought you got goggles. And I'm sure, much to Google's chagrin, ""The Search Bar"" was powered by fictional KnowsMore, and they used BuzzzTube vs YouTube (though the latter was referenced), so it looks like you only see a real-world representation if they paid the movie's production company for the ad-space, and the big names mentioned before were barely seen in the background if at all. Back to the story or rather the theme. As noted before, the key demographic for this is daddy-daughter and the prominent theme was the vicissitudes of kiddie friendship. A letdown for me.","FEB 28, 2019",6,Animation
Ralph Breaks the Internet,"An ok movie, but no more than that. The first one was full of video game references, however this one was full of internet references - basically advertising large companies such as facebook, amazon, ebay, etc. I didn't like the way they developed the female character who became really selfish towards the end whereas poor Ralph was reduced to a sidekick.

The animation and voice acting are still excellent, but the story is pretty unfocused and kind of jumps around from location to location. There isn’t much **** or as good of a story, which is a shame. I love the first movie. There were also a lot of serious plot holes and inconsistencies that I won’t get into here since those would be spoilers, but they really bothered me. Overall, this is a good movie to take your kids to.

Ralph Breaks the Internet,"From first impression, the internet concept worried me until watching the film. After watching the film, I can definitely say that it was not even close to as good as the first film. Ralph Breaks the internet is an average sequel to a fantastic Disney film. Fortunately, this film has fantastic animation as the internet looks great with very creative design and all the characters are full of life. I love how this film played around with most of its concepts. Although forced upon the audience, the message of friendship has a strong point. Unfortunately, this movie has several problems in the writing and characterization that ruin the film from being great. First, the story is a mess that becomes very predictable and completely breaks everything established in the first film by the third act. The film has an awful ending as Vanellope ditches Sugar Rush to be in Slaughter Race. This makes no sense and the character does not fit the tone of the game. Most of the humor is also weak with the exception of the princess scenes. A whole part of the plot has to do with Ralph making money off of stupid videos on a YouTube parody site made for the movie. In the first film, the use of video game characters lead to several great cameos, but nobody knows if these viral videos are going to be relevant in the next few years. While I did say the point of the message was strong, it feels like this film forces its message to its audience. I get that the film is about friendship, but the amount of times Ralph and Vanellope use the term ""best friend"" throughout the film is annoying. Also, Felix and Calhoun from the first film are completely forgotten here. Ralph Breaks the Internet is a disappointing sequel to one of my favorite Disney films. While the animation is excellent, the film has poor writing, bad characterization and a message forced upon the audience. This is definitely not one of the best films from Disney and it's a painfully average sequel.","JAN 1, 2019",5,Animation
Ralph Breaks the Internet,"Overall I quite enjoyed this movie, but I found Ralph's obsessiveness to be too extreme and consequentially off putting. His compulsive desire to control the kid is outright abusive and the 180 he does at the end is so abrupt that it portrays the extent of his unhealthy infatuation, (and manipulativeness), as an easily corrected misstep. In reality it's the kind of toxic behavior that'd warrant a cessation of their relationship in order for Ralph to work out his issues. I get that it's a kids movie, but the way they present Ralph's behavior imbues the movie with an insidious message that abusive behavior like Ralph's isn't as big of a deal as it really is in an actual relationship. They could've made conflict out of a less intense issue. Unfortunately, the climax, (based around Ralph's obsessiveness), really soured an otherwise impressive movie for me.","MAR 6, 2019",6,Animation
Ralph Breaks the Internet,"The pros: It is beautifully animated and the improvements in fluidity and range for our main characters is a sight to behold. The cons: Most of the film feels pointless and meandering. The references to the internet and Disney IP are cringe-worthy, the jokes didn't land, and worst of all, the message that the film tries to promote in the third act goes against the established rules of the first film and feels out-of-character for Ralph and Vanellope. It pains me to write this because the first film holds such a big place in my heart, but this sequel is unfortunately, all dust.","NOV 26, 2018",5,Animation
Ralph Breaks the Internet,"The concept is quite simply brilliant, but after about an hour it seems to have played itself out.

Ralph Breaks the Internet,"Ralph Breaks The Internet is an enjoyable sequel bringing back many of our most loved characters from the original, but also featuring a large number of brand references which left certain parts of the film feeling bloated. While some were plot related, other aspects played like advertisements, in particular, the segments featuring other Disney characters. Though Ralph Breaks The Internet has a lot more heart, at times I had flashbacks to ""The Emoji Movie"" where brand awareness took a prominent role. While it would have been difficult to create an internet world without brands like Twitter or Amazon, their presence left me wondering ""Are kids really using eBay?"" and ""Why are they using a generic video sharing site when Youtube is a thing?"" (especially when Youtube's parent company Google is directly referenced in the movie). Despite these flaws, the plot flowed well, and taught important lessons about friendship, letting go, and overcoming jealousy. While many sequels feel the need to tread the same path as the first instalment, this movie is not afraid to walk new ground. Well acted throughout with good use of humour and emotion especially during the latter half of the movie. In summary, a light-hearted and entertaining movie that is well worth a watch, but features a little too much gratuitous product placement to keep the pace it desperately needed to compete with its predecessor. 6/10","DEC 6, 2018",6,Animation

Ralph Breaks the Internet,"Ralph Breaks The Internet is an easier script than the previous one and without any polishing around the edges, the material is often chalky. Ralph Breaks The Internet Johnston and Moore's surf through the internet is free but definitely time consuming. Picking up from where we left these two characters, they had to create an almost newer dimension to fill in. And boy, did the writers came up with one. To capture an internet into a physical dimension itself scares you. It is a double edge sword though. It can be really easy as much as you are distracting the viewers. And since the glossy distraction in here is something that the audience is familiar- or in fact lives in it- it gets immensely effortless for them to hold us. Having said that, if not taken proper care of, and not worked on the details, it might come off as a one big hocum, which is what exactly happens in here. The script is definitely gripping and thoroughly entertaining. But the rich details that such animated feature usually contains, it lacks in aplenty. Aforementioned, the narration just surfs through the storyline and never digs deep, either the writers were afraid to open the vortex or just couldn't grasp it all in. Nevertheless, it still would have worked, if had better conversations, compelling arguments and genuine morale conflicts to bedazzle us. But what was once explored by Disney movies is left untouched in here. And with very little surface to walk on, it is still a smooth ride. In fact the concept has so much heart and potential in it, that the first hour of the narration is boost off by just visiting characters only. The structure of the script too is familiar to your usual Disney features. The performance cast though, ups the ante of the game. Revisiting their characters, Reilly and Silverman both are equally challenging on the screen. Their duo is a force to be reckoned with. His overprotective nature and her rebellious carefree attitude bodes well for the equation. And once again, the visual effects are jaw dropping, the artists do work a lot into it and it does pay off; this internet world projected in here is much more welcoming than the internet itself. Silverman's deep dive on mocking or updating the Disney princesses' sequence, is definitely the show stealer. One of the best bits of the storytelling is how it depicts both side of the range that this internet goes to. It shows you all the power there is by offering all the ""heart"" there is, within a snap. And it can also take all of it away with that snap itself. On that note, on that very message that is conveyed in here, the movie is a sure shot win. It also has possibly the least enthralling final acts of all. Where it was supposed to fiddle intellectually with the viewers, it instead puts up a behemoth physical stature to climb upon. It is not the most mature script ever to come across in a Disney world, but it surely is an entertaining one. Ralph Breaks The Internet is an easier script than the previous one and without any polishing around the edges, the material is often chalky.","NOV 25, 2018",6,Animation

The key to all animated Disney (Pixar) films is the dynamic relationship, and Ralph's and Vanellope's is lost in the barrage of Disney merchandising. The average episode of ""Rick and Morty, Big Mouth, or One Punch Man"" packs in five times the laughs. The first film was delightful, but ""Ralph Breaks the Internet"" always plays it safe, settling for family friendly mediocrity in an effort to build brand loyalty.

We also have newcomers like shank and yesss which was introduced out of nowhere with barely any proper character development and they're basically just there to advance the story. The movie also has disney princesses which made the movie a bit interesting but mostly they were just there to also push an agenda that they don't need men to tell them what to do.

Ralph Breaks the Internet,"Since first getting a Facebook account on August 2008, immediately before sophomore year of high school, my social media history has been an interesting one as it helped me tremendously with friendships. With ten years’ worth experience in the communal web, I can easily say Ralph Breaks the Internet can barely understand friendship, nor decide whether it prefers to sustain friendships in person or over technology. While there’s a place for it, the internet is also an easy place to start heated pointless arguments over whether Angelina Jolie or Alicia Vikander portrayed Lara Croft better. The problem is that this mega surface-level feature celebrates the fake glory of the impersonal digital saturation, giving greater development to the flat Disney princesses amplified by the trailers. The lack of real characterizations is covered up by blaring Demi Lovato’s “Let it Go“ rendition for the kids and throwing around pop culture gags for the parents. It isn’t always successful however, as some jokes, such as one 1960s Batman transition into princess pajamas, may bore parents with the inconsistent personality, while other pieces of dated media will confuse kids ten years from now. Other efforts to satisfy everyone with an otherwise fun musical number is less imaginative than any Disney classic readily available on Amazon Prime. While both Vanellope and Ralph do wind up tarnishing each other’s wobbly story arcs, everyone behind the microphones still express a new immersive side to social media, packed with one climactic animation achievement after another. While constant, the modern trends are still utilized to the best of the directors’ ability to push the plot forward, most effectively being the realistic graphics of modern online games that promise money. It sounds exactly how a civilized internet city would sound, including a “Which Disney Princess Are You” personality test interpreted as a game show, alongside some lickity-split live auctions at eBay. In between, the terrific Taraji P. Hensen, voice of the dysfunctional head running BuzzTube’s algorithms, graces the ears. It makes me anxious to see what LinkedIn would look like! These clever setups are all used to say that blocky video games ought to fear the internet, like how any common experience on Facebook starts wonderous, then defies expectations after going deeper. It’s demonstrated by Ralph and Vanellope’s first cheery impressions past the WiFi, the scariest the public web gets being a couple of Stormtrooper guards inside Oh My Disney dot com. Needed humanity furiously breathes in the always happy static web, particularly an “Ask Groot Anything” panel that even then isn’t nearly as hilarious as a post-credit scene that serves as a punchline to various humans controlling these tacky cube-headed avatars. With that level of passion in creativity, it’s forgivable that Disney fails to point out more of their own princess clichés without briefly embracing some racist stereotypes. Now, just one last tidbit of praise before getting to the meat of this movie’s issue: Sarah Silverman’s adorable liveliness as Vanellope allows the sweet moments between her and Ralph to shine, especially when she starts nervously glitching. It contrasts Bill Hader’s quickly paced newspaper boy voice of a spam bot, which is just one of many details that springs the vast world to glowing life. Okay now, back to my Facebook account, I would still be lost today without its convenience of helping me acquire better interpersonal sympathy. Hence, my understanding of people far surpasses how these screenwriters understood the logic of their script, which I would argue even matches the logic of that weird 1993 live action Super Mario Bros. adaptation. For the sake of plot convenience, Vanellope successfully drives a new car for the very first time, a level of carelessness that removes depth from the newer characters. Not to mention Disney’s familiar emotional beats are here without any genuine screenwriting risks taken. Laws seem pretty loosey-goosey around the world of Ralph and Vanellope’s arcade, with the sole security between them and the WiFi being a few police lines. Heck, the whole reason the two must go into the web in the first place is because the Sugar Rush track drove itself, causing the wheel to break, a fracture that has never happened before in the history of arcade games. There’s also a virus creator with a tumor-twin who becomes a butt for predictable tumor puns, and can simply conjure up viruses on a whim; shouldn’t dangerous virtual threats then happen more frequently? While we’re at discussion about our own world, which seems to be the subject of this movie, how is it Wreck-It Ralph doesn’t exist… yet all other Disney properties do? Somebody please explain the confusion!","DEC 27, 2018",5,Animation
Ralph Breaks the Internet,"Ralph's sequel moves almost entirely away from games and explores a visualized internet in the same way Inside Out visualized an emotional brain. I left feeling worse about the state of the internet, as the movie largely props up some somewhat sad trends: 1) Kids obsession with superficial fun (emoji's and silly shareable things, which is mostly fine) and 2) Kids idolization of internet popularity and fame, and the goal of gaining it through whatever means possible.

Ralph Breaks the Internet,"I did not know that a thing could both be a garbage fire and soggy bag of dogfood in a winter downpour, but Ralph Breaks the Internet, aside from being an exercise in lowered expectations, accomplishes that stereoscopic feat. This film should be required watching for every schoolchild, if only so that they can have that stomach-churning feeling that comes from watching something you love spoil and rot like a melon on a stoop two weeks past Halloween. In the lead up to the mistake of seeing this film, I had read some high-minded headlines about Ralph and Toxic Masculinity, but much like the film itself, the review was a bit of a catfish, in that it fails to mention that any semblance of self-awareness is lost in the pondering morass of product placement and too-old internet memes. The Disney princesses are by far the most interesting commentary on the past limitations of storytelling in the Disney franchises and it lasts for approximately two minutes, without much more to add than the trailers. Gal Godot is perfect for her role, serves as a positive female role model for a younger generation and injects into the story a subplot about the power of female relationships and finding your tribe. RBI is one of those comedies, like indie-darling, Eighth Grade, and the more mainstream Blocked, where woke platitudes are omnipresent from the very beginning of the film and the true tension at the heart of the film is the struggle to live up to those new progressive principles when challenged by our darker, less generous selves. Unfortunately, RBI is a sequel, so it’s more concerned with selling merchandise than it is with storytelling. The best that can be said about RBI is that you can buy a ticket for this movie and sneak into Fantastic Beasts in order to avoid giving money to Johnny Depp.","OCT 12, 2019",1,Animation

Ralph Breaks the Internet,"Ralph Breaks the Internet is, like another reviewer said, a mixture of Ready Player One and The Emoji Movie, without the visual appeal of the first or the slightly redeemable pop-cultural references of the second. Ralph Breaks the Internet is too heavily reliant on tongue-in-cheek nudge-nudge references at the audience to create a semblance **** story. The plot is overall lacking, with no central theme or thesis apparent. While the message that the movie wishes to send is readily obvious (a product of this movie's intended audience), it fails to deliver on that as well. Instead of showing the viewer what to think through provoking or resonant scenes, the movie chooses instead to deliver a musical number, out of place in a Wreck It Ralph movie, and to focus on Disney paraphernalia.

Ralph Breaks the Internet,"Top points for the imaginative way the Internet is depicted but everything else falls short. Just not as funny and memorable as the first. The characters are pretty dull, hardly any fix it felix and the writing isn't as sharp. For a film about game characters there's hardly any gaming or new gaming characters introduced. Also the title is misleading in the sense that Ralph only breaks the internet right at the end of the movie and you never get a sense of the real world panic that ensues. I was hoping you'd see everyone losing their minds. A real opportunity wasted in that sense. Mediocre is the right world for this. It's all topped off with a lashing of Disney sentimentality too as the plot becomes centered around relationship issues between friends and everyone has a good cry, yawn.","DEC 6, 2018",2,Animation
Ralph Breaks the Internet,"Does this movie really has almost the same score as the first one? That means that THIS is almost as good as the original? I DON'T think so. I can't say this movie was disappointing because I wasn't expecting ANYTHING good from this movie, the trailers make it look like it was going to be another Emoji Movie and just Disney references, so cringeworthy. I'll start with the bad. The Bad: -The premise and concept could have potential to be good, but Disney just messed it up. The ""internet world"" they're representing is so bland, predictable and lacks any creativity, like I think that's what everyone imagines how the internet looks and works. I can't say I could do it better because if I was in charge of creating the world of this movie, honestly, I would have the same idea, but I expect some creativity from Disney. When your ""internet"" world looks very similar to the ""smartphone"" world of the Emoji Movie, you are doing something wrong. -The plot is so dumb even if it's aimed towards children. This movie gives so stupid and ridiculous explanations on how viral videos work. Is Disney trying to teach kids that they will get 27000 dollars in less than a day for spamming the internet with dumb videos of them copying already viral videos? Because that's the exact same thing Ralph does in the movie. That's not how the internet works and even for a silly kids movie, this is so ridiculous. -I actually liked the princesses scene, but the movie literally shows what you saw in the trailers and just a couple more minutes of it. Also it doesn't fit in this movie, this could be better if it was a standalone short, not a part of a movie like this, such an unnecesary scene, but well, I guess it was ""important"" for the plot after all. -I don't understand the praise towards the ""Slaughter Race"" musical number. Yeah it's cool on its own, it has that classic Disney Renaissance vibe, but it made me cringe when I remember from what movie it is from, it's an unnecesary scene. -They turned Ralph into an unlikable character, he does so many stupid things that just made me facepalm through the entire movie. He turned out to be this movie's twist villain, I guess. However, there is one thing I actually liked, SHOCKER! The Good: -The message this movie tries to give at the end of the movie. It's so realistic and relatable, if this topic was the focus of the entire movie, I think it could have been SO much better. Disney should stop making sequels, but I obviously know that will not happen as they are doing it for obvious reasons ($$$) Just makes me sad that they made a mediocre sequel to a movie that didn't really need a sequel. Why not release this straight-to-Netflix? I guess because they didn't have anything original to release in theaters in 2018 and they needed to make money.","MAR 30, 2019",2,Animation

It feels like a soul-less massive ad, where the brands are just plastered in your face with no real intention behind them other than ""hey it's the big brand that has offered more cash"". Even character cameos are missed oportunities (specially Sonic, who's only purpose is a brief exposition monkey with plenty of missed oportunities for jokes about SPEED and INTERNET). The music is so generic i was unable to recall any tunes right after i left the cinema when i was discussing it with friends. The motivations were weak at best, and everything was massively contrived and forced, and things that are complete non-issues. The representation and jokes about internet itself are also incredibly weak and dated, not to mention cringy and confusing. It's like some grandpa decided to make the script when he heard the word ""memes"" and ""youtubers"". And let's not talk about world originality, because it lacks it entirely: it's all big buildings and silly looking avatars walking around. And last but not least, it's a movie that is a sequel to a movie about games, for a movie about games, with characters that are videogame based, the gaming theme is completely Lost. There is one game in the entire internet and it's barely fleshed out, and you only know it's an online game and not an arcade because they show you two kids on their couches, literally, they act like only one or two gamers can be in the ENTIRE SERVER at the time, a game that should be like GTA, filled with different servers and thousands or millions of players, considering its popular and addictive enough that someone is willing to pay 40k for a car (and the players that attempted it and spent hours to get it didnt even look like your typical end-game character, so it adds more to the generic-ness and lack of understanding on online gaming of it all).

Funniest stuff for me comes at the beginning (which was basically all the stuff from the trailers) and in the end, where I had some genuine LOL moments.

Minions,"I had watched Despicable Me just to understand the memes and to get within the lines of the pop culture. I never understood the deal with the Facebook memes which have pictures of Minions in them and have quotes written next to them. So I used to think Minions always speak out funny one liners for the audience to have a quick laugh at. After watching Despicable Me I realised this was nothing but cheap publicity, but then I decided to watch the whole franchise anyway, and so here we are. After having watched the original trilogy, this one feels a step back, but that doesn't mean it isn't entertaining enough. Minions is a spin-off to the Despicable Me franchise (the name of the franchise is Despicable Me or Minions, I will never know). This tells the story of how the Minions found Gru and became his, well, minions. In the beginning the Minions were only wild animals who used to serve whoever was evil. They move on from one master to another, until they have none left. And that's when three Minions set out on an adventure - Bob, Kevin and Stuart (isn't it funny that they have English names even though they were born before humans existed?). The franchise has a really good animation style. It looks cute enough to be memorable, especially seeing the Minions take part in activities in the things they see for the first time. Even the action scenes of these movies are incredible. Scarlet Overkill being shown as a total badass and then getting her comeuppance made this movie so much fun to watch. Queen Elizabeth's mockery was also very funny, especially the part where one of the Minions tries to pull the sword out of the stone. The ending with Gru was also very unexpected and gave the movie a happy (?) ending. What this movie lacks in, however, is the storytelling. This is not a good movie, but rather a good ""enough"" movie. There's nothing in this which you haven't seen before. The plot is mostly predictable, many parts are very annoying to watch, especially Scarlet being a generic female villain who always wins with martial arts. Other than Queen Elizabeth and Herb there weren't any memorable characters. Herb was memorable and still I forgot his name. Minions is one of those movies I can imagine kids going crazy over, since the movie is targeted only for them. If you're an adult you will find this movie very childish. It's not like the Despicable Me trilogy which is fun for the whole family. It has just selected all the things which made the franchise marketable and went all out in showing them here, namely, Minions.","AUG 9, 2021",7,Animation

Minions,"Despite my initial reservations about a movie based entirely around the Minions, who serve the purpose of comic relief (in their harmless, non-psycho yellow form, that is) in the two Despicable Me movies, I actually enjoyed this movie immensely. That said, I had the benefit of watching it at home rather than in the theaters, where I could easily hear the jokes over my own laughter instead of having to strain for them over both my own laughter and that of dozens of small children. There are many good things and bad things about this movie; since it's easier, I'll start with the negative. Much of the humor is reliant on sight gags and the silly antics of its little yellow protagonists, rather than the alternatively slyly subtle and absurdly outrageous comedy found in the two previous installments. Rather than focusing on the tribe as a whole (which, to be fair, it does do for all of ten minutes at the beginning of the film and intermittently throughout the rest), to cut down on character numbers and make the writing easier they choose to focus the action around three select Minions who are played directly to stereotype: leader Kevin, lazy and guitar/ukulele-playing idiot Stuart, and sweet, naively childish Bob. The story isn't much to speak of either; here's a brief summary--Minions either let every boss they have over millions of years get killed (or kill them themselves), and after a disastrous turn working for Napoleon decide to find a new boss when building their own civilization bores them. Unless you're a child, much of the humor begins to wear thin pretty quickly, and the movie plays out much like candy: sweet surface over subtle substance. That being said, I did laugh a lot at this movie. Though I listed the sight gags as a weakness, they're also a massive strength in some areas, and provided you don't put too much thought into the cartoon-style slapstick comedy can make for endless fun (to name a couple of examples: a lizard-man breathing fire onto an evil talent agent, chasing the Queen through London, the accidental slaying of the T-rex/caveman/Yeti, etc.). The voice cast is very talented and brings their A-game to the film, whether it be Sandra Bullock as a power-hungry baddie, Jon Hamm as her groovy inventor husband, Michael Keaton as the patriarch of a seemingly normal family reminiscent of a cross between the Cleavers and the Griswolds, or Pierre Coffin voicing the eponymous Minions, managing to bring distinctively different qualities to each of the main characters even with their similarities in both voice and appearance. Though the kids are unlikely to understand these until they get older, this film is jam-packed with cultural references from the start, with a title credits sequence set to The Turtles' ""Happy Together"" giving way to a Nixon poster in New York Harbor, before jumping across the pond to let England have a turn with a chase through London set to The Kinks' ""You Really Got Me"" and the Minions emerging from a sewer outlet onto Abbey Road (oh, the irony at who is walking by that very moment). As someone a bit between the two age groups, I found both hysterical. Overall, this film is by no means a game-changer for animation but is a highly entertaining movie and a satisfying origin story for the Minions, which have become cultural icons since they were first introduced to us back in 2010. Kids will have a blast with this one, and provided they don't read too much into it teenagers and parents will be able to enjoy it as well. I know I did. 7/10","AUG 14, 2016",7,Animation

Minions,"7--Good for the Kids, Not so Much for the Adults It’s an animated spin-off film starring creatures that talk gibberish. Obviously you shouldn’t be asking for much with a movie like that. But that shouldn’t be an excuse for this film to be average. I really liked the first Despicable Me movie, and the second one was OK to me. (In my opinion, it didn’t live up to it’s predecessor). With “Minions”, I was cautiously optimistic. This movie made me think of another animated spin-off that came out a while ago, “Penguins of Madagascar”. They both suffer from similar issues. Both films feature the antics of (previously-supporting) cast members who mostly provided comic relief. While the minions just mess around and spout nonsense, there still was opportunity to maybe tell a story with them. Unfortunately, the filmmakers failed to do this as best as they could have. The Nelson family were an amusing bunch of characters, but I think their roles should’ve been expanded. As they’re the first humans Kevin, Stuart, and Bob meet, they should’ve had more importance and influence on them. The minions are so impressionable, yet the Nelson’s don’t leave any lasting influence or mark? Scarlet Overkill (Sandra Bullock) and her husband Herb are both fun characters, but neither of them are ever fully developed or made unique in any way. The minions themselves are what you’d expect. The plot of the movie revolves around villains attempting to steal the Queen’s crown. Herb’s gadgets make this relatively easy, but if he had them all along, why didn’t Scarlet use them to steal the crown earlier? She’s very capable, but for some reason lets the minions do the work for her. Why? I think one of the main reasons this movie exists is to sell merchandise--particularly toys. “Minions” is ultimately a dumb, but harmless kid film. It doesn't live up to the first two Despicable Me movies. It's definitely not as good as Inside Out, which came out a few weeks ago. But if you want to watch it, I recommend renting it or seeing it on Netflix. I have reviewed 40 movies (on Metacritic and IMDB), some recent ones, including: Inside Out, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Fast and Furious 7, The Divergent Series: Insurgent, Taken 3, and more. I also review TV shows. Notes: The minions’ submissive nature and tendency to have a villainous master was actually a pretty interesting concept IMO. It had never occurred to me that the minions had actively sought out masters; in ‘Despicable Me’ they are all just shown to be employed by Gru and their origins are never really explained.","JUL 13, 2015",7,Animation
Minions,"Are you looking for a movie that will tighten your abdominal muscles from excessive laughter? Look no further, the Minions is a hilariously cute movie. You can look forward to scene after scene of amusing entertainment. These little servants will delight any audience with joy as they work on accomplishing any task they are faced with. You won't regret watching this cute, fun-filled, and family friendly animated movie. The minions are small, yellow, cylindrical creatures, who have one or two eyes. They are shaped like bananas but they look big and round shape and they also look like big water pump metal shape too. Each minions looks are different by weight, size, height and shape. Most of them have spiky hair, some of them are bald with no hair. Speaking like a Minion isn’t just a matter of making nonsensical sounds with foreign words thrown in here and there. Minions talk a lot like babies. Each words they say is different, only thing is understandable is banana how they say it. Most time they copy what the other person says with funniest accent,but some of the words are similar to english words if you compare them. Minions are really funny characters in the movie, Minions. Their little, chubby stature and yellow color adds to their cuteness; which is accommodated by their gibberish mixture of languages results in many hilarious phrases. For example, minions sing a lot of popular songs that sound amusing when delivered from their little cartoonist faces, like YMCA (originally by Village People). Their witty little faces were designed without a nose, and some minions have one eye while others have two, with different colors. They are very expressive and mischievous in a humorous way, they love attention. As the minions search for the ultimate master to serve, they deliver an amusing entertainment of shenanigans throughout the movie. There are so many funny scenes in the movie, Minions, which makes the movie more interesting and fun to watch. Since minions are funny themselves by just the way they look, it makes the audience want to see more of their cuteness and funny roles. They look so silly with the electric looking pieces of hair hanging out of their yellow, bald heads. I remember watching the scene pretty much in every movie they came out with which never goes out of my head is when the minions say “banana.” Just the way they pronounce it with little cute baby eyes is hilarious. The part when one of the minions said “banana” he was actually starving at that point in the boat at the middle of the ocean so his friend across him looked like a banana to him and he tried to eat him so that made the movie silly and funny. There are also many funny scenes in the movie, for instance, when they get lucky and achieve stuff without even trying which makes it funny. One of the minions pulled the throne knife out of the stone while people were trying to arrest him, but when he pulled it out people were amazed. This resulted in him becoming the king. So overall the minions look funny talk funny and also act funny which makes every part of the movie funny. It isn’t always easy to find a movie that everyone agrees on. Luckily, you don’t have to look any further! Minions is an entertaining motion picture for people of all ages. A simple, yet captivating feature that has reasonably developed a considerable amount of publicity. According to the box office, Minions attained a $115.2 million debut; the second biggest animated film opening in history. Whether you are looking for a cute date night, a pleasant family outing, or just want a good laugh, this animated film will not disappoint. From toddlers to seniors, this cute film has captured the attention of a broad audience. It is easy for younger children to follow the plot, but still maintains enough mature humor to keep the interest of an older crowd. An all around feel-good the whole family can enjoy together. If spending quality time as a family unit is important to you, definitely consider Minions. Parents can appreciate seeing their children joyfully laugh at the silliness of the characters, while also enjoying the movie themselves. A perfect group affair that everyone will adore. Minions, is an adorable film everyone will enjoy. These wacky characters have comically grasped the attention and hearts of the audience. Between their looks and personality, no one can resist how adorable the minions are. This movie will have everyone in the audience with their faces full of laughter. From toddlers to seniors, anyone who watches Minions will have a wonderful time.","OCT 10, 2017",8,Animation

I was disappointed with this prequel and Minions proves that the Despicable Me series has overstayed its welcome.","JAN 9, 2019",4,Animation

Minions,"Fun characters and movie, but... It was kind of off-putting. The film features Despicable Me's popular character, the Minions. The film is supposed to be a prequel, but it is mostly a British satire, and for a PG-rated comedy, there are a lot of black jokes. Some of the gags are funny, but many of them are juvenile. If you think the film is funny, you will be offended by such gags. The dancing of the guards is disgusting. The uncle's naked dancing is more offensive than funny. I was not satisfied with this kind of storyline to begin with. The story is too childish and sketchy about going to a bad guy party and serving the most powerful bad guy. Couldn't they have come up with a better theme or script? The characters are adorable. If parents and children saw this movie together, the children would be immediately attracted to the characters and would say it was interesting. But the parents don't take it very seriously. They are not interested in black jokes and a script that could be improved.","APR 2, 2023",5,Animation

Minions,"Whilst these gooey lemons weren't the focus of Despicable Me, they were without a doubt the stars. As great as Gru was, not a single kid or adult left cinemas without at some point going ""Bannana!"" So it makes sense that they should end up getting a movie all of their own, that still has the same great animation and visual gags that made the franchise enjoyable to begin with. It starts out giving a brief back-story for the history of the minions. Turns out the minions have been around since the dawn of time, always following the most evil bosses they can find. But their masters don't seem to last long as the minions end up accidentally causing the downfall of everyone of them, from Genghis Khan to Dracula. After hiding out for several years (leaving them oddly absent from having to work for the likes of **** or Stalin), 3 of the pint sized ducklings (Kevin, Stuart and Bob) go off to America in search of a new master in the 60's. Thus they go on an adventure, finding a new master called Scarlett Overkill, stealing a crown and accidentally taking over England. The plot never actually takes any form, never remaining focused for long with the small yellow blobs getting distracted by every passing thing. But with the slapstick and chaos of the minions you don't really need one. It's less of a story and more of a series of sketches for the minions to put them into different situations going from hanging out with a family of bank robbers to being stepped on by the Beatles in Abbey Road. An unexpected joy of this film ends up being the soundtrack. Not just because of the great Minion renditions (it starts off on a particular high note with the minions singing the 20th Century Fox theme), but also just a great selection of classic 60's tracks that should fill parents with nostalgia and introduce kids to some classic tracks. However the film does have one key problem, which is there's too much from the minions. Their slapstick is funny, but it's not enough to carry the film for an hour and a half on it's own and ends up feeling worn out towards the end. The Despicable Me films mixed in Gru's brand of humour where he played the victim, that stopped the minions slapstick from becoming repetitive. It's also lacking the same emotional core that a character like Gru brought to Despicable Me, with his bittersweet story of a man becoming a father being far more engaging than a crazed villain wanting to own a crown. But whilst the minions work much better as side characters, this spin off never feels like a misfire. It still has enough humour to be fun for the family, but just lacks the same level of rewatchability as previous films of the franchise.","AUG 14, 2015",6,Animation

This movie has practically 0 heart and 0 development. The Minions just spend the whole movie running around causing mischief and ruining things and they are not nearly as funny as they were in the first two Despicable Me movies.

Minions,"As I've had the opportunity to say before, in other reviews, animated cinema has been prodigal in the emergence of films that, following box office hits, give prominence to secondary characters who, somehow, won the public's sympathy. ""Minions"" does nothing more than repeat this recipe again, knowing in advance that it would be a box office and a merchandising hit. For the studio, this film was worth it only because of the guaranteed cash flow, and the film reveals this to us because of the little investment made in a quality plot. Really, the film doesn't have a specific story: we just see an outline of the Minions' life trajectory, extremely light and far-fetched, before we follow three of them on a trip to the US, in search of a new boss, a villain to who serve and, of course, to annoy. The film works as a prequel to the first movie in the ""Despicable Me"" franchise, an expendable prequel, made with money in mind, based on unthinkable characters for protagonists: suffice it to say that the Minions make me think of cheese puffs. It's not the kind of character I would bet to star in a movie. As a result of all this, the film is excessively long for the plot it brings, it is predictable and is full of problems of logic and historical rigor (it is set in the 70s). I'm willing to forgive the anachronies, but the problems of logic and the film's uneven pace are harder to put aside. Being a comedy, I found the film excessively lukewarm. There's really almost nothing to laugh about, especially considering that the Minions' nonsense, which was funny in ""Despicable Me"", loses its force here. The overture scene works reasonably well, but it keeps getting worse from there. It lacks, above all, creativity and good ideas, a dose of commitment in creating a film that simply relies on the cuteness of its characters. It was, from the start, doomed to be a disaster. On a technical level, the film also doesn't do as well as it would be desirable. The most salvific aspect turns out to be the visual style, colourful, vivid and vibrant, pleasing to the eye. However, this is something that almost becomes mandatory and demandable in a film that was composed with the most modern resources of computer graphic animation. The satisfactory work of the voice actors is also noteworthy. With his well-modulated voice and impeccable diction, Geoffrey Rush has done very well as a narrator, Pierre Coffin was very competent at voicing the Minions (although the voices never sound very different from each other) and John Hamm seems to really enjoy his work. Jennifer Saunders was OK, but Sandra Bullock didn't convince me. The film also features several other very good voice actors, such as Steve Carell, Michael Keaton or Steve Coogan, but does not give enough time or attention to their characters. Another positive technical aspect of the film is the soundtrack, which uses several outstanding rock songs wisely and without exaggeration.","AUG 11, 2021",3,Animation

I'm a huge fan of animation as always but this one is not for children. Yes, I said it, it's animated but not for children. It has got something that you shouldn't show to your kids. You have to be a teenager and adult to watch it because it's got something raunchy in it that will offend other people and your children will be traumatized! It has some big cast who starred in this such as Seth Rogen, Kristen Wiig, Edward Norton and Salma Hayek and the rest just to name a few. They both star in many comedies like The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, Superbad, Pineapple Express and This Is the End. The story is well cleverly written and the characters look like something of the B&W Mickey Mouse cartoon. The black lines at the way the food uses arms and legs and Seth Rogen's character, Frank has gloves like Mickey Mouse use to wear. And ask for Kristen Wiig's character, Brenda, and yes, she has the mouth of a v****. Edward Norton is Sammy who is a bagel and he talks like Woody Allen. This lavash who I don't know who his name is but I'll find out when I watch it again. The **** who is an antagonist who wants to kill Frank. Oh, and by the way that's his name though, the ****. That's his f**king name. I am not making this up! It gets grim at the third act but that's all I can tell you about it. I like the opening song where the food sings about the shop is opening and getting ready to be taken by humans known as the food would call them gods. I really like the Honey **** who is raging about the gods are the lies knowing that they will kill all of the food by eating.

The use of food makes the irreverent humor all too easy at times, but Sausage Party manages to find shocking ways to keep the laughs coming. Point in case.. bath salts are used to explain the metaphysical separation of the anthropomorphic food and the ""gods"" who eat them. In this example, the writers are clearly making fun of the typically kid-friendly genre (ex. the Toys in Toy Story). The movie is definitely not for the easily offended (100% not for families/kids).

Sausage Party,"An uprising to liberate it the supermarket. How many R rated animated films have you seen? This is not a hentai, but the Hollywood's rare animated-adult-comedy. Most of the big names are here, especially the young generation. The film took me by a surprise. I did not know when it was made and what its genre, but the posters made me very curious the with double meaning punchlines. It was a silly story, something like a parody of Pixar's 'Toy Story', but a very enjoyable film as it is a rare product. If you check the last two decade's records, the animation films tore apart the live-action films in the box office clash. It is shocking, but the fact that animations make good revenue. This film is a trend setter in animation genre that targets the adult audience. Like Hollywood found its counterpart from the Japanese hentai. It just cost only $20 million to make and the production quality was not very standard, but acceptable. Hope there will be more like this in the future, but I would seek a sequel for this. Seth Rogen was the main man behind this film. The rest of the cast too was good. Nothing but theirs voice lending made all the difference, especially you would know who were who, while a watch, that kind of familiar it was. The story of supermarket products from all the categories who fight for their freedom. I really enjoyed, it was short too, as well as a fast narration with some good adult jokes. There are a couple of negatives about it, like the first one was there's no innovation in it, like it is very familiar, but a different kind of comedy. And the next one was all the characters, I mean the supermarket products are American. So if you are a non-American, nearly 90 per cent you won't get what those items are. The adults should watch this, because I don't know when you will get another one like this in the future. So I definitely favour it. 7/10","NOV 23, 2016",7,Animation

It sounds like it could have been pulled straight from a Disney animated movie. If that Disney animated movie was a full on, vulgar attack on religion. So yes, Sausage Party is much more than a parody of Pixar movies. Normally that type of thing is annoying. However, in the case of Sausage Party it's easier to swallow thanks to the fact that it's completely hilarious and actually a fully fleshed out idea. The way it kind of mirrors Toy Story means that this feels like something that actually could have come from some kind of crude and raunchy version of Pixar. It's that much quality. The humor may be as rude and nasty as humor can get, but this is more than just vulgarity for the sake of vulgarity. The jokes are clever and inventive enough to keep you laughing throughout. The concept was marvelously executed in a way that ensures for the maximum amount of laughs possible. While perhaps a little too preachy, Sausage Party still manages to entertain. More than just a half-baked idea, Goldman, Rogen, and everybody involved turned this into something more than just a cheesy parody of Disney movies.

Cussing in a movie never bothered me and some are actually better with it but this one actually goes over board to the point that it's kind of annoying. It's like the writers couldn't really think of any good jokes so they thought throwing in the F bomb in every piece of dialogue would cut it. And the sex themed jokes come off as a bit weird also. I'm sure I laughed a little at some scenes but nothing really stuck in my mind after viewing besides that totally messed up in a bad way ending.

Sausage Party,"I had no idea what this movie was about when I saw the posters appear. I eventually got a brief synopsis of the film. I thought it would be raunchy, but amusing. I rented it from my local library. In the world of Sausage Party all food items are alive and can move around, humans just can't see them. THe grocery story items believe that when humans taken them home they go off into paradise. Frank is a good old fashioned hot dog that just wants to be taken home along with a pack of buns featuring his girlfriend Brenda. He wants to put his sausage all up in her bun. After a jar of honey **** is returned to the store with insight into the real world (food gets eaten) there is an accident that spills Frank, Brenda, and other assorted food out into the store aisles. They try to navigate the store and along the way find out about the great beyond. Oh yeah and **** **** **** ****ity **** There are some interesting sight gags in the film and the animation is well done. Most of the jokes are beyond juvenile and you can see them coming from a mile away. I still enjoyed the first 75% of the movie though. Eventually I wondered how they would resolve the main issue (humans are eating food but the food is alive). They don't really, the movie just sort of goes off of the rails. I guess this is expected due to the absurd nature of the movie. The food also really wants to get funky. There is a giant food orgy at the end. Food characters who are clearly designed to be same sex get it on. Group sex. Just lots of really raunchy stuff. Oh wow you have the two male(ish) Jewish and Arab foods who bickered all movie get down and have sex? Wow what an enlightened movie. The food orgy was funny for about 10 seconds but kept going and going and going. This was the hole point of the movie.

Sausage Party,"Before I begin, it is of great importance to say that just because something is animated does not mean that it is for kids. My case in point: Sausage Party, a raunchy, but hilarious R-rated animated film with great voice talent. The animation here, though still kind-of subpar, is nothing to scoff at. In fact, it purposely helps this comedy work so well. As far as I know, this is one of Hollywood's best attempts at comedy this year. Furthermore, it's view on fate and God is refreshing to witness. Unfortunately, this movie is weighed down by substance faults. While it succeeds in the entertainment department, the characters aren't that great. They start developing late in the narrative, and even then, their development is dropped to make way for a series of events that Hollywood knows how to put together just fine, but they neglect character in the process. It is also worth reminding that I am not a big fan of raunchy comedy, as like found footage, it serves as gimmick. too much of it leaves the film hollow. Like I said before, it is funny and sometimes hilarious and jaw-dropping, but this film was too raunchy to support character development. Certainly check it out if you can take the experience, but don't expect me to watch it again. I will grant it a seal of mediocrity.","OCT 3, 2016",6,Animation

Sausage Party,"After having seen the trailer for this one, I was pretty keen on seeing this piece of art for being extraordinarily different from the other animated movies out there so far. And in the end I didn't get disappointed, until the ending; I will get to that later. So it became quite hard to find an appropriate conclusion for this one, as for fans of dark humour, suggestive themes and explicit jokes the first scenes of the movie should be absolutely appealing. Most of the movie came up to exactly what the trailer had promised and although the best moments being relatively short in comparison to the movie, they were super fun to watch, when handling the, well, rather reckless humour. But what happened then can barely be put into clear formulation. And it's the very end of the movie that finally makes this movie become unenjoyable at certain point, at least for most of the viewers. I won't spoil what exactly happens, but at the time everyone should already know. So, even according to what you've seen before, the ending is unexpectably overstated and to take it further to appear as the creator's ""sandbox"", where they again gotr over all the stuff required to make this movie an adult entertainment program. Over all, Sausage Party is a disgusting piece of comedy, stuffed to the top with clichee, reconciliations to celebrities involced, evil and breaking the borders of age restriction. Yes, this can be seen as art, but the ending pretty much ruins everything seen before. Even when it makes you laugh, this movie will in the end only leave one question: ""What the actually ******* hell did I just watch?!?"". I am sure that is exactly what they wanted. They wanted to cause contreversy and a movie disturbing all viewers. So if you look for a ridiculious comedy that was taken too far you will like that movie. If you want to be entertained, you will like it too, but without the ending. If you want to watch a good movie, better stay off, you will thank me later.","MAR 18, 2018",6,Animation

Sausage Party,"Vulgar, immature, and beyond our current definition of stupidity, Sausage Party is a film that actually has an interesting concept. The tale of a hot dog discovering the truth surrounding his fate, Sausage Party turns into an excuse for Seth Rogen and company to thump their atheist chests at believers, while also making food puns and exclusively using toilet humor. Lowering the bar on the lowest common denominator in cinema, Sausage Party is actually worse than Deadpool. Why? Well, I liked Ryan Reynolds. Here, there are very few redeemable elements. A few food puns worked, but were hardly substantive. However, even if I was enjoying this film with humor that can solely be found in middle school classrooms, the food orgy at the end would have ruined that enjoyment. This idiotic and insipid slice of garbage cinema should honestly cause shame for those who wrote this film, for even thinking that this dialogue worked. Ignoring the fact that no joke lands, the film makes repeated sex, poop, genital, and racist jokes throughout. Yet, as it does offend everybody, the racist element does not bother me. The other parts, however, were just so easy. It is a real shame that this film is rated-R because then nobody under 18 could see this in theaters without a parent. If the audience were just 11-year olds, Sausage Party would be hailed all over as the best film since like ever. Maybe the best since Deadpool or Kingsman. However, just like those other edgy, low-brow humor films that indulge far too greatly in the sexual comedy fantasies of young boys, Sausage Party is never funny, nor is it ever enjoyable. With a disposable plot, a conclusion that makes no sense, and a gum Stephen Hawking being hailed as the one to bring reason to the world (""F*** YOU CHRISTIANS!""), Sausage Party really outdoes itself to be nothing but fleeting entertainment. Not much will last from this film as its disposable plot does nothing to save its horrific sense of humor. The tragedy here, however, is that the film wastes Edward Norton doing his best Woody Allen impression. If there was ever a good thing to come out of this, it would be for Edward Norton to simply play the Woody Allen character in a Woody Allen movie. He may have done this already (I know he's worked with Allen before), but it needs to be done anyways. What is an even more egregious tragedy here, however, is the film's treatment of women. With all female characters sexed up to the point that the camera literally just zooms in on their ass and ****, Sausage Party is the embodiment of the male gaze and the theories presented by Laura Mulvey. Even worse, the film posits the only purpose for women in the film is to be subservient to men with their only drive being their desire for a ****. This is straight out of Mulvey's beliefs regarding the role of women in film and this abhorrent piece of work truly goes out of its way to fulfill all elements. With a reliance on sexual visual gags and food puns, Sausage Party is never fun and deserves to be cast into the fires of hell for all of eternity. Somehow, it is not the worst film of the year though, if only for the Saving Private Ryan references, the queso joke, and Edward Norton. Oh the torture.","DEC 10, 2016",1,Animation

However, now that I am older, I've come to realize that Seth Rogan screaming like a **** idiot for an hour and 20 minutes is neither funny, nor clever. I will give credit to the film for not holding any punches when it comes to its more ""risky"" content. That being said, the edgy humor in this film is for the most part, shocking for the sake of being shocking. There was rarely any a time where a dark joke or skit felt well planned or had really any punchline. I have absolutely no problem with edgy and dark humor, but when its done poorly, it just comes across as **** up and abrasive.","DEC 28, 2020",3,Animation

It gets way too crazy, and not in a good way. The ending was weak, capping off a mildly enjoyable film with a disgusting taste in your mouth. It leaves you asking, ""What were they thinking?""

I get what they were trying to say in the movie, but I went in thinking it was going to be more than just cartoon characters swearing and doing sexual things. Instead only like 30% wasn't that stuff. As I said, it has some funny moments, but it was overall a bad movie.

Sausage Party,"This title is the definition of a full-fledged turd. The movie is about food who wish to be adopted by people to go to a great beyond. The foods consider people as Gods and when they exit the stores and into the homes, they realize that it isn't all sunshine and rainbows. Basically we eat them. Anyways, the movie is about some hot dog who wants to go to the great beyond, then finds out the truth, then doesn't want to go put still wants to get it on with a hot dog bun. I personally could care less for any character for I thought the jokes wee made by edgy eight year olds. Like a bad chinese ripoff of good dreamworks films. The only one nice thing that gives this god awful movie a 1 is the fact it has some decent animation and the antagonist is sort of weird but in a funny way when things didn't do as he had hoped for. Overall, the main premise of the movie is giving a big middle finger to religion but it isn't executed remotely clever. At least Family Guy makes fun of various religions in actual work put in for jokes. Even the song for Sausage Party is dreadful. I think the only reason this even had a high score with everyone else is due to the fact that we have a shortage of films in this mature way. I am sure that if we had other films that actually executed humor the right way and it wasn't under Seth Rogen, then I'm sure this crap of a so called film would've have gone out with a whimper instead of a bang like it did.

Sausage Party,"On paper this must have seemed like a sure fire hit. A crude and politically incorrect toon about food stuffs misguidedly dreaming of a better life outside of the super market shelves. Unfortunately, the execution leaves a lot to be desired and the bad taste jokes remain just that with the lack of laughs exacerbating the true offensive nature of the material, which possibly has something to offend almost everyone. There is a certain irony to be had from the fact that the film, aimed squarely at the adult market, is more juvenile in concept and writing than ‘Finding’ Dory’ or ‘Zootopia’, both of which are intelligently written, imaginative and truly funny. For most of its running time ‘Sausage Party’ flounders without inspiration in a desperately hysterical manner. A couple of gags raise a grudging smile and there is one very good sequence where the different sausages and veg discover their fates in a suburban kitchen. Other attempts at humour, however, involving a lesbian taco, a Stephen Hawking inspired bubble gum and a Middle Eastern pitta bread all fail miserably. Where the film does succeed though is in underlining the low level of humour to which the whole enterprise aspires.","SEP 14, 2016",2,Animation

Sausage Party,"This has been a spectacular year for family films -- particularly of the animated variety. Pixar and Disney stormed into theaters earlier this year with the breathtaking hits Finding Dory and Zootopia, respectively. The Secret Life of Pets did so well that a sequel already has been announced. And live-action family fare continues to entertain, with families heading to the theaters this weekend to see what Pete's Dragon has in store. Needless to say, families have been finding ample programming opportunities at the multiplex all season long, as Hollywood has offered all kinds of fantastic animated movies that are suitable for all ages. Sausage Party is NOT one of those movies. For real, don't bring your kids to Sausage Party. I can't say that often enough. Don't bring them. This is not a dig on the R-rated comedy. Our own Greg Wakeman LOVED it, and most adults will laugh their asses off during it. I'm 100% certain, however, that co-creators Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg -- the guys behind This is the End and Pineapple Express -- don't want you to bring your kids to this movie, despite the fact that it's animated.

If you go into a film starring these two guys expecting some kind of thrilling plot and something at all serious then you're missing the point, this is just pure, farcical lunacy which for me works on every level. The characters of Holmes and Watson are parodied so effectively, it's obvious the writers know them well and are fans of Holmes. This film is as quotable as Anchorman and I think that over time it will also achieve cult status. Any film that Rotten tomatoes gives 3% should spike your interest.

People are just pissed about the adaptation (and the movie is based on the anime, it is not an adaptation) because they wanted something more similar to the anime. And because of that they are looking for excuses to tear the movie apart. The main character here has a different personality (he is not a villain like in the anime) and some other things about the base story are changed, but it is still pretty good, interesting and entertaining.

I wonder for those who know nothing about this strange story, n 'having read or seen nothing if they hinder anything from this giant mess that occurs in the last third of the film. The end of the manga is also quite crazy in this respect but it is not as aberrant in comparison to this scenario that the three of them wrote: they must not have figured it out themselves, which explains there is doubt about that! Let us note, however, that the production is of good quality and that we are not bored in the least, including in the very ambient confusion. On the distribution side, the little guy is doing well, as is his pretty girlfriend (she looks like a little sister of Eva Green!) but why did ""L"" become a colored man who lives in Japan (?) teleports in Seattle and guess everything faster than light...? it makes no sense. In short, what a regrettable lack of rigor here and we would much prefer the Japanese adaptations, much clearer and more controlled than this American Death Note, and that's definitely a shame, because the subject itself remains as fascinating as ever.","DEC 1, 2019",4,Crime

The directing style is also clumsy and nothing out of the ordinary. A lot of third person shots from Ryuk's perspective, when he is not even there and it's useless. I didn't feel like the movie had pacing issues or dragging with the story, everything happened and unfolded right away, which was a god thing considering that it became boring pretty fast. The actors performance was almost the whole time exaggerated and broke off the little immersion the movie had. It wasn't very fun to watch neither entertaining. Also the 80's-90's styled music felt too forced and didn't fir at all the movie's environment and it's dark vibe. But the visual effects really looked good so credit is due there. Every single decision in the movie felt without consequence despite it's dramatic ending, which you could foresee almost from the intrigue. Also the plot was awfully simple, and louzy, but at least it wasn't cheesy. There is no humor in the movie which concludes to the fact that it takes it's self to seriously. There is a stable conclusion at the end, but it's just not enough to save the movie. So overall it's a painfully average movie, with almost every single main element being fundamentally flawed and broken. And my average rating is for the movie aspects only and not even considering the Manga on which is based on, and the accuracy of it, because then it would be a much lower rating.","SEP 19, 2018",5,Crime

Death Note,"It's worth a watch, but its logical inconsistencies may turn off fans of the original. It's not The Last Airbender or Dragonball Evolution levels of bad, but it does dumb down some of its source material to fit the 101 minute running time. ... Part of the original's strength was that, although supernatural elements existed, there were clearly defined rules, and every move the leads took was intelligently calculated. These rules are changed in this adaptation somewhat, most notably, a specified cause of death now needs only to be ""physically possible."" By that logic, why doesn't Light just make one of his victims draw an exact copy of L's face and name? For some reason, this never occurs to Light, probably because he too has been dumbed down. What made him so interesting in the series, in addition to possessing a genius level intellect, was that he was a model student; not someone you'd suspect of serial murder. Here, they made him into a troublemaker from the start, and he makes idiotic mistakes like openly reading and talking about the notebook in public places. Heart attack is not the default cause of death as in the anime, resulting in an unnecessarily gory film. Misa wasn't a strong character in the source material, and I have no idea why they tried to make her a pseudo Lady Macbeth here. It's almost as if she's making Light do these things, rather than focusing on his descent to evil. ... The setting change didn't bother me, because the story of Death Note could have happened anywhere. The characters, however, are often so different from the originals that I wonder why they bothered keeping their names. The real stars of the film are William Dafoe as Ryuk, (he's perfect in anything sinister to cartoony levels,) and Keith Stanfield as L, (he captures the air of his source character remarkably well.) The real problem is the short run time, which forces the plot to move at breakneck pace, and does not allow for the methodic intellectual chess game between Light and L. There's enough here to make me believe the actors could have made this shine through, but not with 1 hour 40 minutes. Instead of sequel baiting, perhaps more focus should have been placed on creating a better film. ... All that said, I was still able to enjoy myself watching this film, and that's because the concept is really good. What happens when a teenager is given the power to kill? At the very least, we get an answer to that question when the power falls to a cringy punk. As you might expect by the run time, it starts going bad for him pretty fast. The effects were decent, though more practical effects for Ryuk would have been appreciated. The music was hit or miss. I think if they slapped another hour on to really develop these characters and the plot, or cut Mia's character entirely, we could have had a better film, but as is, it's passable. Average.","AUG 25, 2017",5,Crime
Death Note,"I personally do not have an issue with director's choice of choosing a different story to follow since the Death Note may be owned by almost anyone in the world. The acting in the film is not a major issue, but L's actor and Light's father are sometimes too stiff when interacting with the other characters in the film. My major gripe with the film was the pacing, however. We are expected to believe that Watari and L have a deep relationship with each other from youth, and that Mia and Light are young lovers following her seeing the Death Note, but something about it seems wrong. Watari deserved more screen-time with L, and I feel that Mia's motives for wanting the Death Note are too extreme when compared to Light's own desires. The ending was slightly predictable in that Light would likely control what happens, but seeing it unravel was still enjoyable. There seems to be a lot of freedom concerning how deaths are controlled in this Death Note adaptation, much to the point that the characters' actions in the film seem unfair. In the ending, Light essentially cheated his death by controlling the paper his girlfriend, Mia, had previously written his name on by causing the paper to burn in a nearby fire. It was an enjoyable movie overall. The movie is not terribly bad as most people make it out to be, but it is no masterpiece either. If you are hell-bent on seeing an adaptation of the manga/anime, do not raise your hopes. The movie disappointingly falls short in engaging the audience as the anime/manga have done by opting for a more action-driven narrative. I am interested to see what a possible sequel might hold since the film ends on a cliff-hanger, but I do hope that characters in the film aside from Light are fleshed out more.","AUG 25, 2017",6,Crime

The movie doesn't know if it wants light to be the ultimate evil or good and doesn't give you any other side to root for if you find the anwser yourself. light has no charisma or strong motivation, he does not captivate. In the original series Death note, light has the strongest charisma and clear and defined motivation. This gave viewers a chance to either be hypnotized or completely turned off by him.

Light is said to be very bright multiple times but is never shown to be bright outside of math problems or doing homework for other kids which ends up with him getting caught and getting sent to detention (not very bright). So the movie lacks any genius plans or long thought out killings for the viewer to follow and figure out or be suprised by. This in turn creates another issue for the opposing force of L. L is never given any challenge or run around to solve and so his character is weakened because his defining factor,his supreme intelligence is lost as his quirks of eating candy,sitting positions, and matter of fact social awkwardness actually define him and so he is seen as a Weirdo who makes pretty obvious conclusions and is quick to anger instead of the cool and calm super genius who is going toe to toe with Kira. Misa or Mia in this movie is a step up from her air headed idol self to a cheerleader who is more of the i cheer cause i want to and smoke cigarettes while doing it type than the typical pretty and popular. I believe this character would have been more interesting as the main character. Mia is introduced to the death note by light and becomes addicted to the power of it. pushing light to do more killings and then working killings on her own. I think her power craze would make for a more interesting story then the typical western issue of tap dancing between morality with power. Finally Ryuk is the saving grace of this movie. A perfect adaption, ryuk's love for carnage, apples, and unclear motivations or loyalties shine through perfectly. Ryuk is for the most part hidden in shadow or unfocused lens but when shown his CGI is very well done. I hope this isn't the last we see of His live action character because he could be wonderful in better mediums. In summary, Netflix's death note is a shallow adaption of one of the greatest Suspense Thrillers in the world, with a weak main character in light who's addition to the plot seems to be the name connection to the original character, the naming of the villain Kira, and a very weak challenge for L to figure out. Weak and misused side characters and no one to root for, Watch this movie for ryuk and some interesting aesthetics, otherwise there is nothing here for even a boring rainy afternoon.","AUG 25, 2017",4,Crime

Death Note,"This film is far less awful than the flood of incensed fan reviews suggests; that's not to say it's very good, or even holds a candle to the source material (which I loved). It's seriously hurt by a 90 minute runtime which makes the story almost incomprehensible, and a script that's trying way too hard to be ""American teen movie"". Netflix's Death Note isn't completely without its moments though! There's some great performances (Ryuk and L mostly), and stylistically it's definitely cool.

The anime had (at least for it's first half) an extremely tense game of cat and mouse being played by characters that were incredibly intelligent and purposeful in their actions.

Instead, he's more emotional and jittery. It's like another story in the world of Death Note. It's like... they just gave up to get a wider and younger audience to like the movie.

Death Note,"The cultural phenomenon known as ""Death Note"" is a lot of material to try to turn into an hour and forty minute movie. So what we end up with is a film that goes for cheap thrills instead of a truly satisfying adaptation. You aren't going to get all of the well thought out twists and turns, shocking reveals, or deep looks at the characters and morals of the story. You will get treated to some gory kills and surprising sense of humor though. This is the kind of thing that is sure to break the hearts of longtime Death Note fans, likely regardless of how much of an open mind they have going into this. The movie's baffling tone and angst-driven teenage romance are just likely to turn of those who have not experienced the manga/anime. Adam Wingard seems to be content with almost parodying the source material. Rather than focusing on twisted, complex characters and the dark motives of it's lead character the movie is perfectly content to have us laugh at everything going on. I could deal with a more self-aware style that's willing to poke some fun at itself, but I can't tell if a lot of the humor was intentional or not. Is the movie actually trying to not take itself seriously, or failing miserably at delivering tension and thrills? Regardless of which is the case, the movie is funny for all of the wrong reasons. The more action-packed conclusion the film has does lead to a nice little twist though. So there is some payoff in the end. While Wingard can't carry the story or tone necessary to keep things afloat, he does deliver some visuals. The gore is ridiculously over-the-top, adding to that possibly unintentional comedic feeling the movie has, but it's still pretty entertaining to watch. Ryuk looks great and his scenes carry a cool mix of creepy and playful. Probably the thing from the anime and manga that the movie gets the most right. I also have to praise the casting. Nat Wolff, Lakeith Stanfield, and Willem Dafoe are pretty great in their roles as Light, L, and Ryuk respectively even if they aren't playing the same versions of the characters many of us know from the source material. Stanfield even manages to nail some of L's mannerisms. We also have Shea Whigham in a nice and very likable supporting role to help back things up. In the end though the strong cast can't make up for the lackluster writing. This also just isn't a good adaptation of the source material. It's a bad movie, but it's a watchable bad movie. When all is said and done I couldn't tell if I was laughing with it or at it, but it still managed to make me like a few of these characters who are basically originals despite having the recognizable names. I don't recommend watching it. Especially not if you are a fan of the real Death Note story. You won't be bored if you do decide to check it out. Just disappointed. There's so much more that could have been done here and better. 4.5/10","AUG 25, 2017",4,Crime

Death Note,"Bottom line, this movie needed to be a miniseries and not rushed into roughly an hour and a half movie. The pacing was too fast and it doesn't allow you to really connect with any of the characters in the movie. Another problem I had with this adaptation, which is what most people will point out is that they fundamentally changed the core attributes of the characters that they adapted from the anime series. For instance, Light was smart, but he wasn't genius level smart like he was in the anime series. He also wasn't very confident and the way they approached being ""Kira"" was completely different. Light, in the anime series, was all about creating and being the god of this new world order where crime will essentially be eliminated, and nothing and no one would stand in the way of that. This Light, just didn't have the stomach for it. Not to mention, Light, in the series, was the epitome of what every man wish they were, and every woman wished they were with. Light. in this movie, was remarkably average; even down to the reason for why he continuing to use the Death Note and pursued this life as Kira, all to impress a girl (Mia). What really made the anime series shine though, was the way Light and L danced a mental tango where Light was trying to either find a way to eliminate L or convince L that he wasn't Kira and L trying to get L to slip up so to confirm his suspicions that Light was Kira. In this movie, not so much; L confronts Light at a gelato shop, where he breaks Light to into letting it slip that he was Kira. This movie would have been better served if they cast a better Light, and didn't write him as such an unconfident wussy. Also, in the series, Ryuk and Lights relationship wasn't as adversarial as it was in this movie. In the series, Light and Ryuk was there for some side commentary and answer any questions that Light may have had in regards to the Death Note. In the movie, they really didn't like each other. Ryuk was the true star of this movie and because they played the relationship the way they did, his screen time was pretty limited. All in all, it's going to upset fans of the original anime series. To the point where they will flat out give this a ""0"" because of those differences. I think if you come in, never seeing the anime series, you'll find this movie to be remarkably average. That's why it's getting the oh so average score of a ""5"".","AUG 25, 2017",5,Crime

Death Note,"Not bad, but not great. Very minor spoilers. Based on review scores, I went into this expecting it to be another terrible adaptation of a popular anime, which Western film makers are infamous for. I was pleasantly surprised. It's hardly a 10/10 film of course, but the visual style was pleasant to my taste and fairly true to what I remember of the source material. I was most impressed with Ryuk, the death god. , and I thought the acting was decent at its worst moment. The plot suffered from trying to condense too much into one movie and without having read any in detail reviews yet, I suspect this is where most people have issues with the film. They weren't bad enough to completely break the film for me. I suspect fans of the anime are putting it on too high a pedestal. They seem to forget it had problems itself. The entire second half ****. Edit: Having read through several of the negative reviews, I can see a major gripe was the adaptation having a different plot from the original. I have no problem with this as long as the spirit of the original is captured, and I think it basically is. The core message of Death Note is that you can't make the world perfect. There is always some kind of catch, a lesser evil, or a cloud in every silver lining. I also see a lot of criticisms of how the characters were written and of the plot. These are legitimate, but I stand by my original argument that fans are being too hard on the adaptation and looking at the source material through the rose coloured glasses of nostalgia.","AUG 29, 2017",6,Crime
Death Note,"While the reputation is not as bad as critics and fans made it out to be, as someone that has not seen the anime, it's interesting but it has a ton of bad ideas! For one the pacing is rushed where it felt that the writers had to shove a ton of episodes in an hour and a half runtime, while also dragging and it feels like it is a lot longer than it should be. Not to mention that the main romance between Light and Mia feels forced and unnatural and all to conventional for the movie's own good. Hell having the romance being the central part of the movie instead of the titular book itself and the cat-and-mouse game between Light and L is honestly the worst decision they could have done. And with dialogue that is over-written and constantly on-the-nose it comes off as laughable as putting 80s soft-rock in integral scenes in the movie, especially towards the end with laughable uses of Chicago and Air Supply! There are some good here. Willam Dafoe as Ryuk and Lakeith Stanfield as L are good here, there is a few stylish shots and lighting that is alright, the gory death scenes are fun, and the soundtrack by Atticus and Leopold Ross does add a bit to the movie's atmosphere, but the movie has some serious issues with the movie's foundation that really on it's own just does not work. I doubt that the anime is like this, in fact I feel that the romance is a movie only idea, and really this might have been the best Netflix could have hoped for when making a Death Note movie based on the anime's premise alone. If there is one thing that the movie does right, it is getting my curiosity for the anime to peak and I do want to check it out.

Death Note,"Expecting a movie with a run time of less than 10% of the source material while still expecting 100% of the story is not only asinine, but inequitable (note this is the issue with most reviews under 5). The team led by Adam Wingard showed a considerate and attentive effort on reducing a complex story reliant on long term character development down to a short 1.5 hours. The real tragedy here is not that the story failed to be a copy and paste effort from its Japanese material, but instead that this adaptation was not expanded into an episodic series. I would have loved to see more of Willem Dafoe as Ryuk and to see a more subtle progression of Light turning towards Kira, but cuts and alterations to the story needed to be made in order to create a coherent and enjoyable movie. Hardcore fans will only enjoy scoffing at the inconsistencies from the anime or manga, but if you enjoyed Death Note casually years ago or are unfamiliar with the source material, then I would suggest giving this film a shot. Don't let the fanatics sway you away because this American version of a Japanese manga doesn't unrealistically follow the source material religiously. Not the greatest film, but it is certainly nowhere near the Dragonball Evolution levels the current rating suggests.","AUG 26, 2017",6,Crime

I knew this film was an epic fail the moment that Light screamed like a little girl at the sight of Ryuk. That scene was both depressingly painful and unintentionally hilarious to watch. Almost EVERY decision Light and L make in this movie are completely out of character from their anime counterparts and stupid beyond reason. Mia is essentially the exact opposite of her original version, instead of a light-hearted goth girl we get a psychotic cheerleader, ugh. The characters, the style, the plot, the intensity of the cat-and-mouse game, basically everything that made the anime so great is ruined in this film. Some of the death scenes are absurdly over-the-top as if the director just binge-watched the entire Final Destination series and thought the same formula would work here. Unfortunately Death Note is even worse than those films. The 80's music only makes it feel even cheesier, as they try to mimic Donnie Darko as well and still end up with a trashy teen horror flick. The movie even breaks the very rules of the Death Note itself. This isn't only a bad anime adaptation, it's just a bad movie period. Cringy dialogue, lame action set-pieces, terrible movie logic, and worst of all Ryuk is hardly even in it! Willem Dafoe is actually a good choice for Ryuk but he's portrayed as some kind of maniacal puppet-master, which is NOT what he ever was in the show.

Soul,"Soul is the latest new original Pixar Movie after a bad start with Onward after a series of sequels. How does Soul stand up? Really good! Now its not perfect, it does have issue such as the Joe and 22 Body switch with 22 in Joe's body and Joe in his cat's body has been done to death so many times and honestly it was hard for me to watch at that point because I was kinda uncomfortable watching stuff like 22 (as Joe) eating Pizza in a allyway or trying to be Joe, it just was super cringy. That and New York as a location has been done so many times. With That said, Soul is still a very powerful movie. The message about earth having something to offer everyone is relatable for anyone, the jazz elements make the film feel more grand, the ending where Joe gives up his chance to go back to earth to 22 was just wholesome and he got to go back to earth anyways, and it should a lot of relatable elements like wanting to impress our parents, and following our passions. Soul although as issues I addressed at the beginning of this review, is still a very strong, emotional film. Does it stand against the OG Pixar films? No but its a very good film and I recommend it.","FEB 7, 2021",7,Animation

Soul,"Some time around the late 2000s, Pixar Animation Studios ceased to be the ""can't do no wrong"" auteurs that produced thought-provoking hits after hits. Somewhere along the line, it lost its soul and was reduced to being just another movie studio. And so, the world watched as we awaited the day when Pixar returns to form. Perhaps it's due to this vigilance that imbues in us an extra layer of stringency in our criticisms. Ironically, the protagonist of Soul, Joe Gardner (Jamie Foxx), is very much like Pixar studios. He recognizes the craft, he knows it like the back of his hand, but he doesn't really understand the inner beauty of the music, the soul of jazz that embraces someone with the joys of life. He's too caught up in the technicality of the craft, too focused on textbook methods that make jazz function properly. That's what Pixar movies have been for the past decade, and even now in 2020, it's my opinion that Pixar hasn't returned to its peak yet. That cat comedy schtick, man, it really took away from what could've been the movie of my dreams, the one that I envisioned when I first watched the teaser to the film and what potential it could have as a story. But instead, we get fairly generic comedy routines stagnating the middle parts of the film instead of focusing on Joe and 22 (Tina Fey)'s enjoyment of everyday life. I wouldn't mind watching an entire arc of that stuff. Act 2 of the film just wasn't as potent as it should be due to its reliance on tired comedy routines when it could've just been an entire slice-of-life sequence celebrating the mundanities of ""regular ol' living."" But then comes Act 3, the final part of our tale, when Joe realizes what he has missed out or possibly forgotten in life, those very simple joys we take for granted: a new haircut, company with your dad, enjoying the morning breeze on a bike, sunrise, fireworks… and of course, the joy of opening a student's eyes to the wonders of life. You start to see during the final parts of the film what it should've been all along. You start to see what it could've been. And if that's not tragic enough, I didn't really like the final scene either. I feel like a stronger ending would've been Joe being led to his teaching career again, bookending the story with where he started as he learns to appreciate the simple things. As it is, the movie just feels unfinished, like an unpolished draft. To be clear, I think that 70% of the movie was well done. If you just cut out that 30% of comedy filler and focused more on building the atmosphere as Joe and 22 ride through the joys (and perhaps even the pains) of life, that would've been a stronger story. As it is, it's just another animated movie.","MAR 26, 2021",7,Animation

Soul,"Soul, beyond most films and animations made from the past to the present, deals with the meaning of life. This is not enough, and the main art of this animation is to make people think about life and how it is. Extremely strong animate, unique soundtrack, and excellent directing and editing are so accurate that the viewer does not notice them, and this is exactly what the artist's mission in film and animation is. To add value to a work of art without feeling its presence. The right characterization of Joe Gardner, a very strong script and a tremendous impact after watching the animation, is what makes you think and think about your life for a long time after it is over. Also, the type of display of pre- and post-mortem events for a child who is not familiar with these phenomena, is done beautifully and creates the best definition and mentality for them. Ultimately, this animation was not made for a specific age group, nor for a specific way of thinking, and everyone will feel deep pleasure in watching it.

All the while the creators are raking in the money for the movie while simultaneously getting people pumped for the new TV show. As for the movie itself it's not that bad, it may only please the younger Star Wars fans, but older fans can get into it if they keep an open mind. It's basically just one battle scene after another with a simple plot behind it, and even adds some lightsaber duels and some touches of humor here and there, and does a good job of introducing a few of the new characters that you will be seeing in the TV show.

Soul,"Soul is Pixar’s attempt to add humor to death under ironic circumstance. While playing fast and loose with the concept of birth, death and the afterlife, it often succeeds, but misses its opportunity to give life to itself with a truly worthy theme. Instead, Soul suggests that humans with a true purpose in life abandon their excellence in favor of acceptance and the world’s view of carpe diem. In short, it’s an attack on introverts and artists. While a somewhat entertaining film there are a dozen messages that are not especially positive for young viewers. As a piece of pure fiction, however, it delivers the typical feast of Pixar humor and humanity.","JAN 29, 2021",5,Animation

Star Wars: The Clone Wars,"What a marvelous idea, to make a film made of several episodes of the tv-show with the same name. George Lucas is full of surprises. ""Jar Jar is the key to all this"". The show starts in a very fast way with tonne of action and blasters coming from every direction. The plot is quickly introduced and we follow Anakin and Obi-Wan through the struggles of the war. My first impression is the cinematography, which is so smooth and well combined with the events that happen throughout the whole movie. The action is actually pretty good. It got some moments of intensity and entertainment and it does deliver. But this is only one part of it. Later on the plot becomes a bit ""meh""; it started to lack entertainment from a long-term perspective. It's no surprise why, it's the structure of the film that's the most crucial. Having three or four episodes of the tv-show with the same name combined into one film comes with some disadvantages. The tempo keeps going up and down over and over, and the plot keeps getting messier and messier. It shouldn't have been a movie, not by a long shot! The plot isn't as good as it could have been, but as a tv-show, it would have worked excellent! The negative aspects doesn't stop there; because the basics are very non-flawless. The characters are very well visualized but some of them does make very Illogical decisions, that they never would have done in the prequels. This is just for a few characters but it's so non-admirable to the source material. The main characters are good when it comes to interaction, but there are a lot of dry moments that could have been better. This includes the dialogs, which can be very dry, fact-based and very Lucas-alike (characters that show their emotions and tell what they think). That's a big flaw right there, we don't need to! We are human beings that can relate to characters through just a brief look at them. There are a few positive aspects with this show, and except for what just was mentioned; are the a lot of connections with the prequels, both details and twists to those films. The plot is as mentioned very messy, but it can still be entertaining with a good villain and a somewhat okay tempo of action. But the flaws are very big, and that includes the horrible CGI. This is coming from a 2008-movie where CGI is supposed to be well-developed. Even the early days were better. Still, some details like ships are still somewhat okay to look at, but the rest can be so horrible that it's barely watchable. The last aspect that really is bad is the editing, especially when it comes to action-sequences where frames can be disorientated and very horrible done in a very flawed way. There are very few long and constant shots and it therefor can feel too CGI-ish and not real. ""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" is one of the most flawed movies I've seen. But personally; do I still find it somewhat okay even though I've already forgotten mostly of the plot. Personal rating: 60/100 Critical rating: 36/100","OCT 31, 2015",6,Animation
Soul,"A huge step forward for Disney who continues to extend the cultural variety and diversity of its characters. This time we follow an old black man whose passion is jazz. Everything is far from being perfect in his daily life, especially the day he comes to die by accident. The story really begins at this point. I think this is truly ingenious and even thought it was going to be a far more interesting movie than I expected. Following a man in his fifties is awesome. Following a man struggling with life but who realizes that it could be worse is great. Following a man who dies by being not enough focus in the streets is promising. Following a man trying to make a living from music is profound. Soundtrack is as great as the animation. Pace in general is a bit weird with two serious slow and sleepy parts. Scenario was awesome at some point but ends up getting all messed up... The rest of the story we follow Joe Gardner's soul in heaven who obviously wants to come back to Earth as soon as possible. He comes up to encounter some disruptive elements allowing the movie to take a huge funny yet unnecessary journey to make the kids laugh because in overall this movie is really hard to understand for them. For example, creatures living in heaven are just human concept ideas and are wierdly represented. Without speaking about a particular religion this movie however question their existence and especially asks the question of life after death (and life before life). The ending is what made me lower the score so much. You don't die from nothing. Dying by accident doesn't make your death funnier, easier for your friends and family, less unexpected or even reversible. The major flaw of this movie is that it sweetens the reality of life too much. What would you have thought if Bambi's mother or Simba's father had woken up as if nothing had happened after being mortally wounded? Or the queen in 'White Snow'? Or Synndrome in 'The Incredibles'? 'Soul', in its core-story, is way too close to reality to allow itself to take death lightly. The fact it came out during COVID should have make the directors think more about it. If you want to sell dreams, sell real dreams, if you want to get closer to daily life, do it. But don't get piteously stuck in between. There were some truly attractive points in 'Soul' but when you consider it as a whole you easily realize it is falling into pieces.","JAN 6, 2021",6,Animation

Soul,"When I used to be a screenwriter type -- I'd sometimes write a story that was full of great ideas and such -- but at the end of the story it didn't nail the landing. For days I'd scratch my head and try to make parts of the story more spectacular. Which this film does to... no effect. Except that it makes matters worse. What I would then do is step back from MY story and act like it was written by someone else. What I would then do is go thru the 'rule book' (best practices of all great movies) and -- VOILA -- I'd discover broken rules. Everywhere. Listen. I'm not talking about formula. I hate formula too. I'm talking about best practices. Do tables work best with four legs? Yup. So did Soul include tables with four legs? Or did they get caught up in/very distracted by their 'wonderful' story and forget these best practices? That's a big YUP. The most appalling practice they violated was, ""Who's story is this?"" Like it or not, Pixar, every great story has one lead that the story belongs to. Did the Good Witch take over the story from Dorothy? Nope. Did Leia take over Luke's story? Nope. Did Buffalo Bob take over Starling's story? NOPE. So why does SOUL think 22's story is more interesting than Joe's? To the (painful) degree that 22 inserts herself inside of Joe? This is not a transgender story. It was a story about a black man and jazz and then SOUL throws that in the dumpster. So when this movie takes a victory lap for featuring a first black protagonist, think again. The morons are blissfully unaware that they got bored of that story and thought whitey ping pong ball Tina Fey was a better idea. Like I said, PAINFUL. Tina Fey's role was supposed to be 'the best friend'. That's the 'best practice'. The entity that helps Joe on his journey. SHE should have become the cat, not Joe. The other major misstep in this piece is what I call WRITERS WRITING ABOUT WRITING. Instead of telling a story for all of us -- they're telling their story. The obvious violation of this is when a story is about a writer writing a screenplay that gets produced and his girl decides to marry him because ""you're such a great writer!"" In SOUL Writers Writing About Writing is much better hidden. But it's there. You see the audience was pitched this story about a jazz musician. So what we wanted to see was a musician who goes 'into the zone' and makes us feel all warm and jazzy. Jazz, in this story, is really about being a Disney animator. Spending morning noon and night rendering crap on computers. This was hinted at in the scene where the stock broker is given a soul. Remember what he did the moment that happened? He pushed his PC and monitor off his desk and ran out of the room gleeful to be alive. In other words: ""Don't be a tool like me and sit in front of a computer all day. Go outside, in the sunshine, watch a leaf fall, and enjoy a slice of pizza!!!!"" This 'universal truth' is more an accidental recommendation of the story instead of an inspired goal. And really -- this viewer would have rather watched a musician find JAZZ and by doing so somehow unlock the secret of the universe. And I don't love jazz that much, mind you. It's just that -- -- yet another best practice is called 'If you put a gun on the stage -- use it."" The gun, in SOUL, is jazz. Which they trashed for a slice of pizza. This movie is being rated better than it should because black lives matter. But the cynical way this film blackspoited Joe to tell Tina's story is APPALLING. 5 stars is being generous. I'm giving this film a 5 but frankly it's not worth recommending or seeing again.","FEB 8, 2021",5,Animation

They tried to make it for all audiences and in the end, it isn't made for anyone.

Soul,"Truly complicated questions can't be simply answered Pixar has always been my favorite animation studio (along with Ghibli) and today I was lucky to watch ""Soul"" in a movie theatre: I can't say that I did not like ""Soul"", but it has a number of problems, which makes the overenthusiastic reviews from critics seem unjustified to me. ""Soul"" touches upon complicated philosophical issues (the issues of life and death, as well as the search for purpose and meaning of one's own existence), which, I felt like, are too difficult not only for children who will probably fall asleep in the cinema, but also for the authors themselves, who seemed to be confused, trying to understand what they want to tell the audience in the end. The answers and solutions to the (insoluble) existential questions offered by ""Soul"" seem to me somewhat unsatisfactory. Digging deeper than commercial animation filmmakers usually do, Pixar's scriptwriters have reached a level where any attempt to answer a question clearly and unequivocally, will look naive. In ""Soul"" there is A LOT of things that can get more and more confusing the more you think about logic of the world created by Pixar, but it gets even more embarassing when you realise what it lacks: for example, themes of love and loneliness, past which the storyline deftly maneuvers. It's difficult for me to agree with the formula ""love of life"" = ""the ability to enjoy little things and what we call ""routine"""" (A slice of pizza? Riding a bike?) = ""happy life."" I think this formula obviously lacks at least love, friendship and a sense of belonging to something greater than one's self. It's possible (and sometimes even useful) to speak simply about such complex things with adults and children, but to claim to be true in this case means to impose a point of view and even show a share of ignorance, leveling thousands of years of the history of the development of existential philosophy. However, it's still a unique and enjoyable animated film that was fun for me to watch. I think it is better to stay at this level of perception and not try to unravel the tangle, which neither Nietzsche, nor Sartre, nor Kierkegaard, nor the authors of ""Soul"" managed to do successfully.","DEC 30, 2020",6,Animation

The series is also slower, not slow but slow, it takes moments to get the characters to talk and evolve. There is none of that here and what little there is doesn't feel natural at all. Asooka and Anakin interact as if they have known each other for a long time with a very trusting apprentice-master relationship, but in context they have only met a few hours ago. Furthermore, all the dialogue that in the series is interesting and takes more time, here, they change it for constant fights and they become boring. I wasn't expecting something like an episode of the saga acted out in real life, but I was expecting something more than just one extremely long episode with fights. It is literally that, an episode to which they added more fights to lengthen its duration from 1-2 episodes to a movie. 04/10","NOV 18, 2015",4,Animation
Soul,"First of all nice idea but just that, there is nothing more, even not deep emotional moments. just a nice idea and they just wanned to put it in your mind ok enjoy of every single minutes of your pathetic life even walking what next. there was no creativity in **** comparison to up or inside out it's disappoiting.","JAN 3, 2021",5,Animation
Soul,"Amazing visuals, snappy dialogue, interesting characters, lacking story, deplorable protagonist, and an ending that doesn't provide closure. I'd say I barely enjoyed watching it and will probably not see it another time. This movie honestly feels like it's trying to imitate Pixar's Inside Out, but does so with disingenuous material and does it poorly. We follow our main guy Joe along his life being obsessed with music and finally getting the gig he wants only to fall into a sewer and die. From there we get to see the Great Beyond and the Great Before; terms that become problematic when talking about any actual afterlife that the movie makes neatly side step by saying that's all in the beyond. Joe is able to avoid the Beyond (only to put a time limit on his actions and to trick him into thinking he's special) and escapes to the Before, where he proceeds to get back to his body even at the cost of stealing other's lives. Joe constantly shows he's selfish and doesn't care about others and only changes after he destroys a life and only through Deus Machina fixes it. Combined with a lot of psych nonsense rhetoric, anti-christian hints, and naive view of life makes this movie feel like a way of tricking the next generation the way Disney did the previous: feelings are all that matter.","DEC 25, 2020",4,Animation
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,"The beginning part of this movie is good, but it all falls short toward the middle and end.","MAR 10, 2019",4,Animation
Soul,"Foxx and Fey do a wonderful job with natural chemistry and that is really the only good I have to say about it. The plot was as predictable as the trailer made it out to be and that I felt took away a lot from it overall. And the music didn't leave a lasting impression as other Disney films do. Also shockingly is that for a movie that is less than 90 minutes, It really dragged at times and hit far too many cliches over the course of the film.","DEC 25, 2020",3,Animation
Norm of the North,"This “movie” was #TotesRetar in the worst way imaginable. It’s barely even a movie, let alone a good one.","DEC 14, 2020",0,Animation
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,"Originally intended to be a series of episodes for the eventual TV show, The Clone Wars ultimately was a poor decision to create as a movie. It introduces characters that will play well down the road, but this movie is disjointed and lacks a cohesive vision for how to be satisfying in a cinematic sense. See this movie if you want the origin story for Asokha Tano, Anakin's bratty padawan who slowly wins you over through several seasons of the strange but fun CGI animated series.","DEC 15, 2017",3,Animation
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,"""Star Wars: The Clone Wars"" ultimately cannot bring enough to match itself with its live-action franchise, and its story lacks much of the wit put into their world. With its constant usage of action, without finess, the film suffers to be nothing more than a movie made to make a few bucks. Though kids will be fine with it, older kids and adults will probably want to spend their money on other movies out there.","JUL 25, 2013",3,Animation
Soul,"High-concept, yet uninteresting to watch. The story in the ""real world"" of the movie was wonderful to look at and experience, but most of the film takes place in a nonsense color-scape. I also found it borderline unbelievable that when the Soul of a white woman took over the body of a black man, she solved all of his problems in one day. It felt like it went against any stronger message the film tried to portray.","DEC 16, 2023",2,Animation
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,"While it would thankfully follow with a far better animated series, this original theatrical debut of The Clone Wars is dull, lifeless dreck filled with obnoxious characters.","MAR 3, 2022",2,Animation
Norm of the North,"The animation brings it down a lot. The writing brings it down even more. The voice acting takes it to the ground. The fact that it exists brings it beneath the ground, melting it inside the mantle's apathetic magma.","FEB 5, 2017",1,Animation
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,"This was utterly painful to sit through. Don't get me wrong I LOVE STAR WARS, but this isn't the Star Wars that we loved back in our childhoods. Where did all this go wrong? My guess is that George Lucas wanted to extend the lifespan of Star Wars merchandising by making a new Star Wars movie made up of the first 3 or 4 episodes The Clone Wars TV series, only to expand on the merchandising when the series came out. This is not Star Wars. This is Star Wars: The Bored Wars. The battles are not exciting or engaging; they are the most formulaic thing in the film, and there is nothing much to add aside from how poorly edited this movie really was. Hell, the episodes, if they were kept in their original forms, would probably be just as bad as before even without the clumsy sandwiching they used to put them together in one under-produced film.","OCT 25, 2012",2,Animation
Norm of the North,"OH MY GOD. Terrible jokes, terrible voice acting, terrible story, and terrible animation. A twerking Polar Bear twerking to humans in the arctic. Wouldn't recommend this film on my worst enemy. This is a new low for cinema","MAY 19, 2017",2,Animation

Norm of the North,"The animation looks like garbage, the characters are stupid, unlikeable and hateable, annoying, serve no purpose and even blad, generic and one dimensional.

Soul,"They obviously tried to repeat the success of ""inside out"" but in my opinion, it's a failure to launch. It's derivative, insipid, uninspired and boring. 2/10 for the voice acting.","DEC 26, 2020",2,Animation
Norm of the North,"Norm of the North is more like Norm of the They Never Should Release this on Theaters.

Norm of the North,"Norm Of The North is a Artwork of Failure, a masterpiece of incompetence as well as nightmare images and twirking bears going to the city to SAVE THE ARTIC. This Movie is so bad I’m actually going into spoilers so if you somehow want to insanely WATCH this movie For entertainment purposes do it Blind so I can review a Decent movie that doesn’t rip off the minions violently shoved in furry costumes. Believe me when I say it hammers in this poorly executed message about saving the environment, which to be fair is a good moral, but they handled it horribly. It’s rubbish. The Bad Guy might as well have his “How Bad Can I Possibly Be” In this Movie because that’s his purpose. This movie has a cast of bland and uninteresting characters animated horribly just like how Dexter Scaretetive and that Horrific THING moved around in Foodfight. I know I was rough to this movie. But the movie made every artic Dance personal so I might as well dance along with Lockwood, Drack and Gene and do The MojiPop in this trainwreck you need skill to make. Do not watch this movie. It’s not even a movie. It’s a Thing. To quote from Toy Story (a much better animated film) “[Norm Of The North] is a thing. A stupid little insignificant thing.”","DEC 20, 2019",0,Animation
Soul,"I was really looking forward to this but I found the story lacking in both depth and logic. Visually lush, musically fantastic but it cannot hide a story that lacks originality, and a movie that tries way to hard to be charming.","AUG 11, 2021",2,Animation
Norm of the North,"Quite possibly the worst animated film ever made. 'Norm of the North' is unfunny, not clever, not educational, stale and just down-right awful. The film barely has a plot, it barely has characters worth caring about or remembering. It barely even has structure, at times, the editing is so choppy, you can't keep track of the film's narrative. I am just going to keep this review short, this has got to be one of the worst movies out there for children. Not worth to punish your child over.","JUL 6, 2017",1,Animation
Star Wars: The Clone Wars,"I suppose this movie was intended for a younger audience, seeing as the rating bar cannot go any lower. I consider this film to be the most despicable, disgraceful, dishonorable, disgusting, disenchanting, disregarding, demoralizing, dismal piece of **** I have ever seen. George Lucas, why did you have to go throw up on the Star Wars saga and then take a BIG @$$ **** ON IT?!?!?!","MAY 7, 2011",0,Animation
Soul,Visually compelling scenes on Earth interspersed with graphic **** of both the visual and philosophical kinds - when exploring the befores and afters of life on Earth. The movie introduces a lot of threads and leaves many of them untied at the end and many that are tied are tied off in a “wrong” and unsatisfying way. And what about Lisa? She is Chekov’s gun.,"DEC 26, 2020",3,Animation
Norm of the North,"I heard this film was terrible but I didn't expect it to be that bad. the movie at first was just generic bad but as the film went on, I got a sick feeling in my stomach. The sickness wasn't from any gross-out humor or something vile and vulgar the characters were doing but at the thought that this film shows what utter contempt Hollywood has for the movie-going audience and your children. I started to hate this film but by the end this film disgusted me in a way I never felt before. This is perhaps one of the worst movies I have ever seen somehow make it to the silver screen and get some budget and shows that they think we are a bunch of idiots that will lap up whatever they crank out, but boy are they wrong with me. This film is so bad it makes me respect Jack and Jill, perhaps one of the worst big budget films ever made and shows similar contempt for its audience but this film goes one step farther by targeting children. Personally it should be a challenge for all folks out there to destroy all physical copies of this movie as a civic duty to society","JUL 31, 2016",1,Animation
Norm of the North,"Ugh. Anything but this movie. I remember watching this in theaters a few years ago, and hating it. The jokes are mildly annoying at best, and the animation is just bad.
