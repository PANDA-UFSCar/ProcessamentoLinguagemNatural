I have rarely been so taken by the mystery of a film during my first cinema session.   \n","1

If you wanted a science fiction action blockbuster then you will be disappointed. However it is one of the most brilliant plots in scifi. I won’t spoil the details but once you understand the twist it’s just magnificent. It is a movie worth to discuss with friends and very memorable because it does something completely different. The ideas for follow up stories are basically endless. It is based on the book “The story of her life” if I am correct. Also all actors were the right choices for their respected rolls. I think this will be a forgotten masterpiece because it is not mainstream enough. Sorry for not going in in details, but it will ruin the movie. Think about the twist in “The sixth sense”. If someone spoiled it for you the movie would be less good (or a lesser experience?).   \n","3                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Arrival is one of my favorite Sci Fi movies of all time. The movie doesn't need flashy action sequences or superficial Drama to deliver a thoughtful and emotional experience. Even the \"plot twist\" if you may call it that is in clear service of the story and not just a plot twist for the sake of it. Arrival manages to connect with me every time I watch it. I think this is some of the best that Sci Fi has to offer.   \n","4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 I don't think this movie is about that \"what makes us human\". Personally I think it is about creating your own reality. The whole movie developes around the ability of a character to understand a language. In a way, Adams' character is a child (humanity) learning to speak. She has to go through all the tribulations of learning a new language, a powerful one at that. The premise is quite interesting and it took me two views to get it: Your language (the way you express what you think) determines your reality. They even mention it at the beginning of the movie, with the Sapir-Whorf theory. This is by far a very metaphysical proposal, and a very adecuate one at that, one that has been told to us by great master of ancient (\"For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned\"). In a way, language IS reality, it is the only way we have to describe it and thus create it. So it would make sense that a more powerful language would create a different, more powerful reality. In the movie, learning the aliens' language would opne the doors of time and space for you, and this can be wither a weapon (as first understood by humans) or a gift, as later realized by Adams. Of course the ability to thread between past, present and future could be a powerful weapon, or a great gift. Once she realizes this, it is quite interesting that she still chooses to have her baby, aware of the outcome, but the most important choice she makes, while having the ability to visit the past or future, is to live in the present. Powerful message indeed. So now you know, choose your words carefully.   \n","5                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Arrival is a sci-fi film only in presentation, as the film explores deeper themes of human communication and aggressiveness. While Arrival’s initial presentation may seem jarring and somewhat flawed, as the movie progresses and the twist is revealed, the editing choices and the pseudo-confusing sequencing end up contributing to the movie's meaning as a larger whole. Arrival explores various linguistic and psychological theories and takes them to an extreme, even using them as the crux for its storytelling. While it does benefit the viewer to be familiar with psychological concepts, especially linguistic determinism, the film does a good job explaining the fundamental concepts the story is based upon. Arrival is not only a cautionary tale but also a hopeful one. Arrival purports that through cooperation and coordination, i.e. through avoiding competition, a future which benefits more to a greater degree can be achieved. In this way, Arrival is a greatly anti-capitalist film presented in a widely digestible way. Villeneuve is a highly-skilled director, and, with Arrival, he shows that he can blend genres and excel while doing it.   \n","6                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 One of the best movies of the past 10 years.

I liked the nostalgic flashbacks shown, a reminder of childrens curiosity and wonder when faced with seeing certain things for the first time. Its a relatively atmospheric film, with looming music used in the background, not dissimilar to that present in other previous sci-fi films, most notably Close Encounters of the Third Kind. It also reminded me somewhat of Jodie Foster in the film Contact from the 1990s. Its a somewhat deep film that makes you think about how threats are handled, at a global level, the responses by various governments and the like. If anything, I found it refreshing that in this instance, the US didn't exactly go in 'all guns blazing' and I appreciated that the main character, Louise Banks, tries very hard to understand and see things from the unknowns' point of view. I don't think I can say much more but suffice to say, I recommend this film.   \n","12                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The most intelligent film ever.

Though provoking and clever movie that showcases the acting talents of Adams as well as arguably the brightest and most consistent director in Hollywood, Denis Villeneuve.   \n","15                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Phenomenal movie. I wouldn't have watched this movie if I hadnt known about the intriguing ending (yes I was spoiled but I don't mind). I've never been a fan of Amy Adams in Superman or Jeremy Renner in Marvel but the story, delivery and slow pacing really punches this movie high. I wasn't disappointed at all. It has never a dull moment and there are many parts I can rewatch many times just to think about how they unfold. Lots of small details to look out for too like Abbot's actions before something happens. This movie is right up there with District 9, Contact, The Martian and Interstellar.   \n","16                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Twelve black, shell-like spaceships land in twelve different locations around the world. The American government, in the person of Colonel Weber (Forest Whitaker), sends the linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) and the mathematician/physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) to find out what the aliens want. The other nations have a different plan and it is important to keep the peace. Arrival is a great science fiction film with the theme: landing of aliens. Treated differently than most blockbuster films. In most films, the objects are immediately shot at and the aliens attack. At Arrival everyone acts rationally and wants to find out what kind of objects they are and what the residents want. As a viewer, you think about what it could be and whether the residents are evil. What the film does particularly well is the visual implementation and the sound. The aliens look scary and could be from a horror movie. The tension is well maintained and it never gets boring. The beginning of the film is very emotional, which I didn't expect. The way they try to communicate is very interesting and well done and everyone tries to interpret something for themselves. I guessed some of the film's twist, but I was still shocked and didn't expect some things. The ending, like the beginning, is very emotional and beautiful. Ian's character isn't highlighted much, the film focuses more on Louise, whereas Ian seems to just be there to make the ending work. 9/10   \n","17                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The best thriller/sci-fi film I have ever seen in my life. The work behind the camera by Denis Villeneuve is majestic. The concept behind the origin and the meaning of the \"aliens\" is absolutely original in every shape. The work made by Joe Walker in the sound editing with the beautiful shots made by Brandon Young gave that little touch to the film to make it feel smoother.   \n","18                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      At half way through the movie it felt terribly boring and it was like just the quest to find the signs of aliens but that ending changed my opinion suddenly it went to the peak!Awesome score since start of the film i was too much into the music awesome score,acting.most of time it felt boring even though the suspense of whats aliens try to tell and ending makes it a good movie!

An interesting premise and cerebral plot more focused on language and geopolitical relations than the aliens themselves. The movie also respects the science that it dives into and doesn't use it as a simple plot contrivance like many action sci-fi movies do. I was left with a feeling of hope and intrigue after finishing it.   \n","25                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Awesome !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Lots of sitting around discussing things and not much else going on. I found the main character too self absorbed to be likable so I couldn't get invested in her. The whole thing was very self-important but the payoff wasn't worth it. It shares the same faults as Denis Villeneuve's other movies, such as blade runner 2049 and Dune - visually striking imagery and great soundtrack but the movie is ultimately long and dull.   \n","27                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  What humanity needs is to strive for a common goal. I love science fiction because it can paint somewhat realistic scenarios like ARRIVAL, in which our planet is saved by extraterrestrial intervention. But more real than our first alien contact is the way ARRIVAL depicts a planet divided by invisible borders and nations unwilling to cooperate. God I love this movie.   \n","28                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Arrival is a modern Sci-Fi. Both in the good and in the bad sense of the word. Arrival is spectacular and beautiful to attract a large audience, and moderately stupid not to scare away the mass audience. Excellent cast, one of the best roles of Amy Adams. Arrival should be watched only in the original, Arrival about linguistics, so dubbing completely changes the idea of the film. Arrival is a vivid example of popularizing Sci-Fi in wide circles, but only because it is a bad example of the genre. Arrival is too simple and stupid. If you want a real Sci-Fi, watch Annihilation. Of course, the Arrival movie is not worse, and it looks even better for most people, but when they say that this is one of the best Sci-Fi about exploring extraterrestrial life, you catch only irritation.   \n","29                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Arrival is one of the best sci-fi movies ever made. Everything from Amy Adams'performance to the design of the ships, the aliens, the concept of the time, and how we perceive it, is extraordinary.

As others have said, it is slow. Also, it feels like they just did a wikipedia search for \"linguistics\" and then wrote a script around the first paragraph. I don't see this as a cerebral sci fi film at all. More of a cheesy, slog-fest.   \n","31                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        I went to see this because when I arrived at the theatre Arrival was the only movie that just started. I liked Jeremy Renner in other movies like The Town, so I thought I would watch this one. I was pretty disappointed and could not give more than a 6. It seems he did not get enough acting in and even looked quiet at times like his lines were cut out. I don't see him in a romantic role either and the music was too overwhelming for me. It is an interesting idea but I don't believe the writing was really there, her flashbacks were predictable, and you knew what was going to happen. One of those films basically you know as the ones that rely on the CGI to get the ticket sales which is a losing concept to me.   \n","32                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               This is a science fiction movie about aliens visiting our planet. Or rather about attempts the mankind takes trying to establish a contact with aliens. The movie is done quite professionally, and I liked it's cinematography and sound track. There are good actors starring there (Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner, Forest Whitaker), and they deliver adequate performance. Most of the movie kept me interested. Sometimes pseudo-philosophical lingo carried me away. I think the movie was too long, and the script has not been thought through, leading to nowhere. Which is a shame, it had a lot of potential.   \n","33                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The movie is very aesthetically pleasing to look at. There are a lot of great visual set pieces here. But as far as that, the movie never really transforms into anything more than a slice of life. Yes, the woman knows what'll happen in the next few years by the end of the movie, but what does she say to the guy that would happen to? The moral of the story is to live life even if it means going through heartbreak, but if feels hollow as it all felt avoidable to a degree and yet also in some ways makes the inevitability of the situation even worse. It's hard to say without spoiling, but it's decent to below average (a 6 rather than a 7). The soundtrack is probably the only other above average thing about this movie, though, very etherial and melancholy. God rest the soul of the composer.   \n","34

understand. well at least our leaders wont any way.   \n","35

a sci-fi buff I was anxious to see this film. It was not all I hoped it would be. Repeated scenes over & over lost the interest of the audience as I could feel. The acting was average and the sub plot was difficult to follow. Just couldn't rate it as some have.   \n","36  Lets starts honest I really liked Arrival. Until it turned weird. Then, not so much anymore. With a class A cast including Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker this should have been a great movie all the way to the end. Except that it wasn’t. It was a great movie until it stopped being that. I had high hopes for it and as such I was left slightly disappointed. Arrival is a good story with a ton of potential for greatness until it got whacked on the head and it all went belly up. For some reason I can’t help comparing it to the 1997 movie Contact, starring the iconic Jodie Foster, which kind of had the same problem. Great movie with a great story until the moment it went all pear shaped. The Story Twelve pods of unknown makeup and origin have appeared overnight at seemingly random locations around the globe. As to be expected the media goes nuts and social services break down. School is out. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is a successful linguistics professor who stands in from of an empty class room the next day. She highly regarded in her field and has done highly classified consultancy work for the government in the past. Because of this it comes as no big surprise when she gets approached by the military. They need her help in decoding the language of the aliens and once that is done they want her to establish communications with the visitors. For this mission she gets a team of people and works closely together with Ian Donnelly, a theoretical physicist, portrayed by Jeremy Renner. All twelve pods have positioned themselves at seemingly arbitrary coordinates all over the world. The local governments are scrambling to establish contact with the aliens and try to learn as much as they can about ‘their’ pods. They all have a fall out about how to proceed and one by one they end up shutting down communication with the rest of the world. Everyone is now acting isolated without knowing what the others are doing or how far they are with their work to decipher the purpose of the visit. This of course creates an explosive situation that threatens to get out of hand when gossip has it that the Chinese are contemplating to nuke their pod in search for answers. This of course is not an ideal situation for anyone, as no one knows if and how the aliens or the neighbours, for that matter, will retaliate. Here is where it went wrong In between her work Louise has these strange flashbacks to her family, mainly her daughter. Except that we learn she doesn’t have a family nor a daughter. These flashbacks are just that, but that the events have not actually happened yet. They will happen in the future. And that, because she now speaks the aliens language, time doesn’t follow in a straight line for her anymore but in parallel strings all mixed up. Say what? This is where is turned south for me. I am good with weird and strange. But that was too much for me. In that moment the movie lost its credibility in my eyes. I know there are concepts out there about time and space and astro physics. In fact I am very interest in the subject. I have read several read books and listened to countless podcasts about it. But the way it was done in the movie is just ridiculous. I am very sorry. Final thoughts I suppose we can draw similarities to todays society, which is rather trigger happy. We constantly on the cusp **** catastrophe even without the presence of aliens. This raises the question of what will it take for humankind to step back from the abyss. What is needed for people to start working together instead of against each other? Arrival also touches on another question. A moral one that people ask themselves daily. If you knew the future and the way your life would turn out to be, would you change anything? If you knew that by accepting the greatest gift and joy you would ever get, you would also set yourself up the the most desperate pain. Would you still chose the same path? Its a powerful message.

As for the ending, meh just psychobabble.   \n","39                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Can I be honest? This movie doesn't have any sense? What \"precious\" message aliens have for the Humanity? after half hour I completely lost interest watching the movie that was turning into a no sense plot. After Indipendece day any other Sci-Fi movies has been able to be plausible (for what possible), exciting and with a simple as much as deep story.

So there's a written language that induces clairvoyance. Sounds stupid when saying it out loud , right. So if the whole point was to teach us this written language, why didn't they start with that? Why was it Amy Adams who starts trying to communicate through writing? If they can see the future, why do they let one of themselves die? Forgetting the phone call to the Chinese general, a major plot point? Also, the twist is a bit predicable, not horribly, but you can guess it before the reveal. Poor execution has really detracted from this movie. If you're going to make a film, do it properly!   \n","41                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               On the one hand, yet another damn flick about aliens coming down! On the other, one that is fairly restrained, intelligent and serious with an original thought provoking premise. The slow unraveling mystery is good. The conventions of the sub-genre that still aren't transcended here are not, nor is some of the sentimentality. Alas it is not that bold after all. Would a real scientist constantly dealing in mathematics and numbers upon reading .083 say, \"point oh eight three\" and not \"point zero eight three\"? If he is played by a sloppy actor taking sloppy direction perhaps. Or such a real scientist saying oh instead of zero might just need to be fired and lose grants.   \n","42                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          As if realistic alien contact is not difficult enough on its own to depict, Arrival also tries to incorporate \"time travel\", hence doubling-down on its failure to portray a convincing sci-fi narrative. Beyond the fresh but failed attempt with the linguistic aspect, this film is far below Contact in every regard, and only a truly numb mind can look beyond the glaring illogicalities and senseless plot. To be more specific and to name some key points: aliens come to the planet physically but do absolutely nothing? Anthropocentric madness. Time travel into the past without addressing the paradox? Americans being the only \"good guys\" of the human race? A pathetic accidental misunderstanding of a common word (in English) being the plot device that results in the culmination? Mediocre acting and a pointless plot for a very forgettable film that, I'm sure \"fans\" don't even recall anymore. Watch the Contact instead.   \n","43                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I don't mind that the film is slow. 2001 is a slow movie and I love every frame of it. This movie is boring at times. I looked at my watch a couple of times. I don't believe we could decipher the complex symbols as quickly as they did, and I always have to wonder why super intelligent beings have a hard time learning our language(s). I also felt ZERO chemistry between the two leads. I also thought about the movie \"Contact\" several times as there is too many similarities. On the positive side, the visuals are striking at times, and Amy Adams is wonderful, as she is in every film she is in.   \n","44                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               The aliens have returned. This time in cool-looking, mysterious crafts that hover above the earth in 12 places. Amy Adams is the expert linguist (with a troubled past?) who's brought in to try to establish communications with the mysterious creatures. This film's concepts for otherworldly design are intriguing, but after seeing the film, the reason for their visit is still hazy. While there's lots of enticing set up, the proceedings move slowly to a repetitive and frustrating crawl before it's over. To make matters worse, the ending may leave you flummoxed. (Some internet research helped explain it.) While the premise is certainly fascinating, the dwindling pace and lack of much tension results in a less-than-satisfying outcome to this untraditional extraterrestrial narrative.   \n","45                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  I had so many high expectations from this movie, but they all fell into the drain after the end of the movie.

It bored me a lot, I wouldn't watch it again and I don't think it deserved to be among the best films.   \n","48                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Weird and complex, strangely engrossing, but not entertaining. A big problem was that you couldn't understand what they were saying half the time, but maybe that was a good thing. And, as for meaning, who knows? Certainly no 2001 or Close Encounters. I suppose it had something to do with the meaning of life. Unfortunately, too much pat Hollywood story lines as well.   \n","49                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         In his first foray into sci-fi, Villeneuve's lofty ambitions are as over-calculated as they are under-executed. Arrival is far from the promised humanist thriller, coming across as a wannabee Nolan thinker, only less coherent and more pretentious. After the abominations of Enemy and Sicario, this may just be strike 3 for Denis.   \n","\n","      Created at  Score    Genre  \n","0    OCT 3, 2022   10.0  Mistery  \n","1    MAR 7, 2022   10.0  Mistery  \n","2    DEC 6, 2019   10.0  Mistery  \n","3    APR 3, 2020   10.0  Mistery  \n","4    MAR 2, 2020    8.0  Mistery  \n","5    MAY 2, 2020    9.0  Mistery  \n","6   SEP 19, 2023   10.0  Mistery  \n","7   JUN 10, 2021   10.0  Mistery  \n","8   JAN 23, 2023   10.0  Mistery  \n","9   MAR 22, 2021   10.0  Mistery  \n","10  OCT 21, 2021   10.0  Mistery  \n","11  NOV 20, 2021    8.0  Mistery  \n","12  DEC 12, 2021   10.0  Mistery  \n","13  APR 18, 2020    9.0  Mistery  \n","14   JAN 5, 2021    9.0  Mistery  \n","15  DEC 27, 2019    9.0  Mistery  \n","16  APR 26, 2023    9.0  Mistery  \n","17   APR 8, 2020   10.0  Mistery  \n","18   APR 1, 2020    7.0  Mistery  \n","19   NOV 9, 2022   10.0  Mistery  \n","20  FEB 24, 2023    9.0  Mistery  \n","21  JAN 10, 2021   10.0  Mistery  \n","22  APR 22, 2020    7.0  Mistery  \n","23  MAR 21, 2022   10.0  Mistery  \n","24  MAY 31, 2020   10.0  Mistery  \n","25   SEP 4, 2022   10.0  Mistery  \n","26   JAN 9, 2023    7.0  Mistery  \n","27  MAR 25, 2019    9.0  Mistery  \n","28  JUN 10, 2023    9.0  Mistery  \n","29  FEB 12, 2022   10.0  Mistery  \n","30  NOV 12, 2016    5.0  Mistery  \n","31  NOV 15, 2016    6.0  Mistery  \n","32  NOV 13, 2016    5.0  Mistery  \n","33  MAY 13, 2021    6.0  Mistery  \n","34   JUN 1, 2023    6.0  Mistery  \n","35  NOV 15, 2016    5.0  Mistery  \n","36  DEC 25, 2016    5.0  Mistery  \n","37  JAN 19, 2017    4.0  Mistery  \n","38  MAY 24, 2020    4.0  Mistery  \n","39  NOV 12, 2016    5.0  Mistery  \n","40   DEC 4, 2016    6.0  Mistery  \n","41  NOV 25, 2016    6.0  Mistery  \n","42   JUL 3, 2019    6.0  Mistery  \n","43  NOV 27, 2016    6.0  Mistery  \n","44  NOV 16, 2016    6.0  Mistery  \n","45   FEB 4, 2017    5.0  Mistery  \n","46   SEP 8, 2023    4.0  Mistery  \n","47  NOV 16, 2017    6.0  Mistery  \n","48  DEC 29, 2016    5.0  Mistery  \n","49  FEB 22, 2017    4.0  Mistery  "],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-14609dde-5412-4320-9693-9265c2d1e378\" class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","    <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>Movie name</th>\n","      <th>Review</th>\n","      <th>Created at</th>\n","      <th>Score</th>\n","      <th>Genre</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>Arrival</td>\n","      <td>Denis villeneuve shows us all his talent in this film which is for me his best : science fiction is used in the best way.

Personally I think it is about creating your own reality. The whole movie developes around the ability of a character to understand a language. In a way, Adams' character is a child (humanity) learning to speak. She has to go through all the tribulations of learning a new language, a powerful one at that. The premise is quite interesting and it took me two views to get it: Your language (the way you express what you think) determines your reality. They even mention it at the beginning of the movie, with the Sapir-Whorf theory. This is by far a very metaphysical proposal, and a very adecuate one at that, one that has been told to us by great master of ancient (\"For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned\"). In a way, language IS reality, it is the only way we have to describe it and thus create it. So it would make sense that a more powerful language would create a different, more powerful reality. In the movie, learning the aliens' language would opne the doors of time and space for you, and this can be wither a weapon (as first understood by humans) or a gift, as later realized by Adams. Of course the ability to thread between past, present and future could be a powerful weapon, or a great gift. Once she realizes this, it is quite interesting that she still chooses to have her baby, aware of the outcome, but the most important choice she makes, while having the ability to visit the past or future, is to live in the present. Powerful message indeed. So now you know, choose your words carefully.</td>\n","      <td>MAR 2, 2020</td>\n","      <td>8.0</td>\n","      <td>Mistery</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5</th>\n","      <td>Arrival</td>\n","      <td>Arrival is a sci-fi film only in presentation, as the film explores deeper themes of human communication and aggressiveness. While Arrival’s initial presentation may seem jarring and somewhat flawed, as the movie progresses and the twist is revealed, the editing choices and the pseudo-confusing sequencing end up contributing to the movie's meaning as a larger whole. Arrival explores various linguistic and psychological theories and takes them to an extreme, even using them as the crux for its storytelling. While it does benefit the viewer to be familiar with psychological concepts, especially linguistic determinism, the film does a good job explaining the fundamental concepts the story is based upon. Arrival is not only a cautionary tale but also a hopeful one. Arrival purports that through cooperation and coordination, i.e. through avoiding competition, a future which benefits more to a greater degree can be achieved. In this way, Arrival is a greatly anti-capitalist film presented in a widely digestible way. Villeneuve is a highly-skilled director, and, with Arrival, he shows that he can blend genres and excel while doing it.</td>\n","      <td>MAY 2, 2020</td>\n","      <td>9.0</td>\n","      <td>Mistery</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>6</th>\n","      <td>Arrival</td>\n","      <td>One of the best movies of the past 10 years.

I liked the nostalgic flashbacks shown, a reminder of childrens curiosity and wonder when faced with seeing certain things for the first time. Its a relatively atmospheric film, with looming music used in the background, not dissimilar to that present in other previous sci-fi films, most notably Close Encounters of the Third Kind. It also reminded me somewhat of Jodie Foster in the film Contact from the 1990s. Its a somewhat deep film that makes you think about how threats are handled, at a global level, the responses by various governments and the like. If anything, I found it refreshing that in this instance, the US didn't exactly go in 'all guns blazing' and I appreciated that the main character, Louise Banks, tries very hard to understand and see things from the unknowns' point of view.

The other nations have a different plan and it is important to keep the peace. Arrival is a great science fiction film with the theme: landing of aliens. Treated differently than most blockbuster films. In most films, the objects are immediately shot at and the aliens attack. At Arrival everyone acts rationally and wants to find out what kind of objects they are and what the residents want. As a viewer, you think about what it could be and whether the residents are evil. What the film does particularly well is the visual implementation and the sound. The aliens look scary and could be from a horror movie. The tension is well maintained and it never gets boring. The beginning of the film is very emotional, which I didn't expect. The way they try to communicate is very interesting and well done and everyone tries to interpret something for themselves. I guessed some of the film's twist, but I was still shocked and didn't expect some things. The ending, like the beginning, is very emotional and beautiful. Ian's character isn't highlighted much, the film focuses more on Louise, whereas Ian seems to just be there to make the ending work. 9/10</td>\n","      <td>APR 26, 2023</td>\n","      <td>9.0</td>\n","      <td>Mistery</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>17</th>\n","      <td>Arrival</td>\n","      <td>The best thriller/sci-fi film I have ever seen in my life.

Until it turned weird. Then, not so much anymore. With a class A cast including Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and Forest Whitaker this should have been a great movie all the way to the end. Except that it wasn’t. It was a great movie until it stopped being that. I had high hopes for it and as such I was left slightly disappointed. Arrival is a good story with a ton of potential for greatness until it got whacked on the head and it all went belly up. For some reason I can’t help comparing it to the 1997 movie Contact, starring the iconic Jodie Foster, which kind of had the same problem. Great movie with a great story until the moment it went all pear shaped. The Story Twelve pods of unknown makeup and origin have appeared overnight at seemingly random locations around the globe. As to be expected the media goes nuts and social services break down. School is out. Louise Banks (Amy Adams) is a successful linguistics professor who stands in from of an empty class room the next day. She highly regarded in her field and has done highly classified consultancy work for the government in the past. Because of this it comes as no big surprise when she gets approached by the military. They need her help in decoding the language of the aliens and once that is done they want her to establish communications with the visitors. For this mission she gets a team of people and works closely together with Ian Donnelly, a theoretical physicist, portrayed by Jeremy Renner. All twelve pods have positioned themselves at seemingly arbitrary coordinates all over the world. The local governments are scrambling to establish contact with the aliens and try to learn as much as they can about ‘their’ pods. They all have a fall out about how to proceed and one by one they end up shutting down communication with the rest of the world. Everyone is now acting isolated without knowing what the others are doing or how far they are with their work to decipher the purpose of the visit. This of course creates an explosive situation that threatens to get out of hand when gossip has it that the Chinese are contemplating to nuke their pod in search for answers. This of course is not an ideal situation for anyone, as no one knows if and how the aliens or the neighbours, for that matter, will retaliate. Here is where it went wrong In between her work Louise has these strange flashbacks to her family, mainly her daughter. Except that we learn she doesn’t have a family nor a daughter. These flashbacks are just that, but that the events have not actually happened yet. They will happen in the future. And that, because she now speaks the aliens language, time doesn’t follow in a straight line for her anymore but in parallel strings all mixed up. Say what? This is where is turned south for me. I am good with weird and strange. But that was too much for me. In that moment the movie lost its credibility in my eyes. I know there are concepts out there about time and space and astro physics. In fact I am very interest in the subject. I have read several read books and listened to countless podcasts about it. But the way it was done in the movie is just ridiculous. I am very sorry. Final thoughts I suppose we can draw similarities to todays society, which is rather trigger happy. We constantly on the cusp **** catastrophe even without the presence of aliens. This raises the question of what will it take for humankind to step back from the abyss. What is needed for people to start working together instead of against each other? Arrival also touches on another question. A moral one that people ask themselves daily. If you knew the future and the way your life would turn out to be, would you change anything? If you knew that by accepting the greatest gift and joy you would ever get, you would also set yourself up the the most desperate pain. Would you still chose the same path? Its a powerful message. I just wish they would have found a different way to convey it.</td>\n","      <td>DEC 25, 2016</td>\n","      <td>5.0</td>\n","      <td>Mistery</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>37</th>\n","      <td>Arrival</td>\n","      <td>Cheap time travel as memory tricks doomed this only passing scifi flick with trite explanations, ignoring gaping logic holes dealing with the two main characters.

movie developes around the ability of a character to understand a language  In a way  Adams  character is a child  humanity  learning to speak  She has to go through all the tribulations of learning a new language  a powerful one at that  The premise is quite interesting and it took me two views to get it  Your language  the way you express what you think  determines your reality  They even mention it at the beginning of the movie  with the Sapir Whorf theory  This is by far a very metaphysical proposal  and a very adecuate one at that  one that has been told to us by great master of ancient   For by your words you will be justified  and by your words you will be condemned    In a way  language IS reality  it is the only way we have to describe it and thus create it  So it would make sense that a more powerful language would create a different  more powerful reality  In the movie  learning the aliens  language would opne the doors of time and space for you  and this can be wither a weapon  as first understood by humans  or a gift  as later realized by Adams  Of course the ability to thread between past  present and future could be a powerful weapon  or a great gift  Once she realizes this  it is quite interesting that she still chooses to have her baby  aware of the outcome  but the most important choice she makes  while having the ability to visit the past or future  is to live in the present  Powerful message indeed  So now you know  choose your words carefully    \n","\n","    Created at  Score    Genre  \n","0  OCT 3, 2022   10.0  Mistery  \n","1  MAR 7, 2022
